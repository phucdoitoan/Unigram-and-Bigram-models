# Unigram-and-Bigram-models
Implementing unigram and bigram models for a simple input method: input sequence of number (0-9) and space bar -> output a proper sentence (for example, in English).

The models are trained on corpus of sentences extracted from Jack London's novels, containing about 20,000 sentences - 285,000 words.

The simple Unigram achieves accuracy of 74%, while the Bigram model achieves accuracy of 90%.

(The jupyter notebook file said it contains 5674 lines, but most of that are just the converted sentences printed out by the models, not the code lines. The main code is not long)
