BTS He sprang upon White Fang and began savagely to kick him
BTS He scrambled backward bursting out in an astonished explosion of ki-yi's
BTS We had sailed since daylight across a sea barren of seals and were now running into the herd
BTS Here debauched a deep gorge with precipitous volcanic walls which no man could scale
BTS but he paid no heed to the stinging lash and the man had not the heart to strike harder
BTS The she-wolf was one leap behind One Ear and holding her own
BTS And such a waist
BTS Yes I've been watching it was Wolf Larsen's calm reply
BTS I showed him the human wrecks cast aside by the industrial machine and he listened to their life stories
BTS But Beauty Smith had not created himself and no blame was to be attached to him
BTS Then the wind came fair and fresh and the boat was soon labouring through a heavy sea toward the island
BTS It went faster and faster and the shorter his money-sack grew the shorter grew his temper
BTS There are seven boats aboard the captain's dingey and the six which the hunters will use
BTS In the violence and turbulence of such disagreements much property was destroyed and many lives lost
BTS There was something calling to him out there in the open
BTS He had learned another lesson of his bondage
BTS Hereafter you shall stand watches receive seventy-five dollars per month and be addressed fore and aft as Mr
BTS He was a magnificent atavism a man so purely primitive that he was of the type that came into the world before the development of the moral nature
BTS The sailors trooped noisily aft some of the watch below rubbing the sleep from their eyes and talked in low tones together
BTS He was asleep on his back and breathing as placidly as a woman
BTS He knew well the psychology of the little thing and it was the little things by which he kept the crew worked up to the verge of madness
BTS I ain't afraid
BTS He could see them beyond Spitz and to either side half crouching for the spring their eyes fixed upon him
BTS She half started back
BTS But Weedon Scott was not listening
BTS It was terrible
BTS All was quiet as we entered Chicago
BTS Once out of his presence I calculated the time
BTS There were a dozen of these states but the Grangers who had been elected were not permitted to take office
BTS The men remained grouped amidships
BTS The hired foreign palace guards of Louis XVI a king of France that was beheaded by his people
BTS The different lines were rapidly approaching a point
BTS Again from its brumal sleep Wakens the ferine strain
BTS And then shame came to him
BTS There was my last skipper w'y I thought nothin' of droppin' down in the cabin for a little chat and a friendly glass
BTS You never knew wot it was to go 'ungry to cry yerself asleep with yer little belly gnawin' an' gnawin' like a rat inside yer
BTS Grey Beaver got the thirst
BTS The flying men were sheepishly coming back but all the while their eyes were raised apprehensively to the many-windowed lofty buildings that towered like the sheer walls of a canyon on each side of the street
BTS Several buckets of water sufficed to put out the burning mattress in the middle of the steerage floor
BTS Everywhere was a thick litter of discarded and ragged garments old sea-boots leaky oilskins all the worthless forecastle dunnage of a long voyage
BTS Many terrorist organizations unaffiliated with us sprang into existence and caused us much trouble
BTS The boat itself was crushed and splintered against the schooner's side as it came inboard
BTS You see the sacredness of our hospitality I said bitterly to Maud Brewster
BTS There you have it
BTS And in place of the merchant class of bourgeoisie will be the labor castes
BTS He was in too quickly for that and if he missed was out again too quickly
BTS Then Buck took to rushing as though for the throat when suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of Spitz as a ram by which to overthrow him
BTS They will be slaves like all the rest of us and they will become about the most bestial of all of us
BTS ' Oh well we've managed so far without it she said cheerfully
BTS It would be impossible for me to write all that was said in the discussion
BTS But I was not destined never to see him again
BTS In the past White Fang had experienced delayed punishments and he apprehended that such a one was about to befall him
BTS The boat flirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up while Thornton flung sheer out of it was carried down-stream toward the worst part of the rapids a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live
BTS Such a war would virtually put the Oligarchy in possession of the world-market
BTS Asmunsen answered sadly
BTS What then when every country in the world has an unconsumed surplus
BTS The hours passed like ages
BTS There were butcher-shops where meat hung within reach
BTS But no master came
BTS It was twelve o'clock
BTS and the halyards running through various blocks on the gaff and mast gave him separate holds for hands and feet
BTS It was a jealous note and he was very careful in keeping a respectful distance
BTS Yet it was a secret growth
BTS They could not go to the cities for there also the Plutocracy was in control
BTS There are no Republicans nor Democrats in this House
BTS On the other hand it was held that a simultaneous jail-delivery all over the land would have immense psychological influence on the proletariat
BTS Here there was a stir of dissent around the table
BTS But I am independent
BTS but that is no reason that I should not try to be shattered as little as possible
BTS and he could hear the cries of the man-animals the sound of clubs striking upon bodies and the yelps of pain from the dogs so struck
BTS The Thirty Mile River was wide open
BTS We could hear the rising roar of it
BTS But the gods had given him a different environment and he was moulded into a dog that was rather wolfish but that was a dog and not a wolf
BTS His wife was in ill health and he was unable to earn by his rattan-work and peddling sufficient food for the family
BTS My pulse rushed up in an unwonted manner yet my rage mounted with it
BTS Its forty feet of length would supply the height necessary properly to swing the mast
BTS He'll never stand the climate
BTS He did not know what evil was threatened by those insistent hands
BTS The Ghost lay half-a-mile beyond the surf-line of a lonely beach
BTS Nothing was to be seen of the strange steamboat which had caused the disaster though I heard men saying that she would undoubtedly send boats to our assistance
BTS The dust of the road arose in a cloud and screened the battle
BTS If that pack ever starts to jump you them three cartridges'd be wuth no more'n three whoops in hell
BTS The hair rippled up along his back at the sight
BTS And after two or three painful adventures with the mothers of part-grown puppies he came into the knowledge that it was always good policy to let such mothers alone to keep away from them as far as possible and to avoid them when he saw them coming
BTS Go to your meekest little assistant instructor of sociology and ask him what is the difference between Rousseau's theory of the return to nature and the theory of socialism
BTS Their hope lies in keeping a weather position so that they may run before the wind for the schooner when it breezes up
BTS Tackles were made fast and lines flung to the men who scrambled aboard like monkeys
BTS So fresh was it that he knew it immediately for what it was
BTS And with every rock he struck he yelped
BTS Yes Mr
BTS I could not swim but before I could sink I was swept back again
BTS Wolf Larsen shall live in the steerage
BTS What is it all about
BTS They were stiff and in pain
BTS Don't arouse this man's animosity
BTS We surely are not to expect some wildly romantic sea-story from your sober pen
BTS For some reason though I know not why in the argument so utterly had I lost it in the contemplation of one stray brown lock of Maud's hair he quoted from Iseult at Tintagel where she says Blessed am I beyond women even herein That beyond all born women is my sin And perfect my transgression
BTS In the morning when the master came out on to the porch fifty white Leghorn hens laid out in a row by the groom greeted his eyes
BTS Ernest's manner changed on the instant
BTS I had glanced occasionally at the approaching schooner and it was now almost abreast of us and not more than a couple of hundred yards away
BTS In spite of the maturity of his years and of the savage rigidity of the mould that had formed him his nature was undergoing an expansion
BTS Here was the original cause for the voyages of discovery
BTS But White Fang refused to growl
BTS You should have seen him when he came on board
BTS You exert all your puny strength to struggle to live
BTS I see Cooky's finish I heard Smoke say to Horner
BTS The rest of mankind was as nothing
BTS Hal and his sister and brother-in-law listened unwillingly pitched tent and overhauled the outfit
BTS Asmunsen cried and many voices backed his decision
BTS but here you will find them misconceptions
BTS it is the means to power and power is governmental
BTS My brother got me inside forty-eight hours and through no fault of mine
BTS His newborn cunning gave him poise and control
BTS I was afraid of them
BTS Eh
BTS He snarled more menacingly crouched still lower and still the hand descended
BTS Quite the opposite
BTS I'll tell you a way to get rid of the surplus Ernest said
BTS The refuges all over the land were quite empty I imagine of comrades that night
BTS As I have said there is much light that I alone can throw upon his character
BTS It struck him on the side
BTS Gee
BTS Walk over and examine those lanyards he said pointing to where the mizzen-rigging should have been
BTS Shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green
BTS Unlike any other wall with which he had had experience this wall seemed to recede from him as he approached
BTS To us he was full of potentiality
BTS no
BTS I served as assistant while he probed and cleansed the passages made by the bullets and I saw the two men endure his crude surgery without anaesthetics and with no more to uphold them than a stiff tumbler of whisky
BTS But he disregarded my protest
BTS What is the matter
BTS It's only the fleeting form we may demolish
BTS Returning to the cave she entered its narrow mouth
BTS It was dim-lighted
BTS In the end there remained only four the she-wolf the young leader the one-eyed one and the ambitious three-year-old
BTS Were they in the tent
BTS We who by personal experience know nothing of bloodshed must not judge harshly the heroes of the Fighting Groups
BTS And with the exception of a solitary man no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known as College Park
BTS But now I know
BTS But Mercedes interfered crying Oh Hal you mustn't as she caught hold of the whip and wrenched it from him
BTS There were inequalities of surface
BTS It was his own fault
BTS Now just for fun
BTS He began to get accurate measurement of his strength and his weakness and to know when to be bold and when to be cautious
BTS Growth was now routed by fear and he ki-yi'd like any frightened puppy
BTS Ah my boy he shook his head ominously at me 'tis the worst schooner ye could iv selected nor were ye drunk at the time as was I
BTS They were running over the surface of a world frozen and dead
BTS If you talked less with yer mouth and did something with yer hands he'd a-ben done with by now
BTS She took charge of him lifting his head to keep the blood out of it and despatching me to the cabin for a pillow
BTS and he knew that she was used to having things thrown at her
BTS They're after us Bill said the man at the front
BTS E
BTS It is all in the records against you
BTS The whispers of wind became puffs the sails filled the Ghost moved
BTS Though unpursued they were in a sorry plight
BTS A sailor stepped forward obediently
BTS I doubt that he has ever lived so swiftly and keenly before and I honestly envy him sometimes when I see him raging at the summit of passion and sensibility
BTS I'll shut yer mouth
BTS Is it yours
BTS I saw some of the cases at the sanitarium
BTS There seemed a relaxation of his expressionless face which was new
BTS It began with like and out of it slowly developed
BTS In that day there were many thousands of these poor merchants called PEDLERS
BTS He was quite out of himself and I noticed the unconscious movement of his lips as he shaped word for word as fast as she uttered them
BTS Dying men had sworn to it and to the mine the site of which it marked clinching their testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the Northland
BTS The dislike of the wolf for close quarters was his to an unusual degree
BTS There was a slight flush under his bronze but otherwise he bore no signs of the battle
BTS It was a matter of vital importance that brought me there that night
BTS All things happened abruptly on that day and with an abruptness that was sickening the mob checked itself
BTS It is almost laughable now when I look back on it the way father was beaten
BTS I could be happy anywhere with Ernest
BTS for a certain tie of attachment was forming between him and his surly lord
BTS The relations among the men strained and made tense by feuds quarrels and grudges were in a state of unstable equilibrium and evil passions flared up in flame like prairie-grass
BTS After that came a kindly blank
BTS He waited a moment as though seeking where to begin and then said Hump do you know the parable of the sower who went forth to sow
BTS Only the small capitalists competed and therefore they did the advertising
BTS Suppose we refuse to turn the government over to you after you have captured it at the ballot-box
BTS for we returned at one o'clock rested and strengthened by a hearty dinner
BTS It did not take long to come to an understanding
BTS After this event he found a warmer place in the hearts of the Sierra Vista people and even the groom whose arm he had slashed admitted that he was a wise dog even if he was a wolf
BTS If there had been one mast standing something high up to which to fasten blocks and tackles
BTS You poor devil said John Thornton and Buck licked his hand
BTS I paused to listen for the breathing of the men but there was no breathing
BTS It may be a weakness of mine that I have an incisive way of speech
BTS That's clear isn't it
BTS You must make yourself over again so that even I would not know you--your voice your gestures your mannerisms your carriage your walk everything
BTS but while he was in shoulder had at last squarely met shoulder
BTS Miss Brewster we had learned her name from the engineer slept on and on
BTS Dead he answered
BTS Mugridge's arm and help him up on deck
BTS Again the rim ice broke away before and behind and there was no escape except up the cliff
BTS It was the Ghost herself that lured Johnson into signing for the voyage but he is already beginning to repent
BTS For six years the rebuilding of San Francisco had been going on and his business had quadrupled and octupled and yet he was no better off
BTS It was an unprecedented thing on sealing-schooners where it is the custom for the hunters to rank unofficially as officers
BTS But he rolled into my marmalade and underclothes and against the trap-door
BTS Now I could harden my heart
BTS In fact she was once a private yacht and was built for speed
BTS What did they want with him these strange men
BTS From the man's distorted body and twisted mind in occult ways like mists rising from malarial marshes came emanations of the unhealth within
BTS John Thornton was sitting near the edge Buck at his shoulder
BTS The desires for the good grub and soft beds ashore which a handsome pay-day brings them the women and the drink the gorging and the beastliness which so truly expresses them the best that is in them their highest aspirations their ideals if you please
BTS also that he was a remittance man and was paid to keep away from England p'yed 'ansomely sir was the way he put it
BTS Good Lord do you think you're travelling on a Pullman
BTS the true
BTS Once he gained his feet but his legs were too weak to sustain him and he slowly wilted and sank back into the snow
BTS This terrible castigation of her hundred-thousand-dollar lawyer was too much for Miss Brentwood's nerves
BTS For the first time he was being really man-handled
BTS Yes it did
BTS I halted
BTS Then we raced and wildly across the wild sea the while I hung like a fly in the crosstrees and searched for the other boats
BTS but he remained interested in the other sounds faint muffled sobbings and slubberings
BTS He might have lived to a ripe old age if he'd stayed at home Henry agreed
BTS With a snarl she sprang upon One Ear
BTS It was not for me this greatest thing in the world I had decided
BTS Later he observed that the boy and girl were of great value in the master's eyes
BTS You will observe Miss Brewster that he carries a dirk in his belt a ahem a most unusual thing for a ship's officer to do
BTS That was the most incongruous of all--the overalls frayed at the bottoms dragged down at the heels and held up by a narrow leather belt around the hips such as laborers wear
BTS he saw to the welfare of his as if they were his own children because he could not help it
BTS I don't know he answered shaking his head
BTS Mine
BTS The bull-dog missed by a hair's-breadth and cries of praise went up as White Fang doubled suddenly out of danger in the opposite direction
BTS You are leaving the battle-field like cowards
BTS I'll lock White Fang in with the chickens all afternoon
BTS he wailed
BTS Then a change in their position diverted him
BTS but he was not broken
BTS Labor was bloody and sullen but crushed
BTS A fair wind and a flowing sheet you know or however it goes
BTS There was an angry gleam in the hunter's eye but he turned on his heel and entered the steerage companion-way where he remained looking upward
BTS I could see him only as living always and dominating always fighting and destroying himself surviving
BTS but it was the treatment he received
BTS The good
BTS Deep in him below any reasoning process or act of consciousness he had associated power with godhead
BTS Get the firelight out of your eyes an' look hard there
BTS I have not been a professor for the sake of my salary
BTS But this is my vessel my particular property
BTS We strolled across the poop to the lee side
BTS When a system is founded upon class how can caste be prevented
BTS He was unafraid of the wild
BTS Don't be afraid of my feelings
BTS Bit by bit infinitely cautious he approached the hand
BTS Is it far
BTS Pools of stagnant water stood around the house their surfaces covered with a green and putrid-looking scum while the stench that arose from them was intolerable
BTS They are not so good as the others but they are very warming
BTS The hut's walls rose without difficulty and everything went smoothly until the problem of the roof confronted me
BTS There were two reasons possibly for this
BTS One of the Indians arose and walked over to him and stooped above him
BTS The rope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current he was jerked under the surface and under the surface he remained till his body struck against the bank and he was hauled out
BTS ' But the man from Texas says 'You've got to put it in my hand
BTS The people ceased work by hundreds of thousands and fled to the mountains there to await the imminent coming of God and the rising of the hundred and forty and four thousand to heaven
BTS The beast in him roared
BTS He refused to let go of me despite the hands of a dozen comrades
BTS There was the awfulness of retribution about it
BTS Let him go I say he repeated
BTS Dat Buck two devils was Francois's rejoinder
BTS Gales we encountered now and again for it was a raw and stormy region and in the middle of June a typhoon most memorable to me and most important because of the changes wrought through it upon my future
BTS We have no way of learning
BTS I looked at him inquiringly
BTS great straining horses pulling huge trucks
BTS You are beginning to dig truth for yourself
BTS and the men like butchers plying their trade naked and red of arm and hand hard at work with ripping and flensing-knives removing the skins from the pretty sea-creatures they had killed
BTS So unnerved was I by the thought of impending violence to Leach and Johnson that my reason must have left me
BTS Once again he took to wandering in the woods but the wild brother came no more
BTS In the great museum at Asgard there is a book entitled Essays in Application written by Henry van Dyke
BTS I could almost have shrieked and flown at his throat with my naked hands before his final cold-blooded instructions were given
BTS I suggested
BTS You have repeatedly confessed to-night by direct avowal or ignorant statement that you do not know the working class
BTS Both tackles were hooked in a trice and the three men deftly timing the roll made a simultaneous leap aboard the schooner
BTS I was seized by the consequent panic and went over the side in a surge of bodies
BTS And then we played hide-and-seek with the blind man
BTS Escape was hopeless out of the question
BTS The world as he saw it was a fierce and brutal world a world without warmth a world in which caresses and affection and the bright sweetnesses of the spirit did not exist
BTS He learned to adjust himself in many ways to his new mode of life
BTS All of which is neither here nor there
BTS Could we but find time and opportunity and utilize the last bit and every bit of the unborn life that is in us we could become the fathers of nations and populate continents
BTS Buck never came near Spitz without snarling and bristling menacingly
BTS That she was frightened and bewildered and that she was bravely striving to hide it was quite plain to me
BTS His arms were around me before I knew
BTS Especially adept did he become in stalking small living things
BTS He stopped and regarded her all of an intentness and eagerness physically expressed that slowly faded out of him as she turned her head and gazed back at the camp
BTS And as for appearance he was the most distinguished-looking man in our society
BTS His handsome coat was draggled
BTS I arose obediently and went down the beach
BTS The hard obstruction of the cave-wall the sharp nudge of his mother's nose the smashing stroke of her paw the hunger unappeased of several famines had borne in upon him that all was not freedom in the world that to life there was limitations and restraints
BTS A companionship did exist between White Fang and the other dogs but it was one of warfare and enmity
BTS They would serve as roof-beams
BTS Therefore come next Tuesday night
BTS If only he knew how many revolutionists his horses have carried
BTS She at least was warm for under her and over her were thick blankets
BTS A recrudescence of anger glinted in Weedon Scott's grey eyes and he muttered savagely The beast
BTS All that remained to be done was the drawing in of the net
BTS but it was impossible to make the dogs travel faster while their own inability to get under way earlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours
BTS Again I fell to chafing her hands and to moving her arms up and down and about until she could thrash them herself
BTS At the current price of skins in the London market and based on a fair estimate of what the afternoon's catch would have been had not the Macedonia hogged it the Ghost has lost about fifteen hundred dollars' worth of skins
BTS He followed with wild leapings in a frenzy to overtake
BTS His comrade looked at him curiously
BTS And at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them
BTS Then he prepared to saw across with the draw-knife
BTS Dave and Sol-leks were unaffected but the rest of the team went from bad to worse
BTS Spencer
BTS By this time the column on the street was almost on us
BTS With the accumulation of vast fortunes the problem of disposing of these fortunes after death was a vexing one to the accumulators
BTS White Fang growled and growled with insistent warning
BTS Wolf Larsen cried
BTS All my wrongs and humiliations flashed upon me with a dazzling brightness all that I had suffered and others had suffered at his hands all the enormity of the man's very existence
BTS It is not the law
BTS He even went out of his way to bully Buck striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the death of one or the other
BTS He was still a sick man and I more than once observed him creeping painfully aloft to a topsail or drooping wearily as he stood at the wheel
BTS When Mit-sah told the story in camp Grey Beaver ordered meat to be given to White Fang
BTS Is he
BTS And the trusts themselves destroyed competition
BTS But White Fang sat on his haunches and ki-yi'd and ki-yi'd a forlorn and pitiable little figure in the midst of the man-animals
BTS And Buck was truly a red-eyed devil as he drew himself together for the spring hair bristling mouth foaming a mad glitter in his blood-shot eyes
BTS The door closed and she was gone
BTS Father made no outcry
BTS his new owner asked
BTS And out of the dividends magnificent churches are builded in New England wherein your kind preaches pleasant platitudes to the sleek full-bellied recipients of those dividends
BTS It was a sea-fitting for the buccaneers and pirates of by-gone years
BTS Because we are so made I guess
BTS We agreed also that the effect of unloading this surplus on another country would be to develop the resources of that country and that in a short time that country would have an unconsumed surplus
BTS She sneezed continually and her stub of a tail was doing its best toward lashing about by giving quick violent jerks
BTS From there he gained the roof of a chicken-house passed over the ridgepole and dropped to the ground inside
BTS It was an inevitable concomitant of the subterranean warfare that raged through those three centuries
BTS He sipped his tea and smiled at me while I ran over the pages
BTS Mercedes cried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article after article was thrown out
BTS He was a weak and inefficient-looking man the lawyer and at sight of him I did not wonder that Jackson's case had been lost
BTS There's nothing to be afraid of or ashamed of I hope Ernest challenged
BTS Yes Mr
BTS Some were lying down with heads raised and ears pricked forward
BTS We were talking about this yesterday he said
BTS Let us wait
BTS Maud saw that I had achieved a solution and her eyes warmed sympathetically
BTS Behind him would be Mit-sah the great whip singing in his hand
BTS His mother heard it too
BTS Not alone with their own eyes did they see the wolfish creature in the clear light of day standing before them
BTS But scarcely had he lain down when Grey Beaver staggered over to him and tied a leather thong around his neck
BTS He wore the uniform of the Mercenaries
BTS I could hear my heart beating as I crouched low in the boat
BTS Primitive man was a puny creature hiding in the crevices of the rocks
BTS For two days and nights Buck never left camp never let Thornton out of his sight
BTS It was a big bull they first found
BTS What is done with it
BTS Hanging over the cook's arm was a loose and crumpled array of evil-looking and sour-smelling garments
BTS That may serve you in your business but you can't talk to me like that
BTS Will you trust your life to it
BTS Eternity is eternity and though you die here and now you will go on living somewhere else and hereafter
BTS At the end of fifteen minutes the carriage swung in through a stone gateway and on between a double row of arched and interlacing walnut trees
BTS Prisons banishment and degradation honors and palaces and wonder-cities are all incidental
BTS Grab hold of something and hang on the red-faced man said to me
BTS Truly Humphrey Van Weyden was at last in love I thought as her fingers clung to mine while I lowered her down to the boat
BTS The unnecessary noise he made I had lain wide-eyed the whole night must have awakened one of the hunters
BTS I know what I shall do to-morrow the first thing run out a light anchor and kedge the schooner off the beach
BTS Convention the Bishop being a gentle soul had yielded to the friendly pressure brought to bear upon him and had gone away on a vacation
BTS The Preacher who was king over Israel in Jerusalem thought as I think
BTS When all was arranged snugly she said Now sir to bed
BTS I started to go and Galvin wrung my hand
BTS A lynx's lair is not despoiled with impunity
BTS She too had noticed the power of the repeated please
BTS We've got three cartridges
BTS I was aware of the compliment and pleased in that no threat had accompanied my instructions
BTS she demanded
BTS He was caught in the miniature rapid at the bottom of the pool
BTS I met men he said who invoked the name of the Prince of Peace in their diatribes against war and who put rifles in the hands of Pinkertons with which to shoot down strikers in their own factories
BTS I pointed it out to Maud and hurriedly led her aft to the safety of the poop
BTS He was sprawling through solidity
BTS I got out a heavy shirt new from the slop-chest and made from blanket goods
BTS My name is Johnson not Yonson he said in very good though slow English with no more than a shade of accent to it
BTS One of his attacks I whispered to Maud
BTS We'll let him run loose and see what kindness can do for him
BTS To accomplish the change was like a reflux of being and this when the plasticity of youth was no longer his
BTS 'Oo was there to send me to school or put tommy in my 'ungry belly or wipe my bloody nose for me w'en I was a kiddy
BTS We must provoke no scenes with this man nor cross his will
BTS He smiled when I asked him the reason the newspapers suppressed all mention of Jackson or his case
BTS They were merely incredulous that was all
BTS Leather harness was on the dogs and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind
BTS They did not seem to know anything these newcomers
BTS His little body rounded out with the meat he now ate
BTS For nineteen years now the refuge that I selected had been almost continuously occupied and in all that time with one exception it has never been discovered by an outsider
BTS He no longer appeared at our Pell Street quarters
BTS Then amongst the sticks themselves appeared a live thing twisting and turning of a colour like the colour of the sun in the sky
BTS He lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet
BTS Many similar outrages that dovetailed with the plot of the revolutionists were given
BTS The barometer was down and the sky to the east did not please him
BTS The situation was now reversed
BTS You are surely a free agent
BTS Had they remained on the solid earth they would have found it easily enough--ay they would have found that they themselves were precisely testing truth with every practical act and thought of their lives
BTS Had it not been my custom to run up to see him every Saturday afternoon and to stop over till Monday morning this particular January Monday morning would not have found me afloat on San Francisco Bay
BTS And this was the epitaph of a dead dog on the Northland trail less scant than the epitaph of many another dog of many a man
BTS and White Fang slunk away to the sheltering woods his head turned to observe as he glided softly over the ground
BTS And I am very happy--indeed most happy
BTS My headache was no better and the surgeon paused from his work long enough to give me a powerful drug that would depress the heart and bring relief
BTS I bespeak the privilege then of enlightening him in jurisprudence Biedenbach cried
BTS And as with California so elsewhere
BTS Here I was especially awkward
BTS A thousand looms assembled in a large factory and driven by a central engine wove cloth vastly more cheaply than could the cottage weavers on their hand-looms
BTS Your hand is clutching my arm lightly it feels as a butterfly resting there
BTS Yes that was what kept the profits down
BTS But whatever idea was forming in his mind was dissipated by the she-wolf who advanced upon him sniffed noses with him for a fleeting instant and then resumed her coy retreat before his renewed advances
BTS The railroads controlling rates and the bankers and stock exchange gamesters controlling prices had long since bled the farmers into indebtedness
BTS Calvin answered and he looked belligerent enough
BTS My mistake was in ever opening the books
BTS And your minds are filled with doctrines that are buttresses of the established order
BTS If she comes out of there he said hard and snappy putting us to windward of the boats it's likely there'll be empty bunks in steerage and fo'c'sle
BTS He knew the breed though he had never met it so far north before
BTS The very atmosphere he breathed was surcharged with hatred and malice and this but served to increase the hatred and malice within him
BTS He broke into the long easy lope and went on hour after hour never at loss for the tangled way heading straight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that put man and his magnetic needle to shame
BTS And all the wonder in the completion Maud added
BTS He was learning to calculate his own muscular movements to know his physical limitations to measure distances between objects and between objects and himself
BTS But the hawk refused to come down and give battle and the cub crawled away into a thicket and whimpered his disappointment and hunger
BTS At first I could make out nothing
BTS You're off colour that's what's the matter with you Henry dogmatised
BTS If you'll come with me in the boat we'll get to work and straighten things out
BTS We are in power
BTS I managed to struggle to my feet
BTS and when Beauty Smith gave up and withdrew the defiant growl followed after him or White Fang sprang at the bars of the cage bellowing his hatred
BTS I wouldn't whisper my suspicions to a soul but somehow I don't think I'll leave Chicago alive
BTS Sometimes this gurgle became sibilant almost a whistle
BTS behind Grey Beaver were a club and godhead
BTS He is very sick and worse than that he has got out of hand
BTS and also this sleek capitalist owned the machine the machine boss and the railroads that issued the passes
BTS And had her eyes so spoken to me
BTS When I asked him if he had broken some rule of working the machinery he shook his head
BTS There they broke out in ever recurring mobs and riots
BTS It is truly perilous
BTS The mother called them to her and comforted them telling them not to bother White Fang
BTS he has but to fall down and kiss her breast and he is strong again
BTS He did not repeat his suggestion though he knew only too well the sore straits the Socialist Party was in through lack of money
BTS Starting from a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire a dispute which concerned only Charles and Hal presently would be lugged in the rest of the family fathers mothers uncles cousins people thousands of miles away and some of them dead
BTS One day the Bishop disappeared
BTS It was a clumsy way but it did not take long and soon the foresail as well was up and fluttering
BTS And struggle on Johnson did
BTS But greatest of all the advantages in White Fang's favour was his experience
BTS He had learned to laugh
BTS And there's no reason why we cannot still manage without it
BTS Some were short-legged too short
BTS From then on he had risen like a rocket
BTS He looked at me with surprise and alarm then he seemed to wilt away
BTS There were so many of the man-animals men women and children all making noises and irritations
BTS and there to leeward in the troubled silver of the rising sun appeared and disappeared a black speck
BTS Are you discussing the ideal man
BTS He continued up the right fork
BTS CHAPTER III THE REIGN OF HATE Under the tutelage of the mad god White Fang became a fiend
BTS I am a revolutionist and it is a perilous vocation
BTS You impeach my sober judgment and make my canons of little worth
BTS Thornton stepped well back
BTS She died in solitary confinement after horrible and prolonged torture
BTS Keep your eyes upon Knowlton
BTS and it was the she-wolf who was first to spring away from the cornered man in his circle of dying flame
BTS On their backs in bags that fastened tightly around underneath the dogs carried from twenty to thirty pounds of weight
BTS There he drowsed only half asleep his ears keyed for the first sound of the familiar step
BTS He caught his breath once or twice and sobbed
BTS Well I think doing a few things for yourself will hardly dislocate any joints
BTS It's childish I laughed later for him to do such things and for me to grow angry over them for that matter
BTS Show me that my indictment is wrong
BTS Surely he had little reason to be afraid
BTS The oligarchs themselves were going through a remarkable and it must be confessed unexpected development
BTS I turned aside caught my breath and looked again
BTS As I was sayin' Henry we've got six dogs
BTS I asked
BTS But Louis took and gave a spoke and gazed imperturbably into the binnacle
BTS But there was a look of bewilderment also in her eyes
BTS With my own hands I did it
BTS It was a small live thing and he had no fear
BTS He was surprised
BTS And north we travelled with it ravaging and destroying flinging the naked carcasses to the shark and salting down the skins so that they might later adorn the fair shoulders of the women of the cities
BTS He regained his balance by the steerage companion-way and stood there dizzily for a space when he suddenly crumpled up and collapsed his legs bending under him as he sank to the deck
BTS Then Maud pressed and held the fingers about the pencil with her own hand and the hand wrote in large letters and so slowly that the minutes ticked off to each letter B-O-S-H
BTS The people of the abyss--this phrase was struck out by the genius of H
BTS Nine feet
BTS Though it's little faith I'm having John that the beast can do the trick
BTS What'd it look like
BTS Ernest laughed
BTS In his confession he states explicitly that he was informed that the bomb was to be a feeble thing and that no lives would be lost
BTS And through it all calm and impassive leaning on his elbow and gazing down Wolf Larsen seemed lost in a great curiosity
BTS Your own hired purveyors of knowledge will tell you that you are wrong
BTS Put up the gun
BTS He sat down beside White Fang holding the end of the thong in his hand
BTS His cocksureness irritated them
BTS Holy smoke
BTS That was all
BTS They hurled stones wielded sticks and clubs and whips administered slaps and clouts and when they touched him were cunning to hurt with pinch and twist and wrench
BTS For this time lost dear heart he said but not forever
BTS Of course the newspapers of the land lived up to the reactionary policy of the ruling class and the destroyed socialist press was misrepresented and vilified while the Black Hundreds were represented as true patriots and saviours of society
BTS I have been working on it for weeks and I cannot make sure
BTS His eyes roved everywhere and they were filled with apprehension and dread
BTS Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities
BTS At last Grey Beaver withheld his hand
BTS I guess the Iron Heel won't need our services Hartman remarked putting down the paper he had been reading when the train pulled into the central depot
BTS I have been reading your 'Working-class Philosophy' I said and his eyes lighted in a pleased way
BTS What do you think I'd have got if I'd won Jackson's case
BTS Sure
BTS Sometimes the revolver shots drowned the voices of Garthwaite and the officer and they were compelled to repeat what they had been saying
BTS She made a wry pucker with her mouth as though to advertise her ignorance of dressmaking
BTS Then Mr
BTS Look at that Bill Henry whispered
BTS And then it surely was congenial work for Ernest and furthermore my jealous pride in him made me hail the proffered appointment as a recognition of his abilities
BTS While Ernest slept I changed my dress arranged my hair differently and came back to my new automatic self
BTS Not only were we sure of being dry and warm and sheltered from the wind but we had the softest and most luxurious mattresses that could be made from moss
BTS In vain he strove to drive them back
BTS It was a hard day's run up the Canon through Sheep Camp past the Scales and the timber line across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep and over the great Chilcoot Divide which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely North
BTS How is this wealth owned by these three classes
BTS Dr
BTS And they're all heading for Chicago
BTS And after the guests were gone I learned how he had met him passing down a street at night and stopping to listen to a man on a soap-box who was addressing a crowd of workingmen
BTS And to save his face he turned fiercely upon the onlookers
BTS the instincts which were but the memories of his ancestors become habits which had lapsed in later days and still later in him quickened and become alive again
BTS I offer you eight hundred for him sir before the test sir
BTS That also have we considered Ernest replied
BTS Quite as often he understepped and stubbed his feet
BTS A crack dog-doctor there thinks that he can cure 'm
BTS I remember my father giving me a dollar once when I was a little girl for remaining absolutely quiet for five minutes
BTS It seems incredible to us that whole generations should have elapsed after the enunciation of Marx's economic discoveries in which time he was sneered at by the world's accepted thinkers and scholars
BTS The boat had lain there for a long time for it was half filled with sand and the splintered wood had that weather-worn appearance due to long exposure to the elements
BTS It became quite a movement in fact
BTS In the scramble one of the dogs had been overturned on the edge of the fire and it had yelped with pain and fright as the smell of its singed coat possessed the air
BTS but for us who had known the misery of the open boat it was a snug little habitation
BTS He had never been struck by a club in his life and did not understand
BTS CHAPTER XXXII I awoke oppressed by a mysterious sensation
BTS The front man turned his head until his eyes met the eyes of the man behind
BTS Every Granger state was ravaged with violence and washed in blood
BTS A whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils and there curled up under the snow in a snug ball lay Billee
BTS Pervaise was mastered by the fear of death all of which is recounted at length in his confession
BTS his face glowed his eyes snapped and flashed and his chin and jaw were eloquent with aggressiveness
BTS Scott turned upon Beauty Smith
BTS I promise you that you will have the time of your life
BTS Without delight living is a worthless act
BTS The boiler exploded down at the works
BTS He tried to rise to his feet and after several attempts fell down from weakness
BTS He crosses alone from the smiling timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees
BTS He ran on a few steps stopped and looked back
BTS Their wages will go down and their hours will increase
BTS And the worst of it is he knows it
BTS He walked to the galley
BTS Under ordinary circumstances after all that I had undergone I should have been fit for bed and a trained nurse
BTS I cautiously descended the ladder
BTS Hammerfield repeated impatiently
BTS Hers was an extreme lithesomeness and she moved with a certain indefinable airiness approaching one as down might float or as a bird on noiseless wings
BTS His senses accustomed to the hum and bustle of the camp used to the continuous impact of sights and sounds were now left idle
BTS The only difference lay in that the patent medicines were more harmful and more costly
BTS he demanded quick as a flash
BTS But the space on deck where I had left him lying was vacant
BTS There was a ring of triumph in his voice and his eyes clear blue this morning as the sea were sparkling with light
BTS All right he said
BTS law
BTS In the very heart of the herd the din was terrific
BTS I noted the gurgling forefoot was very like a snore and as I listened to it the effect of Wolf Larsen's swift rush from sublime exultation to despair slowly left me
BTS But a change came over the face of the dream for a dream I told myself it must be
BTS When it comes to powder chemical mixtures are better than mechanical mixtures you take my word
BTS There had been no second bomb only a fear of one
BTS He had finally summoned the courage to descend
BTS The problem of reinvestment became more serious
BTS it was the Plutocracy that whipped the churches and especially the Catholic Church into line and robbed us of a portion of the labor vote
BTS It was a careless unpremeditated glance one of those haphazard things men do when they have no immediate call to do anything in particular but act because they are alive and must do something
BTS Oh I haven't quit the fight Mr
BTS Remember he warned my definition is fatal to metaphysics
BTS The latter regarded him wistfully started away then returned and whined softly
BTS The wonder was that Ernest was not executed
BTS What could we do
BTS You foment class hatred I said
BTS It was impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore
BTS But what if the Grangers fail to get possession
BTS CHAPTER IX Three days of rest three blessed days of rest are what I had with Wolf Larsen eating at the cabin table and doing nothing but discuss life literature and the universe the while Thomas Mugridge fumed and raged and did my work as well as his own
BTS The sparkling points of light flashed past me in an interminable stream as though the whole sidereal system were dropping into the void
BTS A number of the labor leaders had been executed
BTS The politicians are always the last people in this country to see what is going on under their noses
BTS He was always striving to attain it
BTS This is such a little thing you know
BTS Stick to it
BTS Does the middle class with its eight million occupied members
BTS I almost gasped as the thought came to me What if the Ghost is deserted
BTS It's all over but the shouting
BTS Suddenly there was a deafening roar
BTS Splay hoofs and palmated antlers they knew and they flung their customary patience and caution to the wind
BTS This spirit had infected the Mercenaries of which three regiments in particular were ready to come over to us en masse
BTS I cannot lay too great stress upon this high ethical righteousness of the whole oligarch class
BTS They attached the line with which they had been snubbing the boat to Buck's neck and shoulders being careful that it should neither strangle him nor impede his swimming and launched him into the stream
BTS he demanded abruptly
BTS I persisted
BTS It was slow work and perilous and often were our efforts rewarded with costly failures
BTS An' I wisht I'd never started on this trip Henry
BTS Their unanimous complaint was against the corporations and trusts
BTS Most of the first month of his life had been passed thus in sleeping
BTS I instance this to show the sensitiveness of my nervous organization at the time and how unused I was to spectacles of brutality
BTS They did not remain in one place but travelled across country until they regained the Mackenzie River down which they slowly went leaving it often to hunt game along the small streams that entered it but always returning to it again
BTS There was his wife Alice and then there were his children Weedon and Maud toddlers of four and six
BTS The cook backed away a fiendish expression on his face the knife held before him in a position of defence
BTS The lack of expression on his face so different from when I had watched him unseen was enhanced by the unblinking staring eyes
BTS Not on yer life was the angry retort
BTS It was a mournful howl and as Buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it was lost in the distance
BTS CHAPTER VI THE LOVE-MASTER As White Fang watched Weedon Scott approach he bristled and snarled to advertise that he would not submit to punishment
BTS The mills were working overtime
BTS Not a wheel moved in his empire
BTS Is it because you have no answer
BTS The news of it was borne in upon him not by sight or sound or smell but by some other and subtler sense
BTS The light from it had beat upon his sealed lids and the eyes and the optic nerves had pulsated to little sparklike flashes warm-coloured and strangely pleasing
BTS As I passed between Harrison and the binnacle which was built into the top of the cabin I noticed that he was this time fully three points off
BTS and that all their days they fester in brutality and viciousness and in the end die as unlovely as they have lived
BTS As for his appearance  He did not finish his sentence
BTS As I softly withdrew I could hear him groaning God
BTS But a cold snap was on the thermometer registering fifty below zero and each time he broke through he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments
BTS They were running along a narrow alley flanked on either side by a growth of young spruce
BTS ' And in the time to come when you rise in your strength remember that you will be rising against the property of the trusts and the liberty of the trusts according to the law to squeeze you
BTS But look at yourself Matt
BTS CHAPTER I I scarcely know where to begin though I sometimes facetiously place the cause of it all to Charley Furuseth's credit
BTS We left the table to go on deck for a steamer was a welcome break in the monotony of the sea on which we floated while the conviction that it was Death Larsen and the Macedonia added to the excitement
BTS Wolf Larsen was on the poop smoking his everlasting cigar
BTS You needn't stray off too far in doin' it his partner admonished
BTS Francois swore strange barbarous oaths and stamped the snow in futile rage and tore his hair
BTS By this time he had swung fully around and was facing me
BTS and there are no proofs to the contrary--in the mind
BTS The next moment the wretched man had wrenched free from his captors and flung himself at my feet his arms clutching me about the knees in a vicelike grip as he prayed in a frenzy for mercy
BTS And his facts made for them a Waterloo
BTS Together they watched the strange animal that had pursued them for days and that had already accomplished the destruction of half their dog-team
BTS And to cap it all when Mercedes with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver in her throat could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more she stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly
BTS But when the strangers walk became stiff-legged and his lips lifted clear of his teeth White Fang stiffened too and answered with lifted lips
BTS It ate away from beneath
BTS The industrial wrong terrible as you say it is is due to ignorance
BTS He made a long pause plainly overcome by the thought that was in him and nervous how best to express it
BTS I saw her lips trembling and the tears swimming up in her eyes
BTS He had learned the lesson and in all his after life he never forgot it
BTS She crept out cautiously on the edge of a large open space in the midst of the trees
BTS Of course this was unconstitutional and of course the United States put its soldiers into the field
BTS The Aurora's whistle hooted a final announcement of departure
BTS There was quite a group about the wreck and two men were just lifting up the wounded officer to carry him to the other machine
BTS Labor in all the oligarchies of the world was prepared to rise at the signal
BTS His mind was rather hazy concerning the damage suit
BTS But no help was offered
BTS The Black Hundreds are being organized in the United States he said
BTS There is no God but Fact and Mr
BTS The love of man and woman I had always held was a sublimated something related to spirit a spiritual bond that linked and drew their souls together
BTS I know you have it in for me Johnson continued with his unalterable and ponderous slowness
BTS everything favoured a big catch
BTS but for you it will be an excellent object lesson
BTS I could kill you now with a blow of my fist for you are a miserable weakling
BTS He was very angry and was cursing the whole secret service
BTS Their masculinity which in itself is of the brute has been over-developed
BTS If it is sincere he amended
BTS And the Ghost is lying as you can see for yourself bow on to the beach
BTS He never chummed with other dogs
BTS Hartman was right
BTS CHAPTER IV THE CLINGING DEATH Beauty Smith slipped the chain from his neck and stepped back
BTS These associations were practically middle-class affairs and now compelled by hard times and crashing markets and aided by the great captains of industry they gave organized labor an awful and decisive defeat
BTS Her father was a wolf
BTS They were slack in all things without order or discipline
BTS I saw his face grow hard and the merciless glitter come into his eyes
BTS I asked
BTS So Collie took advantage of her sex to pick upon White Fang and maltreat him
BTS It was only the tame that the gods protected and between the tame deadly strife was not permitted
BTS At other times I take him for a great man a genius who has never arrived
BTS He had started out preaching it to his sister and brother-in-law
BTS We camp right here
BTS and instead of this being joyful for us it will be a source of grief
BTS Tell him I lived to be sorry for the trouble I brought him and the things I done and and just tell him God bless him' for me
BTS All the railroad unions entered into this combination with the oligarchs and it is of interest to note that the first definite application of the policy of profit-grabbing was made by a railroad union in the nineteenth century A
BTS He had forgotten
BTS He did not pause to worry the victim but ripped in passing with the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man
BTS CHAPTER XXVII Day broke grey and chill
BTS He noticed my involuntary twitching and grimacing and smirked I only 'ope yer don't ever 'ave to get used to such as that in this life 'cos you've got a bloomin' soft skin that you 'ave more like a lydy's than any I know of
BTS But now Lip-lip was his dog and he proceeded to wreak his vengeance on him by putting him at the end of the longest rope
BTS and the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at Seattle
BTS After a while he said We have with us a member of the working class
BTS It's a lee shore I laughed and I am sure I'd rather be here than arriving a night like this
BTS Buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown calf
BTS If you are sure of the rent it is all right
BTS and he was no more timid of a woman than he was of storm and battle
BTS This was his severest fight and though in the end he killed them both he was himself half killed in doing it
BTS The lessons were not tender that he had learned of their tyranny and cruelty in the days of the Indian villages
BTS It was not until he became convinced of the hopelessness of his love affair that he acceded to our wishes and went back to his father
BTS And then he awoke to find the howling real
BTS Three-quarters of it went to the Trust
BTS We've got him
BTS In the meantime the canoe had drifted down the stream
BTS It's all right
BTS It is true we worked hard and for long hours
BTS And ever we were flung off farther and farther to the north-east
BTS The oncoming Harrison caught the kick squarely in the pit of the stomach groaned involuntarily and doubled up and sank backward to the deck
BTS Your stomach's sour
BTS To be piggish as you and I have been all our lives does not seem to be just the thing for immortals to be doing
BTS The Mercenaries constituted a race apart
BTS The case of this young man was not unusual
BTS One was president and the other was secretary of the Western Federation of Miners
BTS Well then just keep a-coming
BTS He came out of a doze that was half nightmare to see the red-hued she-wolf before him
BTS Finally an idea came to him
BTS On the other hand instead of walking away at sight of them he waited for them to come to him
BTS If they left him alone he left them alone a state of affairs that they found after a few encounters to be pre-eminently desirable
BTS Oh no there won't be any escaping if they have anything to say about it
BTS Matthewson's sled loaded with a thousand pounds of flour had been standing for a couple of hours and in the intense cold it was sixty below zero the runners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow
BTS Just glance at your draggled skirts for instance
BTS Grey Beaver was busy trading and getting wealthy
BTS How I had welcomed each of them
BTS No man makes opportunity
BTS For to play a system requires money while the wages of a gardener's helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny
BTS Thornton's command cracked out like a pistol-shot
BTS Beauty Smith had estimated his powers well for he was invariably the victor
BTS I simply could not stand upright and endure the agony
BTS Eh
BTS Wolf Larsen did not seem affected however
BTS When you testified at the trial you didn't point out that Jackson received his accident through trying to save the machinery from damage
BTS The crime at the time was openly charged to the mine owners by the socialists and miners
BTS All of which is neither here nor there
BTS It was Philip Wickson though I did not know him at the time
BTS It is still obscure to me
BTS Pretty
BTS Grey Beaver was a god and strong
BTS At the faint sound of his distant feet before he came in sight White Fang knew who was coming and began to bristle
BTS No it was not easy
BTS White Fang grew stronger heavier and more compact while his character was developing along the lines laid down by his heredity and his environment
BTS It was after the dinner that father told me what little he knew about him
BTS I heard her words with a responsive thrill it was all so dearly intimate and natural and I said It seems as though I have lived this life always
BTS Bill stopped for a moment in order that his words might gain greater significance
BTS He did a great deal of translating for the magazines on scientific and philosophic subjects
BTS Yet the thought of Aristotle ruled Europe for twelve centuries Dr
BTS What of the Macedonia
BTS For a moment he was paralysed
BTS I bowed to and disclaimed the compliment
BTS But with milk two cents higher I should think you could have competed Ernest suggested slyly
BTS Then came the day when the last bandage and the last plaster cast were taken off
BTS Then an agent of the Iron Heel managed to become a member penetrated all its secrets and brought about its total annihilation
BTS two inches
BTS It's the fortresses Hartman said
BTS Yes those who work in the shop get eight cents
BTS As for Wolf Larsen and myself we got along fairly well
BTS I threw open the door
BTS You must take good care of him Matt Scott said as they started down the hill
BTS Or had the strain been too great for him and had he meekly surrendered to the juggernaut of the established
BTS I grew to await it with a nameless dread
BTS There was no thick mat of fur to baffle White Fang's teeth as they were often baffled by dogs of his own breed
BTS By this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the Southland had fallen away from the three people
BTS A minute later he was out again and desperately hobbling on
BTS and there are two thicker volumes the essays which you will pardon my saying and I know not which is flattered more fully equal your verse
BTS White Fang watched the club after the manner of a caged lion watching the whip of its trainer
BTS his brain was purged of the fancy that it was the duty of society to feed the Master's lambs
BTS Maybe the man was insolent
BTS He was very weak and when he reached the lawn he lay down and rested for a while
BTS He awoke with a start
BTS The feeble flame must be cherished tenderly if it were to gather strength and live
BTS At the first step upon the cold surface Buck's feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud
BTS How do you do Captain Larsen she answered
BTS The cub felt the prod of the life that was in him and stood up and snarled valiantly by his mother's side
BTS Mathematical certainty
BTS while two or three fools more or less would not alter the scheme of things
BTS He studied the nail-formation and prodded the finger-tips now sharply and again softly gauging the while the nerve-sensations produced
BTS White Fang had ceased eating lost heart and allowed every dog of the team to thrash him
BTS He ran into sticks and things
BTS For a dog to attack another it would have to turn upon one at a shorter rope
BTS What remains
BTS He treated me vilely cursed me continually and heaped his own work upon me
BTS It was a pitiful spectacle
BTS There's where I ran across altruism' and I remember now how it was used
BTS You sir have brilliantly exemplified my statement
BTS But you tried to prevent it
BTS and he frightened unaware of what constituted this new onslaught struck back ferociously and in still greater fright ripping down the side of the she-wolf's muzzle
BTS Now there you go too far
BTS Red she-wolf
BTS The will to exist of his body surged over him
BTS he queried
BTS Before the oligarchs and before Everhard Wells speculated upon the building of the wonder cities though in his writings they are referred to as pleasure cities
BTS yet all the time I shall be here alive active and powerless
BTS At the first hint of darkness he hastened to make a camp and he saw to it that he had a generous supply of firewood
BTS He was in perfect condition without an ounce of superfluous flesh and the one hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit and virility
BTS Untermann a revolutionist in July 1903 published a pamphlet at Girard Kansas on the Militia Bill
BTS Now you've struck it Ernest said
BTS Who's look-out
BTS and let me begin by saying that you are all mistaken
BTS And lost your shoes
BTS The sudden transition was startling
BTS her canvas loomed darkly in the night
BTS In the north he had learned the lesson that he must let the master's dogs alone and he did not forget that lesson now
BTS Into the militia you would go willy-nilly
BTS Colonel Van Gilbert did not notice the dozen men with passion-wrought faces who strove to get permission from him to speak
BTS An appreciable time after that the great column of the explosion towered in the air and after that in turn I heard the roar of it
BTS A few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark
BTS I could hear Leach crying
BTS But her ear had caught the flaw
BTS No I am not gathering material I assure you was my answer
BTS I turned scornfully away and went aft
BTS It was a dark and evil-appearing thing that hut not fit for aught better than swine in a civilized land
BTS He was called Sol-leks which means the Angry One
BTS The New York Legislature passed a law restricting work in bakeries to ten hours a day
BTS If I was President of the United Stytes to-morrer 'ow would it fill my belly for one time w'en I was a kiddy and it went empty
BTS The dog was thoroughly alive to its danger but it was running on the outer circle while the wolf-pack was running on the inner and shorter circle
BTS This was the first time Buck had failed in itself a sufficient reason to drive Hal into a rage
BTS But it is absurd for you to talk that way
BTS Bosh and nonsense
BTS Baseek was surprised by the other's temerity and swiftness of attack
BTS He did not even think the law
BTS The wind blew the air clear again but no patch of sail broke the troubled surface
BTS There were only three the jib foresail and mainsail
BTS Make fast
BTS Instead of the whole country being hand in hand in revolt they were all alone and the total strength of the Oligarchy could have been directed against them if necessary
BTS And to gain
BTS He licked his chops and waited
BTS Makin' free to spit out what's in me Matt said one day I beg to state that you was a wise guy all right when you paid the price you did for that dog
BTS Scott
BTS Of course I would he cried angrily
BTS The longest day never played White Fang out
BTS In the meantime his two men as was the wont of visiting sailors had gone forward into the forecastle to do some visiting themselves
BTS Nothing really happened then but everything was explained
BTS What commodities do you turn out
BTS But she has erroneous ideas concerning the American flag and the protection it is supposed to symbolize
BTS An Englishman by birth a writer of many books on political economy and philosophy and one of the Socialist leaders of the times
BTS I've told you what's what and let it stop at that
BTS I had had no sleep for forty-eight hours
BTS You call it the Plutocracy
BTS Then as the moments went by it came to me that the situation was analogous to the one in which I had approached the long-maned bull my intention of clubbing obscured by fear until it became a desire to make him run
BTS Here leading up the left fork he came upon a fresh track
BTS As for myself I turned deathly sick
BTS A sordid harsh and meagre life it must have been
BTS They were drunk with conviction of the superiority of their class and of themselves
BTS He uttered a glad little cry and bounded to meet her while the man-animals went back hastily several steps
BTS Contented sounds saluted his ear and when he heard the angry voice of a woman he knew it to be the anger that proceeds from a full stomach
BTS Anything I can do for you
BTS She screamed with fright as he seized her dress in his teeth and dragged on it till the frail fabric tore away
BTS I could see their faces flushed and angry the brutality distorted and emphasized by the sickly yellow of the sea-lamps which rocked back and forth with the ship
BTS False
BTS He seemed greatly perturbed unable to reply to me
BTS Fang clashed fang and lips were cut and bleeding but Buck could not penetrate his enemy's guard
BTS He had been ill-made in the making
BTS and staggered backward
BTS He had been waiting for this
BTS There were no wagons rumbling on the streets no factory whistles no hum of electricity in the air no passing of street cars no cries of news-boys--nothing but persons who at rare intervals went by like furtive ghosts themselves oppressed and made unreal by the silence
BTS And though they were making poor time the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely
BTS But the others did not see this radiance and I assumed that it was due to the tears of joy and love that dimmed my vision
BTS No agent of the Iron Heel was executed without a trial
BTS They had constituted a kind apart and here abruptly he had discovered many more creatures apparently of his own kind
BTS I could scarcely accept the verdict of my senses
BTS All too quickly far more quickly than he had expected it happened
BTS The runners are froze fast
BTS He staggered to his feet and fell down
BTS He was fainting
BTS Or tell me Doctor do you have no apprehension in an earthquake that that incorporeal body of yours will be hit by an immaterial brick
BTS Ernest was in the thick of the fight when the end came
BTS There was no escaping it
BTS Then after the break-up of the ice on the Porcupine he had built a canoe and paddled down that stream to where it effected its junction with the Yukon just under the Artic circle
BTS It is his handiwork
BTS A flush of angry blood pervaded Bill's face
BTS For all that work
BTS But the cook was after me shouting through the lee galley door 'Ere you
BTS Your combination was more effective
BTS And all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down
BTS I am not tied by my heartstrings
BTS Look close there
BTS But he sprang upon the guard one day and used his teeth on the other's throat just like any jungle animal
BTS And then just then the faintest possible whisper of air passed by
BTS It is loathsome to the life that is in me the very essence of which is movement the power of movement and the consciousness of the power of movement
BTS It was evident that he was badly frightened
BTS His letters which had come to me regularly ceased
BTS Maud Brewster accompanied me on deck but I left her at the break of the poop where she might watch the scene and not be in it
BTS Consider yourself and me
BTS Yonson he began
BTS Then there was his lightning quickness
BTS And so it was that father kept on at our Pell Street quarters while Ernest and I went to Washington
BTS And listen to the women scream he said grimly almost bitterly I thought as though he had been through the experience before
BTS The Iron Heel had made up its mind to destroy us and there was no withstanding it
BTS The snow was flying more thickly and White Fang whimpering softly to himself as he stumbled and limped along came upon a fresh trail in the snow
BTS It was a trap
BTS And never had hot coffee tasted so good
BTS Boats were continually being lost and found it being the custom for a boat to hunt on lay with whatever schooner picked it up until such time it was recovered by its own schooner
BTS Are you fishing
BTS The god was actually offering him another piece of meat
BTS It was a difficult cast to make on a rolling ship but the sharp point of the spike whistling seventy-five feet through the air barely missed Wolf Larsen's head as he emerged from the cabin companion-way and drove its length two inches and over into the solid deck-planking
BTS They sought no farther
BTS They carried their whole stock in trade from door to door
BTS I saw her eyes flash with indignation and this time it was I who dropped mine while I felt my face flushing under her gaze
BTS But our captain is a strange man and I beg of you to be prepared for anything understand
BTS And that was the last I saw of Garthwaite for three years
BTS I heard Latimer shout down the scuttle too cautious to descend into the inferno of passion he could hear raging beneath him in the darkness
BTS And not one of them was a free agent he said
BTS He shook his head dolefully lighted his cigarette and sat down beside me
BTS Maud cried jubilantly
BTS It is no less unreal now that I look back upon it
BTS On the other hand instead of having to devote my energy to the learning of a multitude of things I concentrated it upon a few particular things such as for instance the analysis of Poe's place in American literature an essay of mine by the way in the current Atlantic
BTS Ernest queried softly
BTS He had travelled it often and nothing had ever happened on it
BTS He belonged to them as all dogs belonged to them
BTS There was no pulling and hauling on sheets and tackles no shifting of topsails no work at all for the sailors to do except to steer
BTS I recollected the handcuffs in his state-room which he preferred to use on sailors instead of the ancient and clumsy ship irons
BTS From my place in the gallery I saw nothing except the flash of the explosion
BTS The leaders in prison and out were able to discuss and direct the campaign
BTS Out of your own mouths be it he said
BTS The sound of blows and scuffling came to our ears
BTS Then he was successful
BTS Woe to the Iron Heel
BTS Van Weyden is what you may call an authority on such things as rights
BTS The pool itself muddy and discolored from the sluice boxes effectually hid what it contained and it contained John Thornton
BTS But we'll make sailors out of them or boat-pullers at any rate
BTS But it was very unreal at the time
BTS It knows my operating expenses to a cent and it knows the terms of my contracts
BTS nor did he wonder where or why the call sounding imperiously deep in the forest
BTS As the days went by other dogs came in crates and at the ends of ropes some docilely and some raging and roaring as he had come
BTS and the especially acceptable brands are acceptable because they do not menace the established order of society
BTS Without doubt she here refers to the Chicago Commune
BTS Blind and helpless I answered promptly waving him aside as a straw
BTS He had no affection for Grey Beaver
BTS As darkness came on the hunting-cries to right and left and rear drew closer so close that more than once they sent surges of fear through the toiling dogs throwing them into short-lived panics
BTS I drink to Life I drink to Death And smack my lips with song For when I die another 'I' shall pass the cup along
BTS Then there were the pebbles and stones that turned under him when he trod upon them
BTS Dog-mushers' cries were heard
BTS And then in a flash the better solution came to me
BTS Those white gods were strong
BTS After the guests had gone father threw himself into a chair and gave vent to roars of Gargantuan laughter
BTS We have learned
BTS He had been suddenly jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial
BTS Young life had little chance in such a famine
BTS Oh I am not challenging your sincerity Ernest continued
BTS They wouldn't send me to an asylum for that
BTS Life was flowing through him again splendid and indomitable
BTS which runs through many shades and colourings like intershot silk in sunshine
BTS Reassured he whimpered softly
BTS I have often thought so myself and wondered why
BTS How is the Ghost lying
BTS This chitter-chatter drove me to distraction
BTS You do not know us I answered
BTS The pencil dropped and we had to replace it in the hand
BTS I cried out
BTS He was lying as I had left him
BTS And with Hearst crashed also to destruction the Democratic Party that he had so recently captured
BTS Something is coming here to us
BTS Where the river swung in against precipitous bluffs he climbed the high mountains behind
BTS The labor castes were honeycombed by our agents--men whose eyes saw beyond the belly-need the radiant figure of liberty and brotherhood
BTS I noticed that my father was annoyed because Ernest did not talk
BTS The mass swung clear of the ladder the men still clinging to their escaping foe
BTS Wounded creatures men and women were vomited over the top of that awful wave and fell squirming down the face of it till they threshed about under the automobiles and against the legs of the soldiers
BTS The fight had opened at long distance and the rifles were cracking steadily
BTS But that was all
BTS The two girls arrived in a flurry of excitement danger and sudden death
BTS Then dirt and weather-beat shall be your guerdon of honour I said holding them in mine
BTS Thomas Mugridge was beside himself a blithering imbecile so pleased was he at chumming thus with the captain
BTS All this was secret but secrets will out
BTS The four men greeted him with roars of laughter and explanations were made
BTS Hammerfield declined to meet Ernest again
BTS She did not speak but nodded her head
BTS He made no reply
BTS These five groups so amalgamated along with their financial and political allies were 1 James J
BTS When they commanded him to go he went away hurriedly
BTS I demanded with an abruptness that in turn startled her
BTS I won't be mate on this hell-ship
BTS Where will your capitalist system be then
BTS They live for their belly's sake and the belly is for their sake
BTS So near did the wolves approach that the dogs became frantic with terror and it was necessary to replenish the fire from time to time in order to keep the adventurous marauders at safer distance
BTS I remembered the Cockney's way of putting it
BTS When there is only so much of the same thing and when two men want all they can get of the same thing there is a conflict of interest between labor and capital
BTS I had scarcely opened my mouth to issue the necessary commands when eager men were springing to halyards and downhauls and others were racing aloft
BTS I asked
BTS I may be executed or assassinated but I shall never be crucified
BTS that they are hatched out by the sun like turtle eggs or receive life in some similar and sordid fashion
BTS What was wrong
BTS This use of our given names had come about quite as a matter of course and was as unpremeditated as it was natural
BTS Thereafter they spoke no more though their ears were keen for the hunting-cries that continued to rise behind them
BTS Thus would the leaders of the enemy be removed from the field of the local battles that would inevitably be fought all over the land
BTS But there were times when even a moose-bird failed to affect him and those were times when he felt himself to be in danger from some other prowling meat hunter
BTS They met by chance on the ferry-boat to San Francisco so that the warning he gave father was not premeditated
BTS For don't you see the railway men machinists and engineers iron and steel workers do all of the vitally essential work in our machine civilization
BTS My father stopped to listen became interested effected a meeting and after quite an acquaintance invited him to the ministers' dinner
BTS Then you read consciousness
BTS I read the unspoken question there was it right
BTS Ernest went on to his rise in society till at last he came in touch with members of the upper classes and rubbed shoulders with the men who sat in the high places
BTS Ernest queried
BTS But he must have recovered himself quickly for the cab hadn't gone fifty feet before it turned around and came back
BTS Others in the water were clamouring to be taken aboard again
BTS The oil income was swelling swelling and the number of sound investments limited even more limited than it is now
BTS Finding it impossible to dwell in safety in the midst of the betrayed proletariat they moved into new localities inhabited by themselves alone
BTS For that matter they were all loafing Buck John Thornton and Skeet and Nig waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to Dawson
BTS Just now he ran blindly his own bank of the Mackenzie alone entering into his calculations
BTS But it is expedient doctrine
BTS A few minutes sufficed to finish the loading and I lowered the boat into the water
BTS Now you're beginning to understand he said brightening
BTS Francois's whip snapped less frequently and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up his feet and carefully examining them
BTS Garthwaite put his mouth to my ear and shouted but in the frightful din I could not catch what he said
BTS In truth my spells of resting were longer than those of working
BTS The bull-dog's method was to hold what he had and when opportunity favoured to work in for more
BTS They had better food to eat less hours of labor more holidays and a greater amount and variety of interests and pleasures
BTS I failed to recognize him but before I could speak I trod upon something that was alive and that squirmed under my foot
BTS Oh Gawd Gawd wot 'ave I done
BTS That it may not be premature
BTS It was not his way
BTS You are sincere
BTS Her instinctive fear of the father of her progeny was toning down
BTS They were not land serfs like the farmers
BTS About the neck of each dog he had fastened a leather thong
BTS Following the housewarming which was accomplished by means of seal-oil and a wick made from cotton calking came the hunting for our winter's meat and the building of the second hut
BTS The Mercenaries in the last days of the Iron Heel played an important role
BTS She was Charles's wife and Hal's sister a nice family party
BTS When he felt him grasp his tail Buck headed for the bank swimming with all his splendid strength
BTS Supper was at hand and the table not laid
BTS When they were fast bow and stern and the two uninjured men prepared to come aboard the hunter picked up his rifle as if to place it in a secure position
BTS This command was reinforced by a steaming kettle of water and at sight of it the sailors scrambled out of the way
BTS Well give it to him
BTS Here in the old lair he encountered Kiche
BTS The man who plotted beside us for all we knew might be an agent of the Iron Heel
BTS Jordan's final test of truth
BTS They knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the face of that driving current was a matter of minutes and they ran as fast as they could up the bank to a point far above where Thornton was hanging on
BTS Five men he said can produce bread for a thousand
BTS Quickly as a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack he could leap twice as quickly
BTS her lashed wheel creaked as the rudder kicked
BTS Why cannot you return
BTS All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this
BTS They philosophized if you will pardon my misuse of the word about the heart as the seat of the emotions while the scientists were formulating the circulation of the blood
BTS He had been observed the news had been carried to the dead dog's master the squaws remembered all the instances of stolen meat and Grey Beaver was beset by many angry voices
BTS He looked at me and though his eyes were steady and motionless there seemed a cynical smile in them
BTS Winter is almost here
BTS It was too terrible and awful to be true
BTS But it was the heartlessness of it that especially struck me
BTS Carn't yer see you've bloomin' well rubbed all the gent's skin orf
BTS We must club the seals I announced when convinced of my poor marksmanship
BTS Harrison clinging on made the giddy rush through the air
BTS It's no use he said
BTS less proud
BTS Francois came up last after the sled and load
BTS and considering the weak and famished condition of the pack he possessed more than the average vigour and spirit
BTS He inspected the grass beneath him the moss-berry plant just beyond and the dead trunk of the blasted pine that stood on the edge of an open space among the trees
BTS Both noses went down to the footprints in the snow
BTS Capital furnished the factory the machines and paid all the expenses
BTS You are travelling the same path that Bishop Morehouse is and toward a similar smash-up
BTS an' never once have I opened me lips but to say fine things iv them an' him God curse his soul an' may he rot in purgatory ten thousand years and then go down to the last an' deepest hell iv all
BTS It was our duty to sail the Ghost well to leeward of the last lee boat so that all the boats should have fair wind to run for us in case of squalls or threatening weather
BTS Brushing the ashes from his clothes he had resumed his conversation with Henderson
BTS This was doubly resented even triply resented
BTS So on this great journey into the East straight meat was the bill of fare ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless future
BTS They closed in upon her snarling and yelping and she was buried screaming with agony beneath the bristling mass of bodies
BTS One man cannot wrong another man
BTS But they saw up the trail and not down two men running with sled and dogs
BTS And then we quite forgot where we were leaving Wolf Larsen stranded and silent in the midst of our flood of gossip
BTS This seemed to satisfy his master who flung him down roughly in the bottom of the canoe
BTS There was wailing in the village where the women and children went without in order that what little they had might go into the bellies of the lean and hollow-eyed hunters who trod the forest in the vain pursuit of meat
BTS But it was jammed beneath the overturned sled and by the time Henry had helped him to right the load One Ear and the she-wolf were too close together and the distance too great to risk a shot
BTS Of course what it gave us in power we paid for in distance
BTS You see he went on as though addressing his neglected mother across half the girth of the earth each year I was going home
BTS Whatever was to be done I must do for myself
BTS He must have divined Wolf Larsen's trick and the sureness of detection for the light was at once dashed from my hand and the forecastle was left in darkness
BTS He never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush
BTS They are dead
BTS In fact the grey cub was not given to thinking at least to the kind of thinking customary of men
BTS No I answered and she questioned no further though I could have sworn her eyes retained for some time a mocking teasing expression
BTS Then it stands to reason that labor can consume only two billions
BTS I suppose Doctor you live in the mind
BTS But Wolf Larsen did not follow me up
BTS CHAPTER III THE GOD'S DOMAIN Not only was White Fang adaptable by nature but he had travelled much and knew the meaning and necessity of adjustment
BTS Aint got no spunk left
BTS I was confronted by the concrete
BTS Especially notable were the machinists
BTS Grey Beaver clouted White Fang alongside the head so that he cowered down close to the earth in respectful obedience
BTS he burst out at me with renewed rage
BTS The Appeal was desperate
BTS At my suggestion however he gave up smoking and drinking
BTS And it won't be a guess
BTS There was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance
BTS Before they saw the cause the two men saw him turn and start to run back toward them
BTS Then there will be huts to build and driftwood to gather
BTS After that he left that part of the country and journeyed over to the valley wherein he had been born
BTS Look at the states we've captured
BTS ha
BTS White Fang did not wait
BTS But I couldn't believe it
BTS This was something that dogs were not supposed to do
BTS You prefer to play atavistic roles
BTS So have I a wife and children he retorted
BTS You mean-- I began
BTS Their method was one of assertion assumption and denunciation
BTS Once the man pointed at him and White Fang snarled back as though the hand were just descending upon him instead of being as it was fifty feet away
BTS An' I don't want no boat-pullin' in mine
BTS They were men of affairs who took most active parts in industrial and political life
BTS It knows for certain more'n a self-respectin' wolf ought to know Henry agreed
BTS But outside the realm of business these men are stupid
BTS Furthermore he got over being awkward and self-conscious
BTS It was large for a wolf its gaunt frame advertising the lines of an animal that was among the largest of its kind
BTS It was their instinct
BTS He did it with great ostentation glancing significantly at me the while
BTS Lissen some dam fine day heem get mad lak hell an' den heem chew dat Spitz all up an' spit heem out on de snow
BTS With him came the first bull-dog that had ever entered the Klondike
BTS But this too quickly died down and ceased
BTS Listen to that we heard a soldier say
BTS And do not forget whenever a churchman does protest that he is discharged
BTS Ballingford winced and every eye glanced at his prodigious girth
BTS They cursed him and his fathers and mothers before him and all his seed to come after him down to the remotest generation and every hair on his body and drop of blood in his veins
BTS I asked
BTS Sling yer 'ook
BTS Henry queried
BTS You must accustom yourself to the fact that you are in another world than the one of oppression and brutality in which you have lived
BTS The jaw dropped the upper lip lifted and two rows of tobacco-discoloured teeth appeared
BTS It is true we elected fifty Congressmen
BTS It's not fair of you was her greeting
BTS He walked over to White Fang and began talking to him gently and soothingly
BTS As usual the watches below and the hunters turned out for what promised sport
BTS As clearly as in the light of past events he saw the defection of the favored unions the rise and the slow decay of the labor castes and the struggle between the decaying oligarchs and labor castes for control of the great governmental machine
BTS And she would probably be in San Francisco in five or six hours
BTS You mean
BTS One of the onlookers who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot speech now spoke up  It's not that I care a whoop what becomes of you but for the dogs' sakes I just want to tell you you can help them a mighty lot by breaking out that sled
BTS He was the only one that was cool and Ernest treated him with a respect he had not accorded the others
BTS He shook his head
BTS But White Fang was to have no more than a nightmare vision of the city an experience that was like a bad dream unreal and terrible that haunted him for long after in his dreams
BTS Then I experimented with the sail
BTS I was thunderstruck
BTS But just then the wrist I held leaped from my hand and the hand clasped like a steel trap about my wrist
BTS About the wolf you needn't write
BTS One white man having seen his dog a setter torn to pieces before his eyes drew a revolver
BTS Half a ton
BTS He had come to know quite thoroughly the world in which he lived
BTS Fair westerly breeze with a promise of stiffening if Louis predicts correctly
BTS He had no false sense of values
BTS He'll adjust himself all right
BTS The halyards slackened and though it all happened very quickly I could see them sag beneath the weight of his body
BTS yet he knew that here was horror and fled away from it in a panic
BTS Rebuttal was precisely similar
BTS Was the Church dumb then
BTS This meat he must not touch
BTS Both went down together but Mugridge alone arose
BTS When everybody was guilty how was anybody to be punished
BTS I grasped that I was in danger but that was all
BTS The she-wolf brought home meat
BTS It breathed of power
BTS She gave it up and I heard her scream in a way that cut me to the soul for it was a woman's scream of fear and heart-breaking despair
BTS Henry said the other munching with deliberation the beans he was eating did you happen to notice the way them dogs kicked up when I was a-feedin' 'em
BTS Not that he was so very large--he stood only five feet nine inches
BTS By this means he announced that he was prepared to retaliate for any hurt he might receive
BTS As the days went by Smoke's prophecy was verified
BTS Look at me
BTS They shook their heads and some one made a jocular remark which I did not catch but which raised a general laugh
BTS This editor who published patent medicine advertisements called me a scoundrelly demagogue because I dared him to print in his paper the truth about patent medicines
BTS In fact toward nightfall of the third day it increased a trifle and something more
BTS It must have spies in my employ and it must have access to the parties to all my contracts
BTS If you were a grocery trust for the whole United States you would be singing another song
BTS His whole demeanour every action was stamped with this purpose
BTS It seemed the breath of his nostrils this carrying his life in his hands and struggling for it against tremendous odds
BTS Prior to that death to me had been a theory
BTS Did you hear Mr
BTS The other lingered desperately for a moment and followed
BTS You remember I told you last night the barometer was falling
BTS Then everything went black before my eyes
BTS On the contrary she grew more excited and angry every moment until in the end White Fang flung dignity to the winds and frankly fled away from her across the fields
BTS But first I must say that his terrible diatribe had not touched them
BTS At other times I seriously contemplated suicide and the whole force of my hopeful philosophy was required to keep me from going over the side in the darkness of night
BTS No not that
BTS Mr
BTS And dreaming there by the Yukon bank with lazy eyes blinking at the fire these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his neck till he whimpered low and suppressedly or growled softly and the half-breed cook shouted at him Hey you Buck wake up
BTS I'll show 'em to you
BTS I can never forget the flaying he gave them at the end  This figure arises from the customs of the times
BTS The hunters were laughing at a fresh story of Smoke's
BTS It was impossible that the rest could be beyond these walls of grey
BTS This was beyond the scheme of the Iron Heel for the agents-provocateurs had done their work too well
BTS it will be called enforcing the law of the land that compels the laborers to work
BTS He had no conscious knowledge of death but like every animal of the Wild he possessed the instinct of death
BTS The young man did not want to give up his shoes and even offered to fight for them till he felt the horseshoer's strength in Ernest's hands
BTS This was not without its effect on White Fang
BTS The middle class owns twenty-four billions
BTS White Fang no longer hesitated
BTS They are the young bulls not old enough to have harems of their own
BTS The basic life of him dominated him again and his intelligence fled before the will of his flesh to live
BTS 'Twas after that I joined the Reds
BTS His muscles became hard as iron and he grew callous to all ordinary pain
BTS nor had Hans or Pete
BTS By God we will go clear
BTS But I was learning the sweet lesson for myself that the soul transmuted itself expressed itself through the flesh
BTS In the interest of meeting the other guests and what of my unfavorable impression I forgot all about the working-class philosopher though once or twice at table I noticed him--especially the twinkle in his eye as he listened to the talk first of one minister and then of another
BTS What is your name
BTS He has a hundred millions in the steel trust almost as much in a single western railway system half as much in a second and so on and on and on until the mind wearies of the cataloguing
BTS My vision is clear and far
BTS Was mine' you should have said not 'is mine
BTS White Fang watched him
BTS and twice for short periods we had been hove to
BTS Not only had this law been forcibly and many times impressed on him by his mother's nose and paw but in him the instinct of fear was developing
BTS Or perhaps who can tell
BTS It was just as well for there was worse to follow
BTS He was a sled-dog before Beauty Smith got hold of him
BTS Wolf Larsen was demanding
BTS yet it was a token of the fearless companionship with man that was ultimately to be his
BTS Matt took the rifle and began slowly to raise it to his shoulder
BTS Met him at the Bibelot once and he was telling us how he attempted to make a fire with a couple of sticks
BTS John Cunningham Avis Everhard's father was a professor at the State University at Berkeley California
BTS It seemed the machine-guns could not get started
BTS In fact the Iron Heel was preparing to make the abysmal beast roar
BTS The house is a mansion
BTS White Fang never raided a chicken-roost again
BTS Never in all his life had he been so vilely treated and never in all his life had he been so angry
BTS Pertonwaithe
BTS I noted Oofty-Oofty holding the end of a bandage and looking upon the scene his velvety and luminous eyes glistening in the light like a deer's eyes and yet I knew the barbaric devil that lurked in his breast and belied all the softness and tenderness almost womanly of his face and form
BTS and after that until I dozed I contented myself with trying to pierce the darkness to where I knew Maud crouched low in the stern-sheets watchful of the foaming sea and ready to call me on an instant's notice
BTS Maud queried loudly in the ear
BTS He tried to sniff noses with her but she retreated playfully and coyly
BTS He fired rapidly six times and six of the pack lay dead or dying another manifestation of power that sank deep into White Fang's consciousness
BTS the trusts have them both coming and going
BTS Both men were wounded and he was thrashing them both for having disobeyed his orders and crippled themselves in advance of the hunting season
BTS Ernest smilingly acquiesced
BTS Then sober thought came to me
BTS After that one of two things will happen either the Bishop will see the error of his way and return from his vacation a well man in whose eyes there are no more visions or else he will persist in his madness and then you may expect to see in the papers couched pathetically and tenderly the announcement of his insanity
BTS But love that was feverish and burning that was adoration that was madness it had taken John Thornton to arouse
BTS The small manufacturer is like the farmer
BTS Avis Everhard took for granted that her narrative would be read in her own day and so omits to mention the outcome of the trial for high treason
BTS They were sounds not made by his mate and yet they were remotely familiar
BTS He knew the law too well to take it out of Grey Beaver
BTS One of the potencies of whisky is the breeding of thirst
BTS And she was as direct as she was subtle
BTS To serve was to suffocate
BTS But I had decided that the part I was to play must be a neutral one so I did not answer
BTS You have convinced me of your sincerity she said with a faint smile
BTS I have here a poem that tells the whole story
BTS I am answered Ernest said quietly
BTS I asked
BTS She shook her head
BTS Of course no wireless stations had been blown up
BTS There had been no wrenching or jerking
BTS His comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied the work that killed it and recalled instances they had known where dogs too old for the toil or injured had died because they were cut out of the traces
BTS Maud I said
BTS Food and fire protection and companionship were some of the things he received from the god
BTS Will you please dress as warmly as you can at once and make into a bundle whatever you wish to bring with you
BTS the body of the lord and master was sacred not to be defiled by the teeth of such as he
BTS First comes the Plutocracy which is composed of wealthy bankers railway magnates corporation directors and trust magnates
BTS He was standing by the main rigging a few feet away from me
BTS In ways he was even greater than Ernest than whom I have known none greater
BTS he was reiterating at the top of his lungs
BTS White Fang did not need the encouragement
BTS and the question that had grown from the first in his eyes grew only the more imperative
BTS But he held out till camp was reached when his driver made a place for him by the fire
BTS Yes sir he answered with cheerful alacrity
BTS What do you think the Sierra Mills alone give him twenty thousand dollars a year for
BTS Hartman bent over and examined her
BTS Of the total number of persons engaged in occupations in the United States only nine-tenths of one per cent are from the Plutocracy yet the Plutocracy owns seventy per cent of the total wealth
BTS We'll keep him and give him an education
BTS There was no withstanding him
BTS We will say labor buys back two billions
BTS And to do them justice they honestly believed that the act was to be committed by the socialists
BTS I shall never forget the change in him when I mentioned Jackson's case
BTS Much I remembered possibly two-thirds of the quatrains and I managed to piece out the remainder without difficulty
BTS Young man you have dreamed all this
BTS The table was angry now fighting angry
BTS Johnson looked at me and I could see that his face was worn and haggard
BTS But that is beside the matter I cried
BTS And to love and to wait and win love that surely was glorious enough for me
BTS and amidst the general crumble of prices the price of labor crumbled fastest of all
BTS If I raised never a hand for that poor fool pointing astern to the tiny sail d'ye think I'm hungerin' for a broken head for a woman I never laid me eyes upon before this day
BTS I made no reply
BTS They travelled on without speech saving their breath for the work of their bodies
BTS And still the bull-dog with grim certitude toiled after him
BTS I got hold of Percy Layton
BTS And in the meantime they made preparation for the general strike
BTS They were all too soft dying under the toil the frost and starvation
BTS White Fang however was beginning to tolerate this act
BTS She nodded her head that she heard and I noted in her face the signs of the same sickness at sight or sound of violent struggle from which I had suffered so severely during my first weeks on the Ghost
BTS He's the boy'll fix 'em
BTS That wolf's a dog an' it's eaten fish many's the time from the hand of man
BTS Its coat was the true wolf-coat
BTS I knew you on the instant
BTS I cried aloud in awful fear a wild inarticulate cry
BTS This was a sort of victory for Thomas Mugridge and enabled him to accept more gracefully the defeat I had given him though of course he was too discreet to attempt to drive the hunters away
BTS It is my phrase too I said stubbornly
BTS They as a class believed that they alone maintained civilization
BTS Boost him along and I'll promote you to his place and he's getting forty-five dollars a month
BTS There they are
BTS I do not care to remember
BTS It savoured of the trap of bondage
BTS You've merely got a foretaste of the Iron Heel
BTS Ernest's arm about me was eloquent with love
BTS It was a strange meeting
BTS Then I removed the sprit tightly hauling down the peak of the sail and we raced along under what sailors call a leg-of-mutton
BTS But it was an illusion
BTS Again he awakened a little later though it seemed hours to him
BTS His development was in the direction of power
BTS But everything was grist to the Iron Heel
BTS The rise of this vote clearly indicates the swift growth of the party of revolution
BTS No
BTS But he had not yet grown compact
BTS He has held me in his arms and I mere I have filled that mind of his to the exclusion of all his multitudinous and kingly thoughts
BTS He was never known to lose his footing
BTS I'll tell you
BTS He is my dog
BTS Major staggered to his feet but the blood spouting from his throat reddened the snow in a widening path
BTS Gawd blime me if you ayn't a slob
BTS I strain my ears and all my senses for some betrayal of that impending storm
BTS But they'll work
BTS Mercedes screamed
BTS In Avis Everhard's words they could literally make a man over
BTS the rest of the team was strung out ahead single file to the leader which position was filled by Spitz
BTS One string he tied around the throat of Kiche
BTS With the exception of several bad wounds the rest were merely severe bruises and lacerations
BTS The suddenness of his outburst startled and frightened me
BTS The three disloyal regiments had been destroyed in the fortresses to the last man
BTS It was an avalanche of fury that Johnson strove vainly to fend off
BTS But had she seen the clamour in them and understood
BTS But I blocked his path and did not offer to move
BTS The stout gentleman is stuffing the magazine into his overcoat pocket and looking on curiously
BTS and now you are in Grange politics
BTS Through these the tiny stream had cut its deep and precipitous channel
BTS I can readily understand she began that this morning's affair was largely an accident
BTS No you are too cunning for that
BTS At last he arose in a weary manner as though all the resilience had gone out of his body and proceeded to fasten the dogs to the sled
BTS I had hoped better things of you Hump
BTS But the boss doesn't know that she added quickly betraying a fear of getting him into trouble
BTS Somewhere a boot thumped loudly and at irregular intervals against the wall
BTS Young Wickson never wavered in his loyalty to the Cause
BTS Not by reasoning not by the five senses alone but by other and remoter and uncharted senses came the feeling to White Fang that the man was ominous with evil pregnant with hurtfulness and therefore a thing bad and wisely to be hated
BTS It was my task to tally the pelts as they came aboard from the boats to oversee the skinning and afterward the cleansing of the decks and bringing things ship-shape again
BTS I asked
BTS Why should you
BTS Nor did I ever have a headache except the time my head was healing after having been laid open for six inches by a capstan-bar
BTS Maud's condition was pitiable
BTS He was one of many at dinner and in the drawing-room where we gathered and waited for all to arrive he made a rather incongruous appearance
BTS Beyond its foaming base lay the pretty villages of the Japanese colonists and smiling valleys which penetrated deep into the interior
BTS And White Fang just as bitterly hated them back
BTS Get up there
BTS Rest be blanked said Hal with his beardless lips
BTS As by magic forty thousand soldiers of the regular army surrounded the malcontents
BTS But with the other foreman I had better luck
BTS They are more like children to him even the hunters and as children he treats them descending perforce to their level and playing with them as a man plays with puppies
BTS 'Ow I 'ate 'im
BTS Show the fallacy Colonel Van Gilbert
BTS O'Connor and the others nodded their heads
BTS Now that he is dead I am free to speak
BTS He took a step into the ring and pointed his finger at White Fang
BTS The single block of my original shears-tackle I had attached to the end of the boom
BTS After the simple breakfast capped with a cup of cold water Maud took her lesson in steering
BTS Then it seemed as though I were being dragged over rasping sands white and hot in the sun
BTS Didn't he kill his boat-steerer last year
BTS A little thing truly but when multiplied by the thousand ingenious devices of such a mind the mental state of the men in the forecastle may be slightly comprehended
BTS It was as bold as his eyes
BTS She should sleep
BTS He fell to the floor half stunned for the moment breathing heavily and blinking his eyes in a stupid sort of way
BTS And every day thereafter found him out and ranging a wider area
BTS The Wall Street Journal a stock gamesters' publication in commenting upon Lord Avebury's speech said These words were spoken by an aristocrat and a member of the most conservative body in all Europe
BTS he shouted back
BTS In this manner had fought forgotten ancestors
BTS Yet he quickly worked it out that all of them belonged to the master
BTS Bah
BTS Then came the Milk Trust
BTS Reference is here made of course not to the oath of Smith but to the verb ripped used by Avis Everhard
BTS It to-day makes the laws for it owns the Senate Congress the courts and the state legislatures
BTS And whom have I to thank for this kindness
BTS Generation by generation down all the generations had this fear of the Wild been stamped into their natures
BTS An if I get a chance at it that wolf that's a dog'll be jes' meat Bill declared
BTS He was very much alive very happy and very proud of himself
BTS He apprehended clearly his danger
BTS How I went over I do not know though I did know and instantly why those in the water were so desirous of getting back on the steamer
BTS Nevertheless he made out sheltering between her legs against the length of her body five strange little bundles of life very feeble very helpless making tiny whimpering noises with eyes that did not open to the light
BTS The general strike was the one great victory we American socialists won
BTS Whereupon he leaned his head on his hands and wept
BTS Powerfully muscled though some of them were there had been something wrong with all of them an insufficient development here an undue development there a twist or a crook that destroyed symmetry legs too short or too long or too much sinew or bone exposed or too little
BTS We'll see to that Wolf Larsen answered and elevated his voice in a call of Cooky
BTS You have forgotten the editors
BTS and not only that for his features as human features at all were unrecognizable so discoloured and swollen had they become in the few minutes which had elapsed between the beginning of the beating and the dragging forward of the body
BTS Oh he'll heave to in a little while and pick them up I answered cheerfully
BTS Composed of men and women actuated by lofty purpose and unafraid to die the Fighting Groups exercised tremendous influence and tempered the savage brutality of the rulers
BTS Dazed suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue with the life half throttled out of him Buck attempted to face his tormentors
BTS White Fang who had never known sickness in his life became sick
BTS But Hartman was cool and was giving the proper passwords
BTS He has delivered his message Ernest cried
BTS By the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice Buck was played out
BTS But there is I objected
BTS and it was they in turn that later became that terrible weapon of the Oligarchy the agents- provocateurs
BTS I stopped obediently in my walk toward the galley
BTS Maud clapped her hands the instant she was relieved from holding the turn crying It works
BTS It was fifty-two years in the building during which time a permanent army of half a million serfs was employed
BTS It did happen to see the light in a newspaper I replied but not because the magazine editors had been denied a glimpse at it
BTS Here was little chance for swimming
BTS He knew the law of forage
BTS When he was made the mould was broke said Pete
BTS I spread before me a wrinkled letter written to me by Ernest twenty years ago and from it I copy the following Your father is a member of the Philomath so you are able to come
BTS Thornton was himself bruised and battered and he went carefully over Buck's body when he had been brought around finding three broken ribs
BTS A madness comes up in my brain even now as I think of it
BTS To-day she was examined by the regular insanity experts
BTS Membership in these unions will become like seats in Paradise
BTS One would conclude from this that under a capable management of society modern civilized man would be a great deal better off than the cave-man
BTS You've forfeited your rights to own that dog was the rejoinder
BTS In the afternoon he blundered upon a ptarmigan
BTS It's a wolf and there's no taming it Weedon Scott announced
BTS He was squatting down on his heels face to face with White Fang and petting him rubbing at the roots of the ears making long caressing strokes down the neck to the shoulders tapping the spine gently with the balls of his fingers
BTS The fourth engineer and the three oilers after a warm interview with Wolf Larsen were furnished with outfits from the slop-chests assigned places under the hunters in the various boats and watches on the vessel and bundled forward into the forecastle
BTS The doorways to all the buildings were closed
BTS For centuries no hint of its existence reached the world
BTS But worse than all this was the atmosphere in which he lived
BTS Nor were any looks being exchanged
BTS When did you last write to her
BTS Carelessness
BTS His puppyhood and the instinct of submission took charge of him
BTS This is my father's land and-- But at that moment Biedenbach every polite and gentle said from behind him in a low voice Hands up my young sir
BTS They were competitive beasts
BTS By that I take it you see something that is alive but that necessarily does not have to live for ever
BTS Charles was a middle-aged lightish-colored man with weak and watery eyes and a mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up giving the lie to the limply drooping lip it concealed
BTS but he's my sailor when I have him aboard and I'll do what I damn well please with him
BTS She sank her fangs into her mate's shoulder in reproof
BTS It's dead safe
BTS But think Humphrey a fellow-creature in his last lonely hour
BTS The hunters left the table and went on deck and still we talked
BTS Weedon Scott pondered for a moment
BTS And well he might be eighty feet above the deck to trust himself on those thin and jerking ropes
BTS For behind any wish of theirs was power to enforce that wish power that hurt power that expressed itself in clouts and clubs in flying stones and stinging lashes of whips
BTS His paper will always circulate at par
BTS I asked Peter Donnelly one of the foremen who had testified at the trial
BTS Themselves they had covered twelve hundred miles with two days' rest and in the nature of reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing
BTS The sight of him made me doubly angry
BTS From shoulder to wrist of the crossed arms the coat-sleeve blue flannel shirt and undershirt were ripped in rags while the arms themselves were terribly slashed and streaming blood
BTS Sick as he was Dave resented being taken out grunting and growling while the traces were unfastened and whimpering broken-heartedly when he saw Sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long
BTS yet White Fang learned to face them fiercely belligerent and unafraid
BTS To destroy Hearst all that was necessary was to take away from him his advertising
BTS The fresh breeze was blowing right down upon us and I could hear the whistle plainly off to one side and a little ahead
BTS Couldn't see the necessity for it nor the common sense
BTS so you see my dear your father's street-arab career is beset with disappointments
BTS But no harm came of it nor of the embrace from the strange man-god that followed
BTS You pompously call yourselves Republicans and Democrats
BTS He is not accustomed to the presence of ladies anyway
BTS Mugridge was sleepily spluttering that he was a gentleman's son
BTS It was by strong effort only that I was able to maintain my old identity
BTS and nothing happened
BTS Not alone out of his own eyes but out of the eyes of all his ancestors was the cub now looking upon man out of eyes that had circled in the darkness around countless winter camp-fires that had peered from safe distances and from the hearts of thickets at the strange two-legged animal that was lord over living things
BTS Anything to say
BTS She snorted and tried to scramble away
BTS At the trial and still with honest belief several testified to having seen Ernest prepare to throw the bomb and that it exploded prematurely
BTS He had lain so long that his muscles had lost their cunning and all the strength had gone out of them
BTS A shrill little whistle piping as if gone mad came from directly ahead and from very near at hand
BTS She sprang savagely at the thing that had hurt her
BTS Every muscle every fibre every cell was tired dead tired
BTS she asked gaily
BTS Bound by bound he gained
BTS High in the air and straight up soared the shape of white now a struggling snowshoe rabbit that leaped and bounded executing a fantastic dance there above him in the air and never once returning to earth
BTS We've paid for our experience in sweat and blood and we've earned all that's coming to us was the reply
BTS His hind-legs still rested on the cave-lip so he fell forward head downward
BTS And under their direction and generously rewarded will toil the artists
BTS For that matter life and footing were synonymous in this unending warfare with the pack and none knew it better than White Fang
BTS Then you don't believe in altruism
BTS the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining eager ambitious creatures
BTS Ah we were very close together in that moment
BTS A lowering of selling price to cost and even to less than cost
BTS A rookery
BTS I lifted the end of the hatch cover and the canvas-shrouded body slipped feet first into the sea
BTS All this and more a whole world of chaos and wreck in possibly fifteen seconds I had seen and heard and grasped
BTS And on the porch before the delighted family Judge Scott face to face with White Fang said slowly and solemnly sixteen times White Fang you are smarter than I thought
BTS Pardon me
BTS This is Endeavour Island I said
BTS It was a harness store we found ourselves in and he fixed me up a couch of horse blankets in the private office well to the rear
BTS and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle
BTS Bill threw on more wood before lighting his pipe
BTS I heard Maud scream
BTS It was all well enough in the Southland under the law of love and fellowship to respect private property and personal feelings
BTS They ran many miles that day
BTS My hands were full with the flying-jib jib and staysail
BTS When summer came on he elected to sweat out a hot and dusty existence in the city and to toil incessantly
BTS He did not know why but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of impending calamity
BTS The next moment similar sheets of flame and smoke smote the front of the building across the street opposite it
BTS I rose to a climax of enthusiasm and worship and before he could guess my intention threw my arms around his neck and kissed him on the lips
BTS I made no charges against the men with whom I had talked nor for that matter did I even mention them
BTS Oh Lord
BTS He plunged about in their very midst tearing rending destroying in constant and terrific motion which defied the arrows they discharged at him
BTS It has not been kind of you
BTS I told him all that had taken place
BTS He sniffed it curiously then licked some up on his tongue
BTS He sat on the step of his cabin and stared at the dog-musher who responded with a shrug that was equally hopeless
BTS Those who were executed went to their deaths with all the gladness of martyrs
BTS No sir
BTS His great chest was low to the ground his head forward and down while his feet were flying like mad the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in parallel grooves
BTS Thus we learned which building was held by our comrades and they did good work saving those in the street from the bombs of the enemy
BTS Yes Matt went on I know you've tried to but you didn't take a club
BTS But the comrades had no chance
BTS As for ourselves not one of us knew how the bomb was thrown
BTS By this time he had become the centre of interest
BTS He passed me the signals of the Iron Heel's secret service in token that he too was in its employ
BTS and high ideals
BTS Henry asked
BTS I looked and saw that the sleeve was empty
BTS One at a time he repeated softly
BTS He turned and fled away not from the hurt of the fire but from the laughter that sank even deeper and hurt in the spirit of him
BTS This was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward pell-mell crowded together blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey
BTS I know that the Church has lost the--what you call the proletariat
BTS A thought struck me
BTS There you are
BTS Never mind the preamble
BTS By means of deck-tackles I had arranged to carry the halyards forward to the windlass
BTS I myself do not write untruthful things
BTS Please please she said oh so softly
BTS Then get in here and break this grip
BTS But how
BTS But death in its more sordid and terrible aspects was a thing with which I had been unacquainted till now
BTS T'ree vair' good dogs Francois told Perrault
BTS The human had to pass through those stages in its rise from the mire and slime of low organic life
BTS Only one sister remained to him
BTS One foot was descending into the opening while the other foot was just on the verge of beginning the uplift
BTS A quick effort brought his hands up to the halyards again
BTS They were guilty of torturing their prisoners to death
BTS I could almost believe in God
BTS Is this not so
BTS But he resolutely held the door of his tepee inside which he had placed the culprit and refused to permit the vengeance for which his tribespeople clamoured
BTS Life flowed past him deep and wide and varied continually impinging upon his senses demanding of him instant and endless adjustments and correspondences and compelling him almost always to suppress his natural impulses
BTS Further there was the need of seeing the captain about what arrangements could be made for getting me ashore
BTS When I finished he had me read it over a second time and a third
BTS The repeated drenchings in the icy water had likewise had their effect on him
BTS and this combined with the violent movement of the ship as she struggled through the storm would surely have made me sea-sick had I been a victim to that malady
BTS I stepped back separating from her and replaced the knife in its sheath
BTS The number of the assailants was a cause of confusion
BTS But this love did not come in a day
BTS He has never been answered
BTS Yet of the trap and of bondage he knew nothing
BTS White Fang bristled and snarled and snapped in the face of the open-mouthed oncoming wave of dogs and went down and under them feeling the sharp slash of teeth in his body himself biting and tearing at the legs and bellies above him
BTS Judge Miller's place it was called
BTS And yet I wrestled with myself and could not pull the triggers
BTS It no longer required an effort of the vision to see them
BTS There is room for argument there Wickson muttered
BTS He is a free spirit
BTS He made it
BTS Neither do they
BTS And what is the meaning of that in turn
BTS Just precisely what do you mean when you call us metaphysicians
BTS And ever I loved Maud with an increasing love
BTS In the rays of the lantern I could see his perplexed face peering down
BTS And when they came to close quarters and he had been beaten back by the club he went on growling and snarling and showing his fangs
BTS He must have known somehow that we were on board for he said Good-morning very confidently and waited for the greeting to be returned
BTS Table and bunk were littered with designs and calculations
BTS I do not care to think of it
BTS It's good coffee too I know
BTS My eyes had spoken I knew until I had found the culprits out and silenced them
BTS Their innate sense of right has been violated Maud Brewster said joining the conversation
BTS This ridiculous picture well illustrates the heartless conduct of the masters
BTS And upon me was that old sickness at the pit of the stomach caused always by the spectacle of physical violence
BTS It possessed many possibilities was capable of being moulded into many different forms
BTS Burton struck out without warning straight from the shoulder
BTS He received six months' imprisonment for contempt of court in disobeying the injunctions while he was bankrupted by countless damage suits
BTS Buck's marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead
BTS From out of the fog came the mournful tolling of a bell and I could see the pilot turning the wheel with great rapidity
BTS His mouth was stern and his eyes too
BTS He was yet to learn that for size and weight the weasel was the most ferocious vindictive and terrible of all the killers of the Wild
BTS I think that he is a better man than you are I answered impelled somehow with a desire to draw upon myself a portion of the wrath I felt was about to break upon his head
BTS When they called he came
BTS and while I pulled the flying-jib and staysail split their cloths apart and thundered into nothingness
BTS Furthermore little children went to work on the machine-looms at lower wages and displaced the men
BTS There seemed something missing in my environment
BTS What took them possibly two minutes took me twenty but in the end I succeeded in setting and trimming it and with the steering-oar in my hands hauled on the wind
BTS Well the Iron Heel has defeated the labor unions on the industrial field and driven them over to the political field
BTS It was not the first time in his long and successful life that this thing had happened
BTS Also White Fang had early come to differentiate between the family and the servants of the household
BTS Now the Philomath Club was the most select on the Pacific Coast
BTS White Fang whined as he watched the operation
BTS and they believed it firmly believed it
BTS while Dave who was an experienced wheeler nipped Buck's hind quarters whenever he was in error
BTS It touched the ends of his upstanding hair
BTS But Ernest was merciless
BTS G'wan you Kelly
BTS Civilized he could have died for a moral consideration say the defence of Judge Miller's riding-whip
BTS One can feel the loom of them--things vast vague and terrible
BTS Schooner-man
BTS On the instant the she-wolf's coyness and playfulness disappeared
BTS But I'd do more than that to get a chance at the Philomaths
BTS The millions of the discontented and the impoverished are ours the socialists said
BTS Riot arson and wanton destruction of property was their function and well they performed it
BTS While running away from the wind I had not appreciated its force but when we ceased to run I learned to my sorrow and well-nigh to my despair how fiercely it was really blowing
BTS With you socialists to back us we'll make them sing another song when we take office
BTS It was now dynamic--a fascinating spectacle of dread
BTS But whatever he does he does because he desires to do it
BTS he demanded
BTS There buzzing in the air at the tip of his nose was a lone mosquito
BTS The resulting action was a compromise
BTS CHAPTER XI THE GREAT ADVENTURE Mr
BTS The automobile drew up at a railroad station
BTS When running more freely with the wind astern abeam or on the quarter it will be necessary for me to steer
BTS Though the cook had a cubby-hole of a state-room opening off from the cabin in the cabin itself he had never dared to linger or to be seen and he flitted to and fro once or twice a day a timid spectre
BTS I'm sorry sir
BTS The two men looked at each other
BTS She took after him never ceasing her outcry
BTS So the grey cub knew fear though he knew not the stuff of which fear was made
BTS Life was stirring
BTS It was the growl of the pack mouthed by the pack and mouthed in all unconsciousness
BTS I waved my hand to him and he answered the greeting but with a wave that was hopeless and despairing
BTS Once it tottered about to fall back but the broken hold was regained and it still went up
BTS Send a man to the wheel Mr
BTS He hated the very wood of the pen that confined him
BTS Shouts of applause went up for the victor and there were many cries of Cherokee
BTS They quickly learned to leave him alone neither venturing hostile acts nor making overtures of friendliness
BTS There was life abroad in it different from the life which had been there throughout the summer
BTS Through them the socialist leaders of both countries presented their ultimatum to the rulers
BTS Dick on the porch growled and White Fang on the steps bristled and growled back
BTS Ostensibly an oligarch until his death he was in reality one of the most valuable of our agents
BTS The time had come
BTS He was very nervous as he sat on the platform and I could see the high tension he was under
BTS Yet it was if anything worse than ever
BTS We were all seated when Miss Brentwood brought Ernest in
BTS Hammerfield and Dr
BTS Desperate times give need for desperate remedies and the surgeons of the Revolution rose to the need
BTS The mate knows that and you know it sir
BTS And always he checked them back to facts
BTS Down sir
BTS His eyes were wide and staring
BTS He was obeying the will of the gods
BTS The expropriators are expropriated
BTS But she divined the mockery in Wolf Larsen's words and again favoured me with a sympathetic glance
BTS Me only friend is the company
BTS For as many of itself as were killed it killed that many of the enemy
BTS My contribution was canned beef fried with crumbled sea-biscuit and water
BTS He could not immediately forego his wild heritage and his memories of the Wild
BTS She had such faith in me
BTS He's untamable
BTS Sometimes when a soft southland dog went down shrieking its death-cry under the fangs of the pack this man would be unable to contain himself and would leap into the air and cry out with delight
BTS To-day the Plutocracy makes the law and to enforce the law it has at its beck and call the police the army the navy and lastly the militia which is you and me and all of us
BTS and every minute or so the group of hunters gave mouth to a laughter that sounded to me like a wolf-chorus or the barking of hell-hounds
BTS We have not forgotten the deeds of our forefathers
BTS He sank his tiny teeth into one of the wings and pulled and tugged sturdily
BTS To the north and not far away a group of naked rocks thrust above the sea on one of which I could distinguish a lighthouse
BTS Ernest called it the dinner of the Machine Breakers
BTS Often were we betrayed
BTS As soon as death had thinned the jam Garthwaite still grasping my arm led a rush of survivors into the wide entrance of an office building
BTS White Fang's was a service of duty and awe but not of love
BTS When he remembered locality it was too late
BTS As I stood there hesitant I heard her cry softly Oh Humphrey I am lost
BTS But still I refused to believe
BTS Your teeth are pulled gentlemen
BTS This then is our answer
BTS They set their faces against the war
BTS Van Weyden keep this course for the present and you might as well set the watches for we won't do any lingering to-night
BTS It is not strange an Indian was saying
BTS One kiss dear love I whispered
BTS Also I am suffering from boils due to the diet most likely for I was never afflicted in this manner before
BTS All your experience of men and things is worthless here
BTS You hardly realize sir that I am not a man or that I am unaccustomed to the vagrant careless life which you and your men seem to lead
BTS I think nothing but iv my own skin these days was his answer
BTS Not that he was calling upon God
BTS So it was you was it you black beggar
BTS Another time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge and amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a long-barrelled flint-lock
BTS At the sight of him as he came out of the cabin they sprang upon him
BTS And the sun is gone she said her eyes still fixed upon our island where we had proved our mastery over matter and attained to the truest comradeship that may fall to man and woman
BTS It was borne in upon him that he must let his master's dogs alone
BTS But he's liable to any moment Scott answered
BTS I noticed the lips slightly move Maud said
BTS They are so tied by their human nature that they can't do a thing unless they think it is right
BTS Go on go on I pray you
BTS he had a fine pride in himself was even a trifle egotistical as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation
BTS So all hesitancy vanished and the pair descended into the cabin
BTS At a political meeting of the socialists where many reporters were present father saw his chance
BTS Again I went below
BTS As usual Maud held the turn while I heaved
BTS I shall probably scream
BTS On the other hand there were the fox terriers a score of them at least who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops
BTS He had outgrown his mother
BTS It was the mandate of his instinct that that head must be free
BTS and when he could not appease his hunger he had felt restriction
BTS Very often
BTS She dropped in alongside by him as though it were her appointed position and took the pace of the pack
BTS Not that he did this consciously however
BTS I'll have to cheer him up to-morrow
BTS It was horrible
BTS And there was need for it
BTS but ever afterward death has been a simple fact that does not matter it is so easy
BTS He sprang into the water and swam after it deaf to the sharp cries of Grey Beaver to return
BTS and why should I not fill my eyes with that which pleases me
BTS Ernest looked at me intently for a moment then went on
BTS It is a shame I heard Johnson growling in painfully slow and correct English
BTS He caught Cherokee with head turned away as he whirled more slowly
BTS Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me
BTS After breakfast next morning when I had hoisted Wolf Larsen's body on deck ready for burial it was still blowing heavily and a large sea was running
BTS He spoke carelessly enough but there was real fear behind the speech
BTS Matt helped the man to his feet
BTS CHAPTER II THE SHE-WOLF Breakfast eaten and the slim camp-outfit lashed to the sled the men turned their backs on the cheery fire and launched out into the darkness
BTS Well where's all hands
BTS Oh yes you are the other assured him
BTS It is an old trick old as the class struggle is old--stealing the captains from the army of labor
BTS The land itself was a desolation lifeless without movement so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness
BTS The capture of the world-market by the United States had disrupted the rest of the world
BTS And still remain the surpluses
BTS I ain't seen a rabbit sign for days
BTS Then I shall smile no more he said calmly
BTS It happened in an instant
BTS The coming of Maud Brewster into my life seemed to have transformed me
BTS And this strange vessel with its terrible men pressed under by wind and sea and ever leaping up and out was heading away into the south-west into the great and lonely Pacific expanse
BTS My heart stole back across wide wastes of years To One who wandered by a lonely sea
BTS He was warmly followed by a number of the others and the cry of all was to destroy the trusts
BTS White Fang could scarcely realise that he was free
BTS He shook his fist angrily at the gleaming eyes and began securely to prop his moccasins before the fire
BTS He darted in low and closed with his fangs
BTS I ain't feelin' special enthusiastic Bill persisted
BTS And then step by step hand and foot he slowly struggled up the ladder
BTS The Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers' Association and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club on the memorable night of Manuel's treachery
BTS In the cabin I found all hands assembled sailors as well and while coffee was being cooked over the small stove we drank whisky and crunched hard-tack
BTS Stow that
BTS Again the whole table agreed with Ernest
BTS Yes eighty-three
BTS John D
BTS Don't I remember him in Hakodate two years gone when he had a row an' shot four iv his men
BTS all markets were falling
BTS Suddenly from the cabin came a great choking bellow followed by all the sounds of a furious struggle
BTS Several times Wolf Larsen tried to inveigle me into discussion but I gave him short answers and eluded him
BTS But he had yet to learn the remarkable quickness of White Fang who struck with the certainty and swiftness of a coiled snake
BTS no eighty-two eh
BTS Hal drew his long hunting-knife
BTS Each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty miles
BTS And all the while I sat in a half-daze the drunken riot of the steerage breaking through the bulkhead the man I feared and the woman I loved talking on and on
BTS Also I carried the dirk in a sheath at my hip sailor-fashion and maintained toward Thomas Mugridge a constant attitude which was composed of equal parts of domineering insult and contempt
BTS The name only and not the idea was imported from Russia
BTS He still pressed his left hand against his forehead
BTS Yes I said defiantly and honestly I am afraid
BTS A pause seemed to fall
BTS he queried a short while after
BTS Once the sled broke through with Dave and Buck and they were half-frozen and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out
BTS White Fang slunk into camp one evening and dropped down with a sigh of content
BTS There was nothing pretty about it nothing divine only two cowardly moving things that sat whetting steel upon stone and a group of other moving things cowardly and otherwise that looked on
BTS We had been so long upon the moving rocking sea that the stable land was a shock to us
BTS White Fang was in splendid condition
BTS Colonel Van Gilbert was subtly facetious in his introduction of the social reformer and member of the working class and the audience smiled
BTS He even ventured to raise his fist to me but I was becoming animal-like myself and I snarled in his face so terribly that it must have frightened him back
BTS Think not
BTS Walking right along
BTS Chapter V
BTS I'll show you something that isn't a dream then Ernest answered
BTS Death Larsen is in command of the only sealing steamer in the fleet the Macedonia which carries fourteen boats whereas the rest of the schooners carry only six
BTS Everything was swimming before my eyes and I turned sick
BTS There was one strange thing about this wall of light
BTS Then at twilight came John Carlson who demanded Wickson's shoes
BTS In the darkness I almost embraced Biedenbach who came down first
BTS Of course there wasn't any mortgage and never had been any mortgage
BTS But it would seem that it was aimed against you too
BTS He swallowed again and cleared his throat
BTS See if you don't
BTS but it was quite a different matter for a lone wolf to encounter a lynx especially when the lynx was known to have a litter of hungry kittens at her back
BTS What can you do
BTS Every animal was motionless as though turned to stone
BTS But this was not to be all
BTS Ever in his ears was sounding her sharp and nervous snarl
BTS Our boasted civilization is based upon blood soaked in blood and neither you nor I nor any of us can escape the scarlet stain
BTS He missed the snow without being aware of it
BTS He got me all right he announced pointing to the torn trousers and undercloths and the growing stain of red
BTS He threw one arm down to protect the stomach the other arm up to protect the head
BTS Beast
BTS Almighty God when I drain life's glass Of all its rainbow gleams The hapless plight of eternal night Shall be none too long for my dreams
BTS I here give the fragment not alone because he loved it but because it epitomized the paradox that he was in the spirit of him and his conception of his spirit
BTS Yet we learned that we were not the first who had landed on Endeavour Island
BTS What does he do
BTS And all his life he sang the song of man
BTS Eighty feet beneath I could see the agonized strain of his muscles as he gripped for very life
BTS Then he crawled back into the blankets
BTS I sniffed
BTS Without adventure we crossed the United States to California
BTS I know
BTS Then she assumed a rueful expression
BTS I did not know how to shoot but I proceeded to learn
BTS Gawd
BTS He was worried and apprehensive yet the camp lured his mate and she was loath to depart
BTS I am almost sure of it
BTS And then one night he escaped
BTS How could it be otherwise
BTS But you ought to know quite closely
BTS Give me an intellectual answer to my intellectual charge that the capitalist class has mismanaged society
BTS of my brothers who went away one by one to the deep-sea farming and never came back
BTS You are not going to
BTS They stopped by a running stream to drink and stopping Buck remembered John Thornton
BTS Garthwaite and I bore charmed lives
BTS Pish
BTS Beauty Smith was frightened and angry
BTS He drew up his legs and the man-eater seemed no more than barely to touch one foot sinking back into the water with a splash
BTS Then it was clear to me some one else had worked and made them and been robbed of them
BTS Many of them he could whip in single fight
BTS But the Mercenaries were not content with what they had done
BTS There was no warning only a leap in like a flash a metallic clip of teeth a leap out equally swift and Curly's face was ripped open from eye to jaw
BTS I said
BTS In the Northland the only domesticated animal was the dog
BTS he asked
BTS They're wrong all wrong of course and contrary to reason
BTS And to cap it all that cap
BTS Not that Cherokee was slow
BTS The next moment she was at his throat her teeth buried in his hair and flesh
BTS I queried in a whisper
BTS So it was when we moved to San Francisco into four wretched rooms in the slum south of Market Street that he embarked upon the adventure with the joy and enthusiasm of a child--combined with the clear sight and mental grasp of an extraordinary intellect
BTS Smoke ho
BTS You do not know the real world in which you live and your thinking has no place in the real world except in so far as it is phenomena of mental aberration
BTS They've blown up the mains
BTS They should carry out your plan with expedition
BTS By night it was dead calm and I was toiling once more at the oars but weakly most weakly
BTS Several times they encountered solitary wolves
BTS He looked along the airy path he must traverse and then down to the deck
BTS Asmunsen the owner of a large granite quarry in Contra Costa County
BTS Wind's in wrong direction
BTS All things come alike to all
BTS For my mind had leaped to a star-cool altitude and grasped a passionless transvaluation of values
BTS Ain't bleedin' much Matt announced
BTS The cursing policeman alongside of me also ran and Hartman and I ran too we knew not why obsessed with the same blind terror to get away from that particular spot
BTS But he reassured himself with a glance down at his host a big man himself but dwarfed by the propinquity of the giant
BTS This because he considered that they were likewise possessions of the master
BTS and for two days and nights Buck neither ate nor drank
BTS But the haunting familiarity of those shoulders and that silver hair
BTS What's right got to do with it
BTS I gat me men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and that of all sorts
BTS Hard up there
BTS White Fang had seen the camp-dogs toiling in the harness so that he did not resent overmuch the first placing of the harness upon himself
BTS When he was rolled on his side he ceased to growl when the fingers pressed and prodded at the base of his ears the pleasurable sensation increased
BTS These great works will be the form their expenditure of the surplus will take and in the same way that the ruling classes of Egypt of long ago expended the surplus they robbed from the people by the building of temples and pyramids
BTS I caught her in time to save her from falling and helped her to a seat on the cabin
BTS It was sitting on a log not a foot beyond the end of his nose
BTS he demanded
BTS This was evidently Wolf Larsen's quest to find the men who appeared to be asleep and who were not asleep or who had not been asleep very recently
BTS And if he interferes  But I dare not stay ashore all night alone Maud was saying when I came back to myself
BTS The cry in all Asia was Asia for the Asiatics
BTS I likened him to some great tiger a beast of prowess and prey
BTS 4 the Gould family railway interests
BTS Once and unwitting that he did so or that I saw he laughed aloud mockingly and defiantly at the advancing storm
BTS And how my hatred for him grew and grew during that fearful time to cyclopean dimensions
BTS And as I looked the thought came to me that in that rushing stream of human lava were men comrades and heroes whose mission had been to rouse the abysmal beast and to keep the enemy occupied in coping with it
BTS And you know me as I am generally known
BTS It was patent that our comrades were in one building that Mercenaries were in the other and that they were fighting across the street
BTS I was feeling sick and squeamish and sat down on a bench
BTS He was glad for one thing the rope was off his neck
BTS I am not
BTS He would lie in a screen of bushes watching for a squirrel to venture far enough out on the ground from its tree-refuge
BTS What value
BTS I shot it out of the pack in a moose pasture over on Little Stick
BTS I remembered Michelet's To man woman is as the earth was to her legendary son
BTS but as the men continued to pull lustily they struck closer and closer
BTS It's just like home-coming Maud said as I ran the boat ashore
BTS We would keep Philip Wickson a prisoner and educate him in our ethics and sociology
BTS So what was the good to write
BTS What else did you run across
BTS Any sacrifice that makes me lose one crawl or squirm is foolish and not only foolish for it is a wrong against myself and a wicked thing
BTS It seemed our eyes must meet in a great understanding and yet loath they struggled away and did not meet
BTS Your method of reasoning is the opposite to that of science
BTS The hunter in turn was in a quandary
BTS Hands were ripping and tearing at my flesh and garments
BTS Think so
BTS I was growing excited but she interrupted me with an Oh I see and her voice sounded weary
BTS she queried teasingly
BTS Without warning without trace men and women and even children disappeared and were seen no more their end shrouded in mystery
BTS Wolf Larsen had been smitten with one of his headaches and I stood at the wheel from morning until evening sailing across the ocean after the last lee boat and heaving to and picking it and the other five up without command or suggestion from him
BTS You'd better stick by the sled his partner protested
BTS The upshot of the affair was that she accompanied me next morning
BTS In California the custom of rabbit-driving obtained
BTS He was suspicious of the looming bulks of the trees and of the dark shadows that might conceal all manner of perilous things
BTS Look at 'm wag his tail
BTS What was his god's was to be defended against all the world even to the extent of biting other gods
BTS All oppression originated in the trusts and one and all told the same tale of woe
BTS Weedon telegraph at once to San Francisco for Doctor Nichols
BTS With the coming of night in the mid-afternoon the cries sounded closer as the pursuers drew in according to their custom
BTS You are compelled to form a new political party because the old parties are in the hands of the trusts
BTS Cherokee might well have been disembowelled had he not quickly pivoted on his grip and got his body off of White Fang's and at right angles to it
BTS But don't try it on Wolf Larsen
BTS His attempt to maintain his dignity was heroic
BTS Nevertheless he was a meek and lowly servant and there is no record of his having been insolent
BTS You preach what you believe
BTS The tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks
BTS He saw the camp again the tepees and the blaze of the fires
BTS Francois complied whereupon Buck trotted in laughing triumphantly and swung around into position at the head of the team
BTS His eyes saw correctly and the nerves carried the vision correctly to his brain
BTS It would seem your function is to twist truth at the command of your employers who in turn obey the behests of the corporations
BTS I took it from Larsen's private stores
BTS Like sea-sickness I suppose
BTS Humphrey Van Weyden
BTS Here is night and the wind blowing us off the land
BTS Unpossessed of conscience or moral instinct you might have mastered the world broken it to your hand
BTS for some were seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle and with a rift of white centring down the chest
BTS I mean that this load of ourn is gettin' on your nerves an' that you're beginnin' to see things
BTS They went on their way but she did not move
BTS broke off the side of one of these knolls and toppled it into the hole where the Everhards made their refuge
BTS He's gone off his food again Matt remarked from his bunk
BTS but fear passed into terror until finally his yelps were voiced in unbroken succession unconnected with the rhythm of the punishment
BTS And the woman I loved was Maud Brewster
BTS There were seals all about us in the water and the bellowing thousands on the beach compelled us to shout at each other to make ourselves heard
BTS Now we shall become real proletarians father said when we were driven from our home
BTS There was a crunch of breaking bone and the white dog faced him on three legs
BTS Go on home and tell them what's happened to me
BTS and small manufacturers and farmers to-day are reduced to all intents and purposes to feudal tenure
BTS I haven't anything to do with that
BTS Their policy is to print nothing that is a vital menace to the established
BTS But such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and vexation on the part of Francois
BTS But that did not loosen the jaws
BTS The old unnamable terror mounted into her eyes
BTS You are lick-spittlers and panderers the creatures of the Plutocracy
BTS though he did not know that it was the rest of the lynx litter that had gone to satisfy her
BTS As Ernest talked he seemed in a fine passion
BTS Again there was a puff of smoke and a loud report this time the cannon-ball striking not more than twenty feet astern and glancing twice from sea to sea to windward ere it sank
BTS That was the slight difference that was left between the workingman and him
BTS He was half drowned and Hans and Pete threw themselves upon him pounding the breath into him and the water out of him
BTS It made a queer grating noise
BTS At last after what seemed centuries unable longer to stand the strain I looked around
BTS She fired six shots before they got her though what damage she did we could not know
BTS Here's your bandana
BTS Pertonwaithe and Mrs
BTS We learned afterward how it happened
BTS The load quivered and from under the runners arose a crisp crackling
BTS Without warning the love-master disappeared
BTS Only Spencer and myself know how hard I hammered
BTS That'll do easy as she goes Wolf Larsen counselled back
BTS and his head somewhat broader was the wolf head on a massive scale
BTS He was born of humble parents and began his career as a bartender
BTS After that the she-wolf in her hunting avoided the left fork
BTS Beauty Smith decided that the snow was the safest place for him and lay where he had fallen making no effort to get up
BTS The daily suppressage
BTS If you will be advised by me this is what you will do
BTS All trace of the young oligarch must be obliterated
BTS But I must not overwork it she broke in
BTS That mast goes in to-day
BTS My work is done well
BTS We turned our heads swayed by a common impulse to see the last of the Ghost
BTS And the life-preserver in which I floated
BTS The stick prevented him from getting at the leather that fastened the other end
BTS And you
BTS Who was she that she should be too good for cabin table and cabin society
BTS And toy that I was of this monster the discussion of Omar and the Preacher was resumed
BTS The huskies had chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings
BTS It just hinted of the eagle beak
BTS He called his comrades to witness the sight
BTS We want in our hands the reins of power and the destiny of mankind
BTS He was whining softly and as Buck whined they touched noses
BTS His body pitched out and down but in some way he managed to save himself with his legs
BTS But greater than that to the wolf-cub was their mastery over things not alive
BTS We must have been well in the path of the trans-Pacific steamships when the typhoon moderated and here to the surprise of the hunters we found ourselves in the midst of seals a second herd or sort of rear-guard they declared and a most unusual thing
BTS These I whittled into shavings or split into kindling
BTS She made a moue of disappointment
BTS Make it do
BTS And yet there was Jackson
BTS Well Cooky
BTS Very good
BTS There was some very good reason I was sure why Jackson's case had gone against him
BTS But I noticed also whenever one with a show of fight tried to break past that her eyes glinted and showed bright and she rapped it smartly with her club
BTS He turned to White Fang
BTS O'Connor the president of the Association of Machinists had been foremost of the six leaders present in refusing to give such assurance
BTS It was brought about by a conversation in the Eldorado Saloon in which men waxed boastful of their favorite dogs
BTS It became a nightmare
BTS And there was a wind blowing upon me which I could not resist swaying the very body of me till I leaned toward her all unconscious that I leaned
BTS The nose was a favorite organ to work upon
BTS Did you hear or see anything on deck
BTS All he asked of other dogs was to be let alone
BTS and her present litter of puppies gave her the right to resent such intrusion
BTS It's going to be hell there
BTS Then Grey Beaver took a knife from a sheath that hung around his neck and went into the thicket and cut a stick
BTS Leach was shouting
BTS Come and see Biedenbach answered with his adorable accent
BTS Possibly he accepted it as one of the restrictions of life
BTS I had an instinct for proportion myself and I collapsed forthwith descending from the dominant pose of a master of matter to a state of humble confusion which was to say the least very miserable
BTS It was a distinct victory I had gained and I refused to forego any of it by shaking his detestable hand
BTS The proletariat with its twenty millions engaged in occupations
BTS Wolf Larsen was studying the clouding sky to windward
BTS The fact man the irrefragable fact
BTS And so it went
BTS My health is better for it he added hastily
BTS My shears were too short
BTS This was no soil for kindliness and affection to blossom in
BTS There is not a man aboard but hates or fears him nor is there a man whom he does not despise
BTS The changes in expression they accomplished were wizard-like
BTS and such was his forward momentum and the unexpectedness of it White Fang was hurled to the ground and rolled clear over
BTS I boiled the water but it was Maud who made the coffee
BTS White Fang's snarling began with the movement and increased as the movement approached its culmination
BTS Twenty-eight hundred of them had been annihilated in a tremendous series of dynamite explosions in Oregon and in a similar manner a number of train loads at different times and places had been destroyed
BTS Capital does not consume the remaining two billions
BTS Philosophers
BTS His information died with him
BTS for no longer as up to yesterday will the artists pander to the bourgeois taste of the middle class
BTS Leave the present battle to youth and strength
BTS The backers of Cherokee waxed jubilant and offered ridiculous odds
BTS But we could not tell which was which--which building contained our comrades and which the Mercenaries
BTS It was not until I became the old Avis Everhard and whispered secrets in his ear that none knew but he and Avis Everhard that he accepted me as his really truly wife
BTS Eh
BTS Common decency
BTS At midday not only did the sun warm the southern horizon but it even thrust its upper rim pale and golden above the sky-line
BTS Van Weyden has discovered that
BTS All this was the manifestation of power
BTS A strong hand gripped me and when the Ghost finally emerged I found that I owed my life to Johnson
BTS I might have guessed an Englishman would know
BTS I asked gently
BTS I found him in a crazy ramshackle house down near the bay on the edge of the marsh
BTS Asmunsen remarked
BTS Upon his inward sight was impressed a succession of memory-pictures
BTS They were stirred by him but they were too sure of their own strength
BTS He was a slave to the industrial machine and it stamped his life out worked him to death
BTS Expect all hell to break loose he cautioned me but don't mind it
BTS But this time Beauty Smith left him tied with a stick
BTS A thousand times this occurred and each time the terror it inspired was as vivid and great as ever
BTS She laughed with amused appreciation
BTS Kowalt suggested
BTS I was still a tyro so far as concerned knowing how to behave in desperate circumstances
BTS Something's gone wrong with my brain
BTS she said and laid her fingers lightly on my lips
BTS There were no more spats and squabbles no more tiny rages nor attempts at growling
BTS White Fang came near to him and watched
BTS I know it's a sort of machine-breaking and that it is absurd
BTS Hunting herself for meat up the left fork of the stream where lived the lynx she had followed a day-old trail of One Eye
BTS The cook had glided in
BTS Francois cried slapping his thighs gleefully
BTS But Baseek did not wait
BTS In time the unknown as a thing of terror and menace ever impending faded away
BTS I passed my hand over the horny projections and my teeth went on edge once more from the horrible rasping sensation produced
BTS sir what kind of a craft is this
BTS Thank you Mr
BTS From regarding me curiously he turned his head and glanced out over the leaden sea to windward
BTS His newspapers were published in all the large cities and they appealed to the perishing middle class and to the proletariat
BTS Very creditable very creditable Dr
BTS I looked at her
BTS And the absurd thing about it is that you have repeated these phrases so often that you believe them
BTS But he was consumed with indignation real or feigned
BTS for even now though Ernest is gone we are on the verge of the revolt that will sweep all oligarchies away
BTS In fashion distantly resembling the way men look upon the gods they create so looked White Fang upon the man-animals before him
BTS I don't know one of them frankly said
BTS He oppressed the weak but he respected the strong
BTS And yet though I even removed the handcuffs we could not adjust ourselves to his condition
BTS To their ears came the sounds of dogs wrangling and scuffling the guttural cries of men the sharper voices of scolding women and once the shrill and plaintive cry of a child
BTS All he had to do when the strange dogs came ashore was to show himself
BTS Asmunsen gave an answer and then he said Yes that's it except that we do not object to the others making profits so long as they are not extortionate
BTS But when the butt of the topmast was level with the rail everything came to a standstill
BTS Then quiet again though the gamins had startled and listened like young deer at the sound
BTS But they had been domesticated for generations
BTS A man of whom to be always afraid  That's the way to put it
BTS Thus it was that the hunt of White Fang became their chief game a deadly game withal and at all times a serious game
BTS It's going to be hell there but I'd give ten years of my life for your chance to be in it
BTS CHAPTER XXXIV It's too bad the Ghost has lost her masts
BTS And truly the war would have done all these things had it not been for the socialists
BTS He should a-got the damages
BTS But suddenly with remarkable swiftness Lip-lip leaped in delivering a slashing snap and leaped away again
BTS The Oligarchy would see to that
BTS Several such illustrations culled from the documents of the times are here appended
BTS There was a new note in his mate's warning snarl
BTS McCready and Swanson
BTS I followed them intently fixing up my hair at the same time and pinning together my torn skirts
BTS As fast as the prisoners came over the rail they were marshalled forward to the forecastle by our hunters while our sailors hoisted in the boats pell-mell dropping them anywhere upon the deck and not stopping to lash them
BTS And look at that good wood
BTS The Ghost was being wrenched and torn to fragments
BTS A wild thought of rushing in and killing her as she slept rose in my mind
BTS He is a free spirit surely I answered
BTS That's why
BTS Assured of their faithfulness the Iron Heel can snap its fingers at all the rest of labor
BTS A quick snappy sea was being kicked up by the wind a condition which prevented fine shooting
BTS It was really not a part of our organization
BTS It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law and he met the introduction halfway
BTS Nor is it in your power even to make it stand still
BTS This was his one trouble in the running of the pack
BTS But as birds flew in the air squirrels could climb trees and the cub could only try to crawl unobserved upon the squirrel when it was on the ground
BTS With the enthusiasm of a boy he plunged excitedly into these new pursuits regardless of whither they led him
BTS It may possibly be your misfortune that you have to remain with us but it is certainly our good fortune
BTS Dr
BTS Van Weyden you'd better look in on Cooky
BTS There was momentum in the twentieth century while there was practically none in ancient Rome
BTS Let there be no rattling of blocks no sound of voices
BTS The four Indians laughed more loudly while even the man who had been bitten began to laugh
BTS It impressed one with its sullen determination to blow and blow harder and keep on blowing
BTS From to-day a child will be able to navigate a ship
BTS Tim Keenan continued standing over him but Scott took no further notice of his presence
BTS He did not love his kind and he was shrewd enough to escape hurt himself
BTS The old awe departed and they grew equal to challenging his authority
BTS Better have a club handy Matt warned
BTS And it would have gone hard with him had not Collie appeared on the scene
BTS The little airs he put on and the painful striving to assume the easy carriage of a man born to a dignified place in life would have been sickening had they not been ludicrous
BTS Ernest queried
BTS I must go at once
BTS I suggested
BTS So he stepped boldly out upon the air
BTS Then I glanced at Ernest with curious interest such as any young comrade might betray on seeing for the first time so noted a hero of the Revolution
BTS And you
BTS There was no hope for the mastiff from the first
BTS Couldn't miss it
BTS There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life and beyond which life cannot rise
BTS This is of course no reflection on you Ernest said
BTS It was the afternoon that the master was to ride and White Fang knew it
BTS It was Wolf Larsen's turn to be puzzled
BTS He came to a stop and blinked across at White Fang
BTS He was given no rest
BTS A shrill and minute singing stole upon his hearing
BTS A panic seized him and he ran madly toward the village
BTS '  A noted educator of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries of the Christian Era
BTS Which reminds me of Bishop Morehouse whom I have neglected for many pages
BTS It was after such encounters that the dead and wounded were carted back to the towns and their places filled by men eager for the man-hunt
BTS Thus he could avoid the leap of another dog or the drive of its fangs and at the same moment could seize the infinitesimal fraction of time in which to deliver his own attack
BTS He crawled straight toward Grey Beaver every inch of his progress becoming slower and more painful
BTS Looks nasty he commented
BTS Topsails would be a nuisance and a danger for a crew of two so I heaved the topmasts on deck and lashed them fast
BTS Neither could he mobilize his army to go forth to war nor could he punish his recalcitrant subjects
BTS It was at this time that Senator Mark Hanna said The production of wealth in the United States is one-third larger annually than its consumption
BTS He was too quick for the others
BTS They saw Charles turn and make one step to run back and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear
BTS Choice of work was denied them
BTS It struggled and tickled his tongue
BTS but behind him were the shades of all manner of dogs half-wolves and wild wolves urgent and prompting tasting the savor of the meat he ate thirsting for the water he drank scenting the wind with him listening with him and telling him the sounds made by the wild life in the forest dictating his moods directing his actions lying down to sleep with him when he lay down and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff of his dreams
BTS A quarter of a mile from Glen Ellen after the second bridge is passed to the right will be noticed a barranca that runs like a scar across the rolling land toward a group of wooded knolls
BTS Not that I was afraid of it however or reluctant to meet it
BTS the quality that has enabled the wolf and the wild dog to come in from the open and be the companions of man
BTS It marked midnight
BTS Then they came upon moose
BTS But here amongst ourselves let us speak out
BTS To his dim comprehension they were as much wonder-workers as gods are to men
BTS And there is no milk for the coffee
BTS There was something repulsive about his touch
BTS It was a brief fight and fierce
BTS I read immortality in your eyes I answered dropping the sir an experiment for I thought the intimacy of the conversation warranted it
BTS He tried to back away from her oblivious to the fact that by his hold on her he dragged her after him
BTS I had come up on deck for a breath of fresh air and to try to get some repose for my overwrought nerves
BTS Its voting strength in the United States in 1888 was 2068
BTS On the one hand it costs you nothing to encounter danger
BTS He who delights the most lives the most and your dreams and unrealities are less disturbing to you and more gratifying than are my facts to me
BTS It was not alone what he had said and how he had said it but it was the man himself
BTS The old have no chance
BTS He found Pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment of surprise
BTS I am only a weak woman but just my small assistance may enable you to escape disaster
BTS So he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day's travel
