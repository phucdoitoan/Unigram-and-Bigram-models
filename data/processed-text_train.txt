BTS Those dear tired eyes
BTS Observing the same principle of widest distribution of weight the dogs at the ends of their ropes radiated fan-fashion from the nose of the sled so that no dog trod in another's footsteps
BTS She waited
BTS It was at this time that I was approached by Leach
BTS Fantastic as the situation was a land-lubber second in command I was nevertheless carrying it off well
BTS He shook it but his hand felt clammy
BTS I caught father grinning into his napkin
BTS If ever Wolf Larsen attained the summit of living he attained it then
BTS It did not enter his head that in the Southland it was otherwise
BTS Then he became angry
BTS We overhauled them about two feet to their one
BTS The Iron Heel learned its lesson
BTS His back was toward me and at the first feel of my hand he leaped upright in the air and away from me snarling and turning his head as he leaped
BTS Sir
BTS My
BTS He would not have ventured so long a trip had he not expected generous profits
BTS And return to the ways of your fathers Ernest finished for him
BTS Jock' Horner they call him so quiet-like an' easy-goin' soft-spoken as a girl till ye'd think butter wouldn't melt in the mouth iv him
BTS Colonel Van Gilbert remained silent a sullen superior expression on his face such as will appear on the face of a man who will not bandy words with a ruffian
BTS They go away in the fall so I must soon begin to lay in a supply of meat
BTS Maud clapped her hands the instant she was relieved from holding the turn crying It works
BTS I started to rush below to the flag-locker then remembered that in rigging the Ghost
BTS Our food will not last but there are the seals
BTS Anything to say
BTS partly in horror partly out of curiosity
BTS For that matter look at you and me
BTS We agreed that this surplus could only be disposed of abroad
BTS D
BTS I fixed him he repeated while a sombre light burnt in his eyes and his huge toil-distorted hands opened and closed eloquently
BTS Had it been some other hunter's boat-puller he like them would have been no more than amused
BTS No not that
BTS As he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly with caution in every movement till he came to an open place among the trees and looking out saw erect on haunches with nose pointed to the sky a long lean timber wolf
BTS The wind was freshening rapidly the Ghost heeling over more and more and by the time the state-room was ready she was dashing through the water at a lively clip
BTS Well Leach are you going for'ard
BTS When Weedon and Maud had first approached him he growled warningly and looked malignant
BTS Too many bitter strikes had been curbed there in the days of capitalism for the workers to forget and forgive
BTS thrust his loneliness more forcibly upon him
BTS I remember the Forge
BTS The rest was a dream no more than the memory of a dream
BTS If you're afraid to tell me your way out I'll tell it to you
BTS Mr
BTS He watched the man-animals coming and going and moving about the camp
BTS Above the sky is stainless blue blue as the sea itself which under the forefoot is of the colour and sheen of azure satin
BTS For nineteen years now the refuge that I selected had been almost continuously occupied and in all that time with one exception it has never been discovered by an outsider
BTS There was no opposing them
BTS I had just pointed them out to Hartman when a sheet of flame and smoke ran along that portion of the face of the building where the heads had appeared and the air was shaken by the explosion
BTS It no longer was as one dog leaping in the traces
BTS At the end of such a romp when blow and cuff and snap and snarl were fast and furious they would break off suddenly and stand several feet apart glaring at each other
BTS but the expression of determination on her face did not relax
BTS No one heeded them
BTS And Maud Brewster
BTS At last I sank down on the sidewalk
BTS What if he did swashbuckle
BTS With this triple killing his main troubles with dogs ceased
BTS My body was stiff from exertion as well as from cold and my aching muscles gave me the severest torture whenever I used them and I used them continually
BTS no effort of will can possibly induce disbelief in such a god
BTS In truth it had been so long since I had received sympathy that I was softened and I became then and gladly her willing slave
BTS Oh
BTS It has to be sold abroad
BTS Then boost him
BTS And when there was no meat to give Mit-sah would keep the team at a distance and make believe to give meat to Lip-lip
BTS You are good to look upon in a way I qualified
BTS When he overtook White Fang he reached down and by the nape of the neck lifted him clear of the water
BTS He stepped away from the rifle and White Fang's lifted lips descended covering his teeth
BTS The one comrade Congressman we did not get was Arthur Simpson and he had already died in Cabanas after cruel tortures
BTS Why was he beaten out of heaven
BTS The great driving force of the oligarchs is the belief that they are doing right
BTS He was obviously questing back through Ernest's reasoning in search of an error
BTS You must be very very careful of your health Cooky
BTS He proceeded very slowly and cautiously an inch at a time
BTS A hundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest Police with fifty dogs huskies all who joined the chase
BTS So White Fang could only eat his heart in bitterness and develop a hatred and malice commensurate with the ferocity and indomitability of his nature
BTS He was a beautiful creature almost feminine in the pleasing lines of his figure and there was a softness and dreaminess in his large eyes which seemed to contradict his well-earned reputation for strife and action
BTS You have given shelter to an enemy of your class he said
BTS His method was to drive straight at the intruder and to sink his teeth in if he could
BTS For your own good I warn you
BTS I think the Bishop's example so far as wearing apparel was concerned must have fascinated father for he wore the cheap cotton shirt of the laborer and the overalls with the narrow strap about the hips
BTS Like most creatures of the Wild he early experienced famine
BTS So it was that the socialists succeeded in making Australia and New Zealand into cooperative commonwealths
BTS In the great museum at Asgard there is a book entitled Essays in Application written by Henry van Dyke
BTS Death stalked everywhere and it was only a matter of time when some one of those many huge seas would fall upon the boat roll over it and pass on
BTS I did not argue
BTS If you paid advertising rates you couldn't get any such matter into the papers
BTS I made it pretty awkward for him and he could only go on repeating himself and telling me how much he honored me and all the world honored me as a scientist
BTS While a slaughter-house was made of the nation by the capitalist the Church was dumb
BTS No I repeat metaphysics had nothing to do with it
BTS She ceased talking and nodding her head went on stitching
BTS And grip and thrill they did till I fell asleep murmuring them to myself over and over again
BTS I am sure if I ever get home that I shall never be irritable with them again
BTS It was in Berlin that I met him where as an accredited international spy of the Iron Heel I was received by him and afforded much assistance
BTS One boat lowered away with the plugs out filled with women and children and then with water and capsized
BTS Now you must promise you won't be harsh with them for the rest of the trip or I won't go a step
BTS Buck never came near Spitz without snarling and bristling menacingly
BTS We're dead men I know it
BTS At such times her running mates flashed their teeth and growled threateningly across at each other
BTS In those days it was still the custom to fill the living rooms with bric-a-brac
BTS His mate warned him irritably away and he curled up and slept in the entrance
BTS And Chicago became the storm-centre of the premature First Revolt
BTS These misguided people sacrificed their own lives wantonly very often made our own plans go astray and retarded our organization
BTS And here in the Klondike the leader was indeed the leader
BTS One side or the other of his nature was perfectly comprehensible
BTS I must get the jib backed over
BTS His face brightened
BTS If he has  I muttered savagely
BTS Of course he is foredoomed to futility
BTS But he is not all wolf interposed Beth standing for her brother in his absence
BTS The hours passed like ages
BTS On deck I found the Ghost doing splendidly under her patch of canvas
BTS Never had labor received such an all-around beating
BTS Ballingford glanced around the table and was rewarded by nods and smiles of approval
BTS To make it worse the light of the sky was obscured and snow began to fall a raw moist melting clinging snow slippery under foot that hid from him the landscape he traversed and that covered over the inequalities of the ground so that the way of his feet was more difficult and painful
BTS It is a Titan's task
BTS Thomas Mugridge is becoming unendurable
BTS That you should not answer is intolerable Ernest replied gravely
BTS A man who leaves his money lying around the way you did deserves to lose it
BTS As soon as the secret of the defection of the favored unions leaked out there were rumblings and mutterings in the labor world
BTS Like the savage the attitude of these men was stoical in great things childish in little things
BTS The jaws opened with reluctance and Wolf Larsen stepped free
BTS What do you believe then
BTS It is what we of the working class preach
BTS He was strolling leisurely along the poop on the port side
BTS This division of society made by Everhard is in accordance with that made by Lucien Sanial one of the statistical authorities of that time
BTS Men were scurrying down the gang-plank to the shore
BTS And now if the gods be truly kind we shall drift by that next headland and come upon a perfectly sheltered beach where we may land without wetting our feet
BTS I could hear him crying
BTS The brutal years had reduced his meagre body to splintered wreckage and yet the spark of life within burned brightly as ever
BTS I am at your disposal
BTS By the light of the fire he crooked his fingers slowly and repeatedly now one at a time now all together spreading them wide or making quick gripping movements
BTS Grey Beaver was his own particular god and in spite of Grey Beaver's will White Fang still clung to him and would not give him up
BTS In which case it would find itself face to face with the dog attacked and also it would find itself facing the whip of the driver
BTS for he cowered perceptibly and dragged himself on
BTS Why does the United States lag behind
BTS Tough as they make them and twice as nasty
BTS For that matter the strength of the Revolution during these frightful twenty years has resided in nothing else than the sense of righteousness
BTS Institutions and governments were everywhere crashing or transforming
BTS Heaven and hell may be the prime factors of zeal in the religion of a fanatic
BTS It was at night
BTS He snarled and bristled and flattened his ears
BTS We called the last meal of the day supper in our new environment
BTS His neck was the neck of a prize-fighter thick and strong
BTS and so through the generations clients and lawyers pursued the illusion
BTS What happened in the next few minutes I do not recollect though I have a clear remembrance of pulling down life-preservers from the overhead racks while the red-faced man fastened them about the bodies of an hysterical group of women
BTS There was something calling to him out there in the open
BTS will not drive us hence
BTS They drive the seals in small herds a short distance inland before they kill them
BTS They were all too soft dying under the toil the frost and starvation
BTS she interrupted with that softness I knew full well to be insistence
BTS but as it descended it slowly twisted so that square would not fit into square
BTS He had never learned to play with them
BTS It was not too cold
BTS They were too cool-headed and courageous for that
BTS It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law and he met the introduction halfway
BTS As though I stood in need of their money
BTS This happened during the time when calamity had overtaken us in our own affairs
BTS He had just destroyed little live things
BTS The struggle then will be for the ownership of the machines
BTS This construction enabled the weight of the sled and load to be distributed over the largest snow-surface
BTS It is absurd
BTS They may dose me and doctor me morning noon and night and dust and sweep and put my den to rights every minute of the day and I shall only lean back and survey it all and be thankful in that I am possessed of a mother and some several sisters
BTS Eyelashes and cheeks and lips were so coated with the crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible
BTS Having learned to snuggle White Fang was guilty of it often
BTS Come on now and I'll get you out of this
BTS Billee and Joe he called them two brothers and true huskies both
BTS Her stick was tied to a peg in the ground and she could not follow him
BTS The calm and control which were so much a part of her seemed to have been communicated to the blankets so that I was aware of a soft dreaminess and content and of an oval face and brown eyes framed in a fisherman's cap and tossing against a background now of grey cloud now of grey sea and then I was aware that I had been asleep
BTS No spring or rebound was left in them
BTS Blown by mouth
BTS Bernard had been the Judge's inseparable companion and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father
BTS For the first time I knew the wonderful truth of his words
BTS But with this difference Ernest laughed
BTS He noticed me and I became conscious that I was staring at him
BTS Nobody knew he had been forced to resign from the university
BTS Power
BTS It was a torment this hand that touched him and violated his instinct
BTS It was the Plutocracy weighing and balancing that defeated us by dividing our strength
BTS Also it was asserted by more than one paper that father's mind had weakened under the strain of scientific study and confinement in a state asylum for the insane was suggested
BTS It always aroused people
BTS Altogether we'll have our hands full if we find the island uninhabited
BTS The crowd began to grow unruly and some of the men were protesting against the spoiling of the sport
BTS I turned and saw him standing just beneath the break of the poop on the port side of the galley
BTS Of all this White Fang knew nothing
BTS It must have spies in my employ and it must have access to the parties to all my contracts
BTS The streets were crowded with perils waggons carts automobiles
BTS The crowd fell silent
BTS Retreating before Lip-lip White Fang made an indirect flight that led in and out and around the various tepees of the camp
BTS Then I glanced at Ernest with curious interest such as any young comrade might betray on seeing for the first time so noted a hero of the Revolution
BTS He has all my my  Brutishness I suggested
BTS There could be but one ending
BTS A warning snarl told him that the trespasser was Spitz
BTS A crisis had come in world affairs
BTS This was the ancient covenant that the first wolf that came in from the Wild entered into with man
BTS I was so comfortable and secure that even his flaming lyrics failed to stir me
BTS Then all fight fled out of him
BTS The porcupine met his approach with a furious squealing and a clashing of its long teeth
BTS The Oligarchy will encourage such ambition and the consequent competition
BTS I cried
BTS The man who plotted beside us for all we knew might be an agent of the Iron Heel
BTS he asked seriously
BTS I queried
BTS They were the most hopeless of all I had encountered in my quest
BTS I halted
BTS Very probably was Wolf Larsen's answer as he turned partly away from me and cried out Cooky
BTS I could see that she wavered
BTS Do you remember not so long ago when our regular army was only fifty thousand
BTS And then I had ceased seeking
BTS Such an army of revolution he said twenty-five millions strong is a thing to make rulers and ruling classes pause and consider
BTS Neither can I I said
BTS But it was a growl with a new note in it
BTS I was never so nauseated in my life with overplus of fallacy
BTS There were warnings but I did not heed them
BTS And White Fang just as bitterly hated them back
BTS This bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on July 30 1902 was the reply
BTS They were stirred by him but they were too sure of their own strength
BTS How unusual
BTS In spite of his armour of fur the great vein of his throat would have long since been torn open had not the first grip of the bull-dog been so low down as to be practically on the chest
BTS But he had pride
BTS I might have guessed an Englishman would know
BTS A day of clear weather might follow or three days or four and then the fog would settle down upon us seemingly thicker than ever
BTS Then later becoming firmly grounded automatic the student reads writes and THINKS in French without any recourse to English at all
BTS And yet outside of pain the only feeling I possessed was one of curiosity
BTS My imagination ran riot and still I could not sleep
BTS What d'ye say
BTS And they were forgetting themselves now
BTS Till now Buck had avoided trouble with his enemy but this was too much
BTS At the same moment I swayed as about to fall to the sand
BTS Chicago had always been the storm-centre of the conflict between labor and capital a city of street-battles and violent death with a class-conscious capitalist organization and a class-conscious workman organization where in the old days the very school-teachers were formed into labor unions and affiliated with the hod-carriers and brick-layers in the American Federation of Labor
BTS Wolf Larsen shall live in the steerage
BTS I pointed it out to Maud and hurriedly led her aft to the safety of the poop
BTS It was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come
BTS It was the call the many-noted call sounding more luringly and compellingly than ever before
BTS Kowalt and Mr
BTS guard with your preaching the interests of your employers
BTS It does very well it seems though I am not versed in things nautical she said nodding her head with grave approval at my steering contrivance
BTS Had I been father or brother the situation would have been in nowise different
BTS The she-wolf was angry
BTS See if you don't
BTS He turned to White Fang
BTS It was cleverly done
BTS Shut up your wishin' and your croakin' Henry burst out angrily
BTS The driver was surprised too
BTS He met her next rush with his chest in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet
BTS The exhibition they make of their feelings is not a touching sight yet it shows how deeply they have been touched how deeply their purses have been touched for to lay hands on their purses is to lay hands on their souls
BTS All his life he had disliked children
BTS So sudden was it and so unexpected that Buck was taken aback
BTS It is piggishness and it is life
BTS But you have the concrete wealth twenty-four billions of it and the Plutocracy will take it away from you
BTS He is as Lucifer would be were that proud spirit banished to a society of soulless Tomlinsonian ghosts
BTS You are surely a free agent
BTS He sleeps with a revolver on the stand by the bed I answered
BTS He looked uncomfortable for the moment then brightened as he saw his way out
BTS For two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives
BTS he asked
BTS he warned
BTS It filled him with a great unrest and strange desires
BTS One cannot violate the promptings of one's nature without having that nature recoil upon itself
BTS In an insane fit of jealousy he killed his wife--a very common act in those times
BTS Mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice
BTS Pocock V
BTS And we fled eastward through the quiet streets prepared at every cross street for anything to happen
BTS He waited a moment as though seeking where to begin and then said Hump do you know the parable of the sower who went forth to sow
BTS Again the knife was raised and Wolf Larsen would have surely died had she not stepped between
BTS Body and brain his was a more perfected mechanism
BTS Once a writer friend of mine had owned the ranch
BTS It was evident that he was badly frightened
BTS Then there was the militia
BTS I queried
BTS Having instructed Thomas Mugridge as to what he was to do I clambered into the fore-rigging a few feet
BTS It smacked of danger
BTS They were convinced that they were the saviours of society and that it was they who made happiness for the many
BTS But the supply of food and the nine breakers of water enabled the boat to stand up to the sea and wind and I held on as long as I dared
BTS There was no sympathetic relation between his tail and his massive jaws
BTS The fact that he had but one eye and that the left eye might account for this
BTS Lively now
BTS The Toil of Trace and Trail Thirty days from the time it left Dawson the Salt Water Mail with Buck and his mates at the fore arrived at Skaguay
BTS He's coming to see how we take it
BTS Half of them I am sure were anxious to see us shedding each other's blood
BTS It was all automatic
BTS They looked upon themselves as wild-animal trainers rulers of beasts
BTS The horrid picture of anarchy was held always before their child's eyes until they in turn obsessed by this cultivated fear held the picture of anarchy before the eyes of the children that followed them
BTS I was told that they thanked no one for instructing them in their social duties
BTS I have since determined that a part of it was due to the man's personality but that the greater part was due to his totally different outlook
BTS They were no match at all were it not for their arrows and spears and clubs
BTS When a system is founded upon class how can caste be prevented
BTS But let me tell you this before you go
BTS And what is more you know it
BTS It was its absolute simplicity that convinced even while one continued to doubt
BTS But something lacked
BTS So changed was he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him
BTS At midday the sky to the south warmed to rose-colour and marked where the bulge of the earth intervened between the meridian sun and the northern world
BTS Then it was that that clannishness which was his to so extraordinary a degree asserted itself
BTS Immediately after such fights he had always been imprisoned again
BTS Of course the militia law did not work smoothly at first
BTS Wolf Larsen answered and as he started to ascend the stairs I cocked my revolver
BTS Gold in the form of securities and bonds and so forth Mr
BTS Three broken ribs one at least of which has pierced the lungs
BTS Furthermore from the very beginning of the capitalist system capital has never consumed all of its share
BTS Since the finding of the Manuscript excavations have been made and the house the two cave rooms and all the accumulated rubbish of long occupancy have been brought to light
BTS You see the powerful interests rising and growing more powerful day by day
BTS She bounded in amongst them her anxious and militant motherhood making her anything but a pretty sight
BTS by spells my right side seemed going to sleep sometimes arm or hand sometimes leg or foot
BTS But I am mate now and when I pay off at 'Frisco maybe with five hundred dollars I will ship myself on a windjammer round the Horn to Liverpool which will give me more money
BTS Johnson seems to spend all his spare time there or aloft at the crosstrees watching the Ghost cleaving the water under press of sail
BTS And as Buck understood the oaths to be love words so the man understood this feigned bite for a caress
BTS Lost they indubitably were
BTS I looked quickly at Wolf Larsen
BTS It is true we elected fifty Congressmen
BTS Tormented incited to hate he was kept a prisoner so that there was no way of satisfying that hate except at the times his master saw fit to put another dog against him
BTS but prominent occupying most of the space was the long and narrow oblong box
BTS Shouting making threatening gestures with my club and even prodding the lazy ones I quickly cut out a score of the young bachelors from their companions
BTS CHAPTER VI ADUMBRATIONS It was about this time that the warnings of coming events began to fall about us thick and fast
BTS Then naught came up out of the blackness save a heavy panting of some creature struggling sorely for air
BTS He was not so large he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds for his mother Shep had been a Scotch shepherd dog
BTS and again his eyes roved over every sail and he gave commands to slack a sheet here a trifle to come in on one there a trifle till he was drawing out of the Ghost the last bit of speed she possessed
BTS It did happen to see the light in a newspaper I replied but not because the magazine editors had been denied a glimpse at it
BTS I turned to re-examine Thomas Mugridge's work
BTS To-night he is chairman of the I
BTS From wincing he went to whimpering
BTS As we drew closer the sail was taken in and the mast unstepped
BTS On the other hand when there have been accidents increased expenses of operating or contracts with less profitable terms I have always succeeded in getting the railroad to lower its rate
BTS but it was impossible to make the dogs travel faster while their own inability to get under way earlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours
BTS In place of strikes will be slave revolts
BTS It was the trap ever the trap the fear of it lurking deep in the life of him woven into the fibre of him
BTS This man talking soberly and earnestly about the beauties of idealism and the goodness of God had just betrayed his comrades in a business deal
BTS The Bishop nodded
BTS It is the word of God
BTS In truth I was no longer the fine gentleman with a skin soft as a lydy's but only an ordinary and very worthless cabin-boy
BTS They moved at once to the head of the room from where he was to speak
BTS With them it was snap and slash and get away snap and slash and get away
BTS Very good
BTS He awoke as gently as he slept
BTS As for the militia the militia law of 1903 was put into effect and the workers of one state were compelled under pain of death to shoot down their comrade-workers in other states
BTS An offshoot of the Seventh Day Adventists sprang into sudden prominence proclaiming the end of the world
BTS and in the latter there was no glint of laughter
BTS What does he do
BTS We could offer nothing but the satisfaction of being faithful to a noble ideal
BTS The pencil fell
BTS The courts were in the hands of the Plutocracy to carry the sentence out
BTS In the nature of Arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should not drag one sled and that was that one sled could not carry the food for fourteen dogs
BTS Francois sat down and scratched his head
BTS Then he fell and lay where he fell howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by
BTS Wot's 'e been s'yin' to yer
BTS He whined pleadingly and scurried playfully in and out of the underbrush
BTS The unknown with all its terrors rushed upon him and he shrank back instinctively into the shelter of the bush
BTS White Fang knew the law well to oppress the weak and obey the strong
BTS For the first time in his fighting history men saw White Fang lose his footing
BTS There is passion adoration in his eyes and he goes about in a sort of trance gazing in ecstasy at the swelling sails the foaming wake and the heave and the run of her over the liquid mountains that are moving with us in stately procession
BTS He recollected something dropped the burden and trotted back to where he had left the ptarmigan
BTS Colonel Van Gilbert cried out
BTS Yes even perhaps she acknowledged
BTS Whenever they propagate ideas that menace the Plutocracy they lose their jobs in which case if they have not provided for the rainy day they descend into the proletariat and either perish or become working-class agitators
BTS Now and again we saw a sail lower heard the reports of the shot-guns and saw the sail go up again
BTS In vague ways it was borne in upon him that a change was impending
BTS I waited smiling inwardly at the woman of her which compelled a solicitude for Wolf Larsen of all creatures
BTS A little thing truly but when multiplied by the thousand ingenious devices of such a mind the mental state of the men in the forecastle may be slightly comprehended
BTS There will be no passing vessels except other sealing-schooners Wolf Larsen made answer
BTS Often we were halted by the police and patrols but our passwords enabled us to proceed
BTS I'm dividing amongst them a dollar a skin for all the skins shot by our new hunters
BTS ' From hidden points of vantage the family watched the performance
BTS To serve was to suffocate
BTS This is the idea of Miss Brentwood
BTS Colonel Van Gilbert did not notice the dozen men with passion-wrought faces who strove to get permission from him to speak
BTS And as the oligarchs had done with the morning papers so had they done in a thousand other ways
BTS Occasionally a solitary male was driven out by the sharp teeth of his rivals
BTS At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states
BTS Still no one objected
BTS To me
BTS One other adventure was destined for him that day
BTS There I encountered Maud
BTS And to be imprisoned for the rest of my life amid scenes of screaming madness
BTS He felt the lurking of danger unseen and unguessed
BTS The chance came in one of his quick doublings and counter-circlings
BTS and the establishment of our underground railways which meant the knitting together of all our myriads of places of refuge and the formation of new refuges where links were missing in the chains we ran over all the land
BTS He had been man-handled
BTS But to return to the earth the workingman being selfish wants all he can get in the division
BTS But Mr
BTS I countered
BTS I'll show you another way
BTS All such attempts ended in failure
BTS But as you are not Mr
BTS He nodded his head
BTS But the sweeter music was playing in my ears and I was blind and oblivious to all about me
BTS One man can produce cotton cloth for two hundred and fifty people woollens for three hundred and boots and shoes for a thousand
BTS He stamped them into the snow under him in the wallowing struggle
BTS He whistled to himself softly first with surprise and then at the end with admiration
BTS For the first time he was being really man-handled
BTS At the Five Fingers the dog-food gave out and a toothless old squaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the Colt's revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at Hal's hip
BTS Cooky cannot hurt you
BTS There was something in the fibre of White Fang's being that made his lordship a thing to be desired else he would not have come back from the Wild when he did to tender his allegiance
BTS The national government took possession of the state government and all was over for California
BTS It was like a spirit message such as are delivered at seances of spiritualists for a dollar admission
BTS You see my argument is so clear and simple that in your own minds you carry it on for me
BTS I gazed entranced till the boat ran into the wind and the flapping sail warned me I was not attending to my duties
BTS And so it was with White Fang
BTS They made Sixty Mile which is a fifty-mile run on the first day
BTS The broad pads of his feet were bruised and bleeding
BTS The hubbub died down
BTS He was magnificently terrible
BTS You know it won't was her reply
BTS PATENT MEDICINES were patent lies but like the charms and indulgences of the Middle Ages they deceived the people
BTS and he delivered a multitude of blows
BTS If one of em' turns up missin' I'll go without my coffee
BTS She was a mulatto woman and I noticed that her face was haggard with great circles under the eyes while the eyes themselves were wide with some haunting fear
BTS She was surprised at seeing me but she nodded a pleasant greeting and went on sewing on the pair of men's trousers in her lap
BTS And then you will cease to be the middle class
BTS Both men stopped
BTS That's what's ailin' you
BTS She had heard the cry of her cub and was dashing to save him
BTS Hammerfield's hand shot up to his head where a scar disappeared under the hair
BTS And so I caught myself standing idly and studying him
BTS Thomas Mugridge turned a pitiable scared face
BTS Fish in open pools were not too quick for him
BTS While Perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled the dog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs
BTS He seized me and threw me down
BTS The coming of Maud Brewster into my life seemed to have transformed me
BTS But the beast in the mate was up and rampant and Wolf Larsen was compelled to brush him away with a back-handed sweep of the arm gentle enough apparently but which hurled Johansen back like a cork driving his head against the wall with a crash
BTS One and all from time to time they felt his teeth
BTS He still held her by the wing and they lay on the ground and looked at each other
BTS hated him for that he fled always at the head of the team his waving brush of a tail and his perpetually retreating hind-quarters for ever maddening their eyes
BTS Philosophy unifies the knowledge that is contributed by all the sciences
BTS No I answered and she questioned no further though I could have sworn her eyes retained for some time a mocking teasing expression
BTS And with the question a great light seemed to fill the place and I saw my duty sun-clear as Saul saw his on the way to Damascus
BTS So we must get ashore without swimming in some opening between the rocks through which we can drive the boat and clamber out
BTS In the morning after several trials I found the point of balance in the foremast and attached my hoisting tackle a few feet above it
BTS She was positively bewitching and withal sweetly spirituelle if not saintly
BTS It won't kill him I said
BTS Weedon Scott laughed
BTS I had used eight shells for lighting fires before I hit upon the device of banking the embers with wet moss and there remained not over a hundred shells in the box
BTS Nothing happened
BTS In the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of their animals
BTS The poor little hero
BTS Johnson looked puzzled and embarrassed
BTS He heard Grey Beaver chuckle above him and he knew the sound was not hostile
BTS And then there came to him a feeling that he wanted her more than all the rest of the things in the world
BTS demanded Matthewson a Bonanza King he of the seven hundred vaunt
BTS The boat sheered out with a rush and the hunter steadied it to a parallel course some twenty feet from the side of the Ghost
BTS The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me
BTS What is done with this balance
BTS Oh I am not challenging your sincerity Ernest continued
BTS The she-wolf flirted her head like the snap of a whip breaking the weasel's hold and flinging it high in the air
BTS The encouragement Buck gave the rebels led them into all kinds of petty misdemeanors
BTS There is to-day no doubt whatever that the Iron Heel was responsible for the bomb that exploded in the House of Representatives in 1913 A
BTS Watch me
BTS Even Ernest was astounded at the quickness with which it had been done
BTS and after that until I dozed I contented myself with trying to pierce the darkness to where I knew Maud crouched low in the stern-sheets watchful of the foaming sea and ready to call me on an instant's notice
BTS Also it looked as solid as the earth but was without any solidity at all
BTS Then I will return
BTS His furry coat shone with the sheen of silk
BTS All of them would spring upon the hated leader only to find the tables turned
BTS Then she sprang away up the trail squalling with every leap she made
BTS The hunters were laughing at a fresh story of Smoke's
BTS Like a flash Buck struck breaking the neck
BTS Sometimes he exchanged the rapier for the club and went smashing amongst their thoughts right and left
BTS This was a female of his kind and it was a law of his kind that the males must not fight the females
BTS His head was buried in his hands and his shoulders were heaving convulsively as with sobs
BTS Some of the men were already departing
BTS And at this point Bishop Dickinson arose and with an expression of disgust on his face fled from the platform and the hall
BTS Dr
BTS This is Endeavour Island I said
BTS And we shall give you an answer in terms of lead
BTS You have behaved like foolish little schoolboys what with intruding ethics and the thunder of the common politician into such a discussion
BTS The very world was not
BTS Where will your strength be then
BTS The day had been like some horrible dream
BTS These then were the cool captains of industry and lords of society these snarling growling savages in evening clothes
BTS The moment Mit-sah gave his order for the start that moment the whole team with eager savage cries sprang forward at White Fang
BTS The confined space was filled with shrieks and yells and curses
BTS and he's worth it or I'm a squarehead
BTS It was a face that rarely displayed colour but to-night it was flushed and vivacious
BTS I shouted at the top of my lungs
BTS Several men picked up the hatch-cover with its ghastly freight carried it to the lee side and rested it on the boats the feet pointing overboard
BTS Of the steamer herself nothing was to be seen
BTS Obedience rigid undeviating obedience was what was exacted of him
BTS One quill he had carried away in his muzzle where it had remained for weeks a rankling flame until it finally worked out
BTS There is one way I said grimly
BTS Many of them
BTS The men were all on deck and busy preparing their various boats for the season's hunting
BTS We are going to take your governments your palaces and all your purpled ease away from you and in that day you shall work for your bread even as the peasant in the field or the starved and runty clerk in your metropolises
BTS Hal did the talking
BTS It was an all-powerful alliance but it was an alliance of the lion and the lamb as the middle class was soon to learn
BTS Wickson and Mrs
BTS Hobbling about on it from morning till night was not helping it any
BTS I have listened carefully to all of you he began and I see plainly that you play the business game in the orthodox fashion
BTS He never lost his head
BTS Yep has fits the man said hiding his mangled hand from the baggageman who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle
BTS And yet it does seem clear as print
BTS The beginning of such a fight was a signal for all the young dogs in camp to come running and pitch upon him
BTS You see they're sure of us only they know they've got to wait to get us
BTS Your promise
BTS An' of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption behind them affirmed a second of the men
BTS He had recollected that there was such a thing in the world as his mother
BTS But his pursuers forestalling him he doubled back across the cabin passed over the galley and gained the deck by means of the steerage-scuttle
BTS He grumbles out when things don't go to suit him and there'll be always some tell-tale carryin' word iv it aft to the Wolf
BTS Whining with eagerness he followed back from the river bank and in among the trees
BTS It was Maud's and mine
BTS Good-morning to you
BTS He opened his pocket-book and counted out the bills
BTS Ernest was all fire and aliveness on the instant
BTS From the protection of his god's body to the protection of his god's possessions was a step and this step he made
BTS He was appalled
BTS As soon as death had thinned the jam Garthwaite still grasping my arm led a rush of survivors into the wide entrance of an office building
BTS Also I was awkward
BTS No caress of theirs could put the love-croon into his throat and try as they would they could never persuade him into snuggling against them
BTS When all was ready the word hard-a-lee was passed forward to me from man to man
BTS But the saloon-keeper let him alone and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate
BTS His world was gloomy
BTS He now evinced displeasure at her repeated failures and himself made a mighty spring upward
BTS After a while he said We have with us a member of the working class
BTS In fact we call that period the Dark Ages
BTS I do not care to think of it
BTS The work was done
BTS I saw them
BTS Oh he was sick of the sound of Jackson's name
BTS A hundred yards below the hole the stream ran out into open country joining the main stream and flowing across rolling and grass-covered land
BTS The nose was a favorite organ to work upon
BTS Nay he encouraged White Fang to join in the chase
BTS The sultry heat had become unendurable
BTS I felt that I was being torn to pieces
BTS We traced him from the state hospital for the insane at Napa to the one in Stockton and from there to the one in the Santa Clara Valley called Agnews and there the trail ceased
BTS I was directly under it
BTS Then he returned and took up his burden
BTS What then does the United States get in return from Brazil
BTS Before him was smiling country streaming with sunshine lazy with quietude
BTS Kill or be killed eat or be eaten was the law
BTS Calvin acknowledged
BTS This morning however on entering his state-room to make the bed and put things in order I found him well and hard at work
BTS The railroad knows my business just a little bit better than I do he said
BTS And now they're payin' their respects to each other and tryin' to get clear the red-faced man went on as the hurried whistling ceased
BTS The whole thing was so unlike the Wolf Larsen I had known
BTS These we learned afterward as for example the secret messages of the oligarchs sent with the express purpose of leaking to the ears of the revolutionists that had come over the wires now and again during the first part of the night
BTS And over this great demesne Buck ruled
BTS Hello below
BTS They gave trail to him when he came and went or walked among them and when he asserted his will they obeyed
BTS but still there was about him a suggestion of lurking ferocity as though the Wild still lingered in him and the wolf in him merely slept
BTS For centuries no hint of its existence reached the world
BTS The very negroes that waited on us knew that something terrible was impending
BTS so he chose a new way to intimidate me
BTS Are you going to take the money
BTS He waited
BTS On the sled securely lashed was a long and narrow oblong box
BTS Yes sir Beauty Smith snarled
BTS It does not matter young or old man or woman high or low genius or clod go where one will among the comrades of the Revolution the motor-force will be found to be a great and abiding desire for the right
BTS As Berkeley himself attested his metaphysics didn't work
BTS But the later name sticks
BTS But it was the multiplicity of laws that befuddled White Fang and often brought him into disgrace
BTS The white men came from off these steamers and went away on them again
BTS Don't let him know that we know
BTS But there should be no conflict of interest
BTS I charged the capitalist class with having mismanaged society
BTS though why such a magnificent animal as he should have headaches at all puzzles me
BTS But a portion of this knowledge was quickly to be his
BTS The meaning is that those hundreds and hundreds of millions were part of capital's share which capital did not consume
BTS In San Quentin prison he had proved incorrigible
BTS You tell me that I dream
BTS All things were thawing bending snapping
BTS Knots and ridges and mounds of muscles writhed and bunched under the skin
BTS With the exception of the terrible details Jackson's story of his accident was the same as that I had already heard
BTS And following upon it the teamsters' strike had been broken
BTS He was one of many at dinner and in the drawing-room where we gathered and waited for all to arrive he made a rather incongruous appearance
BTS After a time White Fang heard strange noises approaching
BTS This served to form a large roll in Cherokee's mouth the fur of which well-nigh defied his teeth
BTS Then at the same instant he saw and smelt
BTS You don't understand the game
BTS They rose from their bases hundreds of feet and they were composed of red volcanic earth the famous wine-soil of Sonoma
BTS His muzzle went up his tail stiffened and his nostrils dilated as he scented the air
BTS Spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again and from that moment Buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred
BTS Trap him
BTS Precisely in the way that the door slid back he slid aside and I stepped out on deck
BTS There's nothing can be done on deck
BTS One hand was torn loose from its hold
BTS I remember an early instance of this kind when Wolf Larsen appeared on the scene just as I had begun to give orders
BTS Wickson who sat behind me was unaffected for I heard him sneer aloud Utopian
BTS By the time it was dark wind and sea had become too strong for the boat and I reluctantly took in the sail and set about making a drag or sea-anchor
BTS He did a man's full work in that alone
BTS If part of them escaped the vigilance of the oligarchs might be aroused so as to prevent the escape of the remainder
BTS He sat down to consider listening to the silence of the forest and perturbed by it
BTS If you are braver than I am I more cowardly than you
BTS And their wives are always in and out of each other's houses
BTS When Mit-sah cried out his command for the team to stop White Fang obeyed
BTS It was to this that was fastened the long rope by which he pulled at the sled
BTS Thus I was given to understand that he was the captain the Old Man in the cook's vernacular the individual whom I must interview and put to the trouble of somehow getting me ashore
BTS I made no charges against the men with whom I had talked nor for that matter did I even mention them
BTS He left Sweden when he was eighteen is now thirty-eight and in all the intervening time has not been home once
BTS The table was angry now fighting angry
BTS also the travel pride had gripped him and he purposed to make the record trip of the year
BTS Some Government must protect all these seals
BTS He's got intelligence and we've got to give that intelligence a chance
BTS I looked steadily into the cruel grey eyes
BTS Together they looked at White Fang at the end of his stretched chain bristling snarling ferocious straining to get at the sled-dogs
BTS But in the moment he looked at Lip-lip his hair rose on end all along his back
BTS I've got some pull and I'll see if it can be managed
BTS I hesitated
BTS And each year something happened and I did not go
BTS She was made glad in vague ways by the battle for this was the love-making of the Wild the sex-tragedy of the natural world that was tragedy only to those that died
BTS This is compulsory
BTS I sold my house--my houses rather he said all my other possessions
BTS Numbers of the passengers were leaping overboard
BTS Chapter V
BTS As for Buck wearying of the pursuit he returned to the desolated camp
BTS Like him they were domesticated wolves
BTS The women were afraid
BTS This with the same care he deposited in the gutter
BTS I felt sad unutterably sad
BTS There was no escaping it
BTS Both men were on their knees bending over the dogs
BTS It should have been in its proper place in the rack
BTS He has been too severely touched
BTS much remained to be done and when the Revolt was precipitated of course it was doomed to failure
BTS Men despaired of matching him with an equal and Beauty Smith was compelled to pit wolves against him
BTS and in my choice To reign is worth ambition though in hell Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven
BTS Running off before the wind with everything to starboard he came about and returned close-hauled on the port tack
BTS Conditions favoured the undertaking
BTS I hardly think you'll care to sacrifice the Dean of American Letters the Second he sneered
BTS Ad 'is fingers around it but I pulled it through cuttin' to the bone
BTS At a calculation of a two-mile drift per hour during the seventy and odd hours of the storm we had been driven at least one hundred and fifty miles to the north-east
BTS I felt again the pulse of his palm on mine the touch of his lips
BTS Though the grizzled old fellow could see only on one side against the youth and vigour of the other he brought into play the wisdom of long years of experience
BTS The sneer was wholly in his voice
BTS Spitz was a practised fighter
BTS He knew the breed and he gave his advice in the certainty that it would not be followed
BTS His body leaned forward from the hips
BTS Kiche
BTS We shall go clear I said with a confidence which I knew deceived neither of us
BTS This man good at heart but with a ferocious animalism close at the surface of his being lying in jail and expectant of nothing less than death was prevailed upon by the agents of the Iron Heel to throw the bomb in the House of Representatives
BTS Ah now we come to the gist of the matter Ernest said with a pleased expression
BTS Pike made painful efforts
BTS By cunning operations on tongue throat larynx and nasal cavities a man's whole enunciation and manner of speech could be changed
BTS Van Weyden
BTS The boy pursued him and he a stranger in the village fled between two tepees to find himself cornered against a high earth bank
BTS but while a surgeon checked the bleeding he prowled up and down growling furiously attempting to rush in and being forced back by an array of hostile clubs
BTS Wolf just wolf 'tis what he is
BTS Meynell
BTS One of the hunters a tall loose-jointed chap named Henderson was going aft at the time from the steerage the name the hunters facetiously gave their midships sleeping quarters to the cabin
BTS Never mind what's up he answered gruffly
BTS The sun of the small capitalists is setting
BTS The boat had lain there for a long time for it was half filled with sand and the splintered wood had that weather-worn appearance due to long exposure to the elements
BTS A soft light suffused his face and his eyes glistened as though somewhere in the deeps of his being his ancestors had quickened and stirred with dim memories of tips received in former lives
BTS He refused to take into consideration what I was or rather what my life and the things I was accustomed to had been
BTS and his eyes were restless fluttering here there and everywhere and refusing to meet mine
BTS Nope
BTS It'll all come right in the end
BTS There lay the Ghost bow on to the beach her splintered bowsprit projecting over the sand her tangled spars rubbing against her side to the lift of the crooning waves
BTS drowned his voice and he stood disdainfully till the din had somewhat subsided
BTS I felt quite amused at his unwarranted choler and while he stumped indignantly up and down I fell to dwelling upon the romance of the fog
BTS It bit to the marrow
BTS White Fang clung with his fore-paws to the man's shoulders at the same time burying his fangs into the back of the man's neck
BTS False
BTS Ha
BTS He nodded his head again evincing even greater satisfaction than before
BTS But she was right
BTS The oligarchs themselves were going through a remarkable and it must be confessed unexpected development
BTS This man who endowed chairs in universities and erected magnificent chapels perjured himself in courts of law over dollars and cents
BTS The impression to be made on the minds of the Chicago comrades was that the general Revolt was beginning albeit with a confusing miscarriage in many details
BTS I got hold of Percy Layton
BTS I noticed the lips slightly move Maud said
BTS In order to make the exhibition interesting he was kept in a rage most of the time
BTS This is the beginning
BTS At first I could make out nothing
BTS Get into yer bunks now and shut yer faces
BTS We are braver I hastened to say
BTS I tell you right now Henry that critter's the cause of all our trouble
BTS We saw the police disappearing down the cross-streets on the run and knew that something terrible was coming
BTS Teek followed
BTS Won't you
BTS Ernest queried
BTS Hal guided at the gee-pole and Charles stumbled along in the rear
BTS And you feel well
BTS Never
BTS I was groping into his soul-stuff as he made a practice of groping in the soul-stuff of others
BTS They woke me up with their barking or I'd be sleeping yet
BTS Such rooms were museums entailing endless labor to keep clean
BTS And in her zeal when she had finished with her own she attacked the belongings of her men and went through them like a tornado
BTS His wife was in ill health and he was unable to earn by his rattan-work and peddling sufficient food for the family
BTS I ran to the windlass
BTS Why should you
BTS But the three days' rest was good in spite of it all for it had given my knee the very chance it needed
BTS Forgotten already were the vanquished rivals and the love-tale red-written on the snow
BTS Straight toward the square hole of the step the square butt descended
BTS The latter's cap came off after the custom of the sea and he stood respectfully in the centre of the cabin swaying heavily and uneasily to the roll of the schooner and facing the captain
BTS only could be seen a pair of eyes gleaming like live coals
BTS Then Francois's lash descended and Buck had the satisfaction of watching Spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the teams
BTS He had done this thing before somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world and he was doing it again now running free in the open the unpacked earth underfoot the wide sky overhead
BTS And now at this late date nothing remains but for the affair to take its place among the mysteries of history
BTS Kowalt pondered and shook his head
BTS Thinking that he was asleep and wishing him to escape reprimand or worse I spoke to him
BTS By the time Cassiar Bar was reached he was so weak that he was falling repeatedly in the traces
BTS We were now alongside and foaming past
BTS and in fact was the backbone of the town giving employment to hundreds of men and women
BTS easy as she goes Wolf Larsen finally said
BTS For some reason though I know not why in the argument so utterly had I lost it in the contemplation of one stray brown lock of Maud's hair he quoted from Iseult at Tintagel where she says Blessed am I beyond women even herein That beyond all born women is my sin And perfect my transgression
BTS What you and the mate there are going to do to me sir
BTS He stood where he had arisen opened his mouth and broke out the long heart-broken puppy wail
BTS I could not collect my thoughts
BTS He called up his reserves of strength and gained his feet
BTS she objected
BTS Collie snarled warningly at him and he was careful to keep his distance
BTS Thinkin' what
BTS Let me see your hand
BTS A third of God's angels he had led with him and straightway he incited man to rebel against God and gained for himself and hell the major portion of all the generations of man
BTS Sleep-walking sunstroke what
BTS There is no discussion
BTS And now that they're gone 'tis revenge for my blasted manhood I'm after
BTS We have never got the slightest clew to his identity
BTS Every one here except me is hanging on your lips for that answer
BTS He cast anxious glances at his mate but she showed no desire to get up
BTS He made no reply at first but on my repeating the question he answered No no
BTS Poor devil Scott murmured pityingly
BTS And so we loved and were happy
BTS Kowalt spoke up
BTS It was like Fate itself and as inexorable
BTS It was there in the fibre of his being
BTS I've been in orspital arf my bleedin' life
BTS I just wanted you to know it was me he said in the darkness
BTS He made no noise
BTS It is my wretched nerves
BTS I glanced up
BTS Her wit was playing keenly and she was enjoying the tilt as much as Wolf Larsen and he was enjoying it hugely
BTS In the same way he resented his mother being tied with a stick even though it was done by the superior man-animals
BTS It moved with commingled mistrust and daring cautiously observing the men its attention fixed on the dogs
BTS Hal and his sister and brother-in-law listened unwillingly pitched tent and overhauled the outfit
BTS I did not see the expedite fall when he cut it loose
BTS What was to happen I knew no more than did I know what had happened
BTS Later on when the overtures became more insistent White Fang bristled and bared his teeth and backed away
BTS Yet you feel the pressure of other combinations on you the trust combinations and you cry out
BTS It took the place of like which latter had been the highest feeling that thrilled him in his intercourse with the gods
BTS Yes sir was the meek reply as the offending head disappeared into the galley
BTS But he gave no sign of pain and with his single right hand helped us lash the boat in its place
BTS he asked
BTS Bishop Morehouse was leaning forward and listening intently
BTS The cub could not understand
BTS His brain worked in dim ways
BTS For two days and nights Buck never left camp never let Thornton out of his sight
BTS For to play a system requires money while the wages of a gardener's helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny
BTS A week later Wickson got back his shoes
BTS Ernest insisted
BTS The ignorance evidenced by the business men at the dinner was nothing unusual
BTS And love was the plummet dropped down into the deeps of him where like had never gone
BTS He whittled and listened gave monosyllabic replies and when it was asked terse advice
BTS Eh
BTS You can't do it
BTS These quarrels were very common in those irrational and anarchic times
BTS But after the lynx all fighting ceased for White Fang
BTS It was a savage land the men were savage and the fights were usually to the death
BTS The sailor Johnson was steering
BTS And while Japan dreamed of continental empire and strove to realize the dream she suppressed her own proletarian revolution
BTS They are glazing
BTS I know what I shall do to-morrow the first thing run out a light anchor and kedge the schooner off the beach
BTS You must stand off from him Matthewson protested
BTS He had got for himself a hoof and part of the shin-bone to which quite a bit of meat was attached
BTS He carried himself with pride as though forsooth he had achieved a deed praiseworthy and meritorious
BTS I cried out overcome with the horror of it
BTS it was that fabled sixth sense which conveyed to him the loom and feel of an object close at hand
BTS But Wolf Larsen leaving his victim for the moment and with one of his tremendous springs gained my side and flung me into the far corner of the cabin
BTS while the adventures toward the far white wall ceased altogether
BTS She was arrested and arraigned for insanity
BTS In that day when you speak of rising in your strength your strength would be turned against yourself
BTS An eternity of piggishness
BTS Wolf Larsen was too wise for that and besides they had no adequate weapons
BTS One night there was a heavy snowfall and in the morning Pike the malingerer did not appear
BTS The suck of the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was frightful and Thornton knew that the shore was impossible
BTS And thereafter I lived nightmare
BTS But to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck shutting off his breath
BTS I wish to be put ashore I said firmly for I now had myself in control
BTS And yet we had thousands of our agents among them
BTS Jim Hall believed that the judge knew all about it and was hand in glove with the police in the perpetration of the monstrous injustice
BTS They sensed between themselves and him a difference of kind cause sufficient in itself for hostility
BTS an inch
BTS I warned you before about it
BTS There is no validity to your conclusions
BTS Another day a full-grown wolf fresh-caught from the Wild was shoved in through the door of the pen
BTS These Fighting groups were modelled somewhat after the Fighting Organization of the Russian Revolution and despite the unceasing efforts of the Iron Heel these groups persisted throughout the three centuries of its existence
BTS And then so strange was the dream there was a crash
BTS As I dragged the mattress out of the bunk it seemed to disintegrate in mid-air at the same time bursting into flames
BTS He was a gloomy morose fellow and he showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone and further that there would be trouble if he were not left alone
BTS Maud Brewster and I scarcely touched the food before us gazing instead in silent anxiety at each other and listening to Wolf Larsen's voice which easily penetrated the cabin through the intervening bulkhead
BTS A great fear came upon him
BTS Something had happened
BTS To give point to unending pursuit of the leader Mit-sah favoured him over the other dogs
BTS No agent of the Iron Heel was executed without a trial
BTS At such times Buck did not attempt to stay him but loped easily at his heels satisfied with the way the game was played lying down when the moose stood still attacking him fiercely when he strove to eat or drink
BTS Suppose the United States disposes of its surplus to a country with undeveloped resources like say Brazil
BTS But he was not to be caught napping this time
BTS And then abruptly the newspapers and the critical magazines ceased saying anything about the book at all
BTS Her plates are scarred by the sun dear lass And her ropes are taut with the dew For we're booming down on the old trail our own trail the out trail We're sagging south on the Long Trail the trail that is always new
BTS Using the sled-lashing for a heaving rope and with the aid of the dogs he hoisted the coffin to the top of the scaffold
BTS Thus it was that the hunt of White Fang became their chief game a deadly game withal and at all times a serious game
BTS No it is a palace wherein there are many servants
BTS She compromised however by taking upon herself the lighter labours of cooking and gathering driftwood and moss for our winter's supply
BTS I don't know
BTS ' And yet again not only is your small combination not a trust but you are aware yourself of its lack of strength
BTS Because he ran at the end of the longest rope the dogs had always the view of him running away before them
BTS You would be drafted into the militia
BTS In the terrible wolf-struggle of those centuries no man was permanently safe no matter how much wealth he amassed
BTS In return it was argued by the prosecution that the weakness of the bomb was a blunder on the part of the socialists just as its premature explosion caused by Ernest's losing his nerve and dropping it was a blunder
BTS The crack of the rifle of the soldier sitting beside me made me open my eyes and I saw George Milford whom I had known in the Pell Street days sinking slowly down to the sidewalk
BTS We do everything to make our guests feel at home eh Mr
BTS As usual I had underrated the amount of work involved in this portion of the task and two long days were necessary to complete it
BTS They send them to jail
BTS To show the tenor of thought the following definition is quoted from The Cynic's Word Book 1906 A
BTS PART III CHAPTER I THE MAKERS OF FIRE The cub came upon it suddenly
BTS There were no dairymen only a Milk Trust
BTS CHAPTER XXXVIII I think my left side is going Wolf Larsen wrote the morning after his attempt to fire the ship
BTS Our boasted civilization is based upon blood soaked in blood and neither you nor I nor any of us can escape the scarlet stain
BTS Hammerfield and Dr
BTS Procuring their rifles they opened fire in a leisurely manner upon the deserters
BTS You have no souls to be influenced
BTS As I rounded the galley a new satisfaction was mine at thought of all the splendid cooking utensils inside
BTS For three days Perrault and Francois threw chests up and down the main street of Skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink while the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of dog-busters and mushers
BTS And there came a day when the hawk's shadow did not drive him crouching into the bushes
BTS He is not feeling very well
BTS And it shall be done by power
BTS All right he said
BTS The mate Johansen stood away several feet to the side of him and fully three yards in front of him sat Wolf Larsen on one of the pivotal cabin chairs
BTS Wolf Larsen made the same demand of the sailors
BTS It restrained him opposed the will of him toward personal liberty
BTS White Fang listening to the wordy war and watching the angry gestures knew that his act was justified
BTS No woman was eligible for membership who had not lost near relatives at the hands of the Oligarchy
BTS the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent
BTS And the same with all the other unions outside the combination
BTS But just think of how much smaller I shall be before I die
BTS Thus had White Fang never come in to the fires of man the Wild would have moulded him into a true wolf
BTS ' he said
BTS The seal of his dependence on man had been set upon him in that early day when he turned his back on the Wild and crawled to Grey Beaver's feet to receive the expected beating
BTS The source of the smoke must be very close to Wolf Larsen my mind was made up to this and I went straight to his bunk
BTS He was unafraid of the wild
BTS The smoke of the Macedonia had dwindled to a dim blot on the north-eastern horizon
BTS I crept through the store to the front
BTS Smoke the irrepressible related a story and they descended into the steerage bellowing with laughter
BTS and besides whatever new situation arose it could not possibly be worse than the present one
BTS Here was no meat nothing but a threatening and inedible silence
BTS No coffee I said regretfully passing her buttered sea-biscuits and a slice of canned tongue
BTS White Fang near the corner of the cabin and forty feet away was snarling with blood-curdling viciousness not at Scott but at the dog-musher
BTS The basic life of him dominated him again and his intelligence fled before the will of his flesh to live
BTS Louis demanded with Celtic fire
BTS Here the cub lost momentum
BTS He gave no sign did not even snarl but turned and followed after White Fang
BTS The line is thick with them
BTS eight hundred just as he stands
BTS The rest of his mates though lighter dogs had relatively lost more weight than he
BTS He was a good worker an' never made trouble
BTS Hump he said at last I must get into my bunk
BTS It was a nauseous mess ship's coffee but the heat of it was revivifying
BTS Not alone out of his own eyes but out of the eyes of all his ancestors was the cub now looking upon man out of eyes that had circled in the darkness around countless winter camp-fires that had peered from safe distances and from the hearts of thickets at the strange two-legged animal that was lord over living things
BTS They did not want their men to go forth to die
BTS I can never bring myself to recognize anything else as valid
BTS They're not our comrades he shouted in my ear
BTS Frankly he has one chance in a thousand announced the surgeon after he had worked an hour and a half on White Fang
BTS But you are afraid you are afraid
BTS Beauty Smith had regained his feet and come over to look at White Fang
BTS Each day the sun rose earlier and set later
BTS But think Humphrey
BTS As he bent his head carelessly to smell it White Fang bristled slightly
BTS All eyes centred upon him
BTS I'll tell you
BTS His voice was less harsh and wholly sincere as he said You must be happy you sentimentalists really and truly happy at dreaming and finding things good and because you find some of them good feeling good yourself
BTS He was warm-blooded passionate emotional
BTS Pertonwaithe
BTS yet his mental vision was not wide enough to embrace the other bank of the Mackenzie
BTS With a groan of pain he threw himself into a doorway
BTS Both from his father the wolf and from Kiche he had inherited stature and strength and already he was measuring up alongside the full-grown dogs
BTS Dawn was breaking through the windows and dimming the electric lights
BTS In part the decision read There is no reasonable ground for interfering with the liberty of persons or the right of free contract by determining the hours of labor in the occupation of a baker
BTS But Lip-lip had lived his life in camp and had fought many puppy fights
BTS but it was without power
BTS Descendants of these original colonists were for a while inordinately proud of their genealogy
BTS I think that he is a better man than you are I answered impelled somehow with a desire to draw upon myself a portion of the wrath I felt was about to break upon his head
BTS And when Beauty Smith left him tied outside the fort he knew that it was Beauty Smith's will that he should remain there
BTS Scott cried out sharply with surprise catching his torn hand and holding it tightly in his other hand
BTS But Matt's hand went limp in the other's grasp as his gaze shot past and remained fixed on something behind him
BTS 'You might give me back my home' I said 'and my stock in the Sierra Mills
BTS For sure
BTS But we did not have to wait long and the problem solved itself
BTS Her face was white and set
BTS The mate was the first but mark me words there'll be more dead men before the trip is done with
BTS Varying were the emotions that surged through him
BTS But he did not run his best in this chase
BTS A whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils and there curled up under the snow in a snug ball lay Billee
BTS He dropped his head to the scale and resumed the copying
BTS He called it a tonic
BTS Wainwright the hunter whom Wolf Larsen had stolen with boat and men took advantage of the veiled sea and escaped
BTS He spoke at length and his conclusion was greeted with a wild roar of cheers
BTS A bleakness came into his eyes and the lines of his mouth grew severe and harsh
BTS So it was when we moved to San Francisco into four wretched rooms in the slum south of Market Street that he embarked upon the adventure with the joy and enthusiasm of a child--combined with the clear sight and mental grasp of an extraordinary intellect
BTS Squirrels were chattering birds singing and overhead honked the wild-fowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the air
BTS You have no proof
BTS He was fainting
BTS it is the means to power and power is governmental
BTS Everhard
BTS Always my meditations led me back to him
BTS After that came a kindly blank
BTS Then I noticed the twinkle in his eyes
BTS Christ told the rich young man to sell all he had Ernest said bitterly
BTS for goodness' sake Maud demanded
BTS Bread and butter silks and jewels dollars and cents and incidentally the closing up of the overland trade-routes to India were the things that caused the voyages of discovery
BTS Let us not destroy those wonderful machines that produce efficiently and cheaply
BTS The horse stood saddled and waiting at the door
BTS Suddenly they saw its back end drop down as into a rut and the gee-pole with Hal clinging to it jerk into the air
BTS He took all manner of risks resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from dim dawn to dark
BTS Maud could not stand nor had I strength to carry her
BTS Dreaming to leave footprints on the sands of time
BTS Then it was that his lips half writhed into a snarl and the hair of his neck and shoulders involuntarily bristled while he half crouched for a spring his claws spasmodically clutching into the snow-surface for firmer footing
BTS He came down a shelving bank to the stream
BTS As for the host of labor it has been in the dirt since history began and I read history aright
BTS The superiority of these man-animals increased with every moment
BTS I have a counter proposition to make and for the good of your soul
BTS Send those two men aft Mr
BTS She was not frightened but appalled rather at the human animality of it
BTS He heard again the intimidating cry and at the same instant received a sharp blow on the side of the neck and felt the sharp teeth of the mother-weasel cut into his flesh
BTS Through the cracks in the bottom of the upper bunk he had set fire to the mattress
BTS Then you don't believe in altruism
BTS nothing remains but a bloody revolution of the working class
BTS But this socialism of yours is a dream Mr
BTS and here I was in no fit condition for the rough life in prospect
BTS We were the first of his old friends he had met since his disappearance he told us
BTS Rest
BTS But in the face of it he was indomitable
BTS And the cub felt that somehow he had escaped a great hurt
BTS I had been resting all my life and did not know it
BTS The mental processes of the man with whom one disagrees are always wrong
BTS Buck simply smothered him by virtue of superior weight and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to whine for mercy
BTS It beat steadily and strong and was quite normal
BTS Because the politicians of the old parties will have nothing to do with your atavistic ideas
BTS It was a careless unpremeditated glance one of those haphazard things men do when they have no immediate call to do anything in particular but act because they are alive and must do something
BTS White Fang went wild with rage
BTS What is so dreadfully vicious and worthless in our method of thinking young man
BTS I suppose you're like Mr
BTS This is directly in line with the fact that the bomb was lightly charged and that its explosion at Everhard's feet was not deadly
BTS It was strange meat different from any she had ever brought before
BTS The railroad might just as well have owned my quarry and hired me to run it
BTS Several hundred men furred and mittened banked around the sled within easy distance
BTS Their common reply was that they were glad of the opportunity to make it perfectly plain that no premium would ever be put on carelessness by them
BTS This man had saved his life which was something
BTS Thenceforward he would be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows spears and clubs
BTS His hair bristled involuntarily
BTS The man who had taken Mugridge's place had evidently joined his comrades in the forecastle
BTS You damn beasts
BTS I queried a moment later after having rowed a few more strokes along the beach
BTS Hands were ripping and tearing at my flesh and garments
BTS the Almighty hath not built Here for his envy
BTS Yet his dominant nature asserted itself and he had first to thrash them into an acknowledgment of his superiority and leadership
BTS The worst appeared inevitable
BTS Here goes
BTS Who knows
BTS His eyes roved everywhere and they were filled with apprehension and dread
BTS And yet I aver it and I aver it again I was unafraid
BTS Ernest's continued presence in Berkeley by the way was accounted for by the fact that he was taking special courses in biology at the university and also that he was hard at work on a new book entitled Philosophy and Revolution
BTS There was need for haste
BTS He had never seen such a dog before
BTS Here in the running stream where ice was beginning to form he hid his trail
BTS At this moment speech came to White Fang rushing up in a great burst of barking
BTS That part of capital's unconsumed share bought back the bonds
BTS This is the revolution my masters
BTS It's long years I've worked in the mills
BTS His father and mother lived wholly upon meat
BTS If I tried to enter your father's house at night to steal his dividends from the Sierra Mills what would he do
BTS I was among the missing dead of the Martinez disaster an unrecovered body
BTS My curiosity burst from me in a flood of speech
BTS They're always having whist parties and such things back and forth
BTS Beaten on their chosen field they were ripe to seek revenge by means of political action
BTS I became suspicious
BTS the Black Hundreds appearing in scores of wide-scattered places had destroyed property
BTS 'Tis old fat Louis I stand by an' trouble enough it'll be
BTS By eleven o'clock the sea had become glass
BTS He did not know why but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of impending calamity
BTS No she didn't eat him
BTS Very creditable very creditable Dr
BTS Look 'ere 'Ump he began a malicious light in his eyes and a snarl in his throat
BTS No mass-plays here
BTS He rolled toward it grovelled toward it fell toward it when he was knocked down
BTS Also he explained that there were many accidents in the mills and that the company's policy was to fight to the bitter end all consequent damage suits
BTS Possibly there is a station ashore
BTS I repeated the question
BTS If you do not now point out a flaw in my definition you are disqualified later on from advancing metaphysical arguments
BTS Labor was bloody and sullen but crushed
BTS Both nose and tongue had been scorched by the live thing sun-coloured that had grown up under Grey Beaver's hands
BTS It followed down after him pressing more closely against him
BTS One thing was plain Jackson's situation was wretched
BTS I bustled about in quite housewifely fashion procuring soothing lotions for her sunburn raiding Wolf Larsen's private stores for a bottle of port I knew to be there and directing Thomas Mugridge in the preparation of the spare state-room
BTS The quotation here follows About ten years ago Rockefeller's income was given as thirty millions by an excellent authority
BTS It is not the way of the Wild to like movement
BTS One of the onlookers who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot speech now spoke up  It's not that I care a whoop what becomes of you but for the dogs' sakes I just want to tell you you can help them a mighty lot by breaking out that sled
BTS By convulsive efforts he got on his feet staggered and fell
BTS It was always in the way he was averring while Hartman was talking back to him and with fitting secret-service pride explaining to him the clumsiness of the police
BTS He had never seen a dog go mad nor did he have any reason to fear madness
BTS You know nothing was his rude reply
BTS History was making fast
BTS Could this then be the firm-poised Christ-like man I had known with pure limpid eyes and a gaze steady and unfaltering as his soul
BTS Grey Beaver was busy trading and getting wealthy
BTS At last at the end of the fourth day he pulled the great moose down
BTS Thick banks in the north and north-west
BTS but Collie was very much perplexed and worried whining and restless outraged by the permitted presence of this wolf and confident that the gods were making a mistake
BTS Now and again a pair of eyes moved or disappeared to appear again a moment later
BTS Great
BTS Never in my life had food been so welcome
BTS Then their noses touched and he felt the warm little tongue of the puppy on his jowl
BTS And you
BTS How fast is she ebbin'
BTS This scheme was eminently successful
BTS It was Buck a live hurricane of fury hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy
BTS Then he woke up
BTS His voice grew strong and confident and it glowed as he glowed and as the thoughts glowed that poured out from him
BTS Yet we spend as freely as you was Maud Brewster's contribution
BTS And there were many similar men owners or part-owners in small factories small businesses and small industries--small capitalists in short
BTS that they are hatched out by the sun like turtle eggs or receive life in some similar and sordid fashion
BTS Listen to that will you
BTS High up on the beach of the second cove from ours we discovered the splintered wreck of a boat a sealer's boat for the rowlocks were bound in sennit a gun-rack was on the starboard side of the bow and in white letters was faintly visible Gazelle No
BTS The lips were full yet possessed of the firmness almost harshness which is characteristic of thin lips
BTS It is true that we want to destroy the trusts in order that our profits may remain to us
BTS The Bishop was silent and for once Ernest forbore to press the point
BTS A shrill and minute singing stole upon his hearing
BTS Please
BTS I was afraid of them
BTS It was the mandate of his instinct that that head must be free
BTS John Thornton was dead
BTS Nothing happened
BTS Likewise he learned to romp with the master to be tumbled down and rolled over and be the victim of innumerable rough tricks
BTS so White Fang prepared to meet him in a friendly spirit
BTS He turned to Ernest
BTS Now he was upon it
BTS But the refuge was very near
BTS Thomas Mugridge routed me out at half-past five much in the fashion that Bill Sykes must have routed out his dog
BTS The value of life
BTS In a hazy way I saw and heard men rushing and shouting as they strove to lower the boats
BTS With the arrival of a steamer the fun began
BTS But they went away with vengeance unsatisfied
BTS He saw Spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing
BTS They knew more about the ways of the Southland gods than did he and in their eyes he had qualified when he accompanied the gods inside the house
BTS No one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard on what Buck imagined was merely a stroll
BTS Burton and O'Sullivan were in it
BTS Pertonwaithe
BTS I was famished but Maud tried vainly to get me to eat
BTS There is nothing left for us but the open boat
BTS The condition of the people of the abyss was pitiable
BTS Her eyes fell before his gaze but she lifted them again and defiantly to mine
BTS I can't he said I must be going
BTS In truth many of our comrades toiled at making beautiful those same palaces and wonder-cities
BTS Nothing is sacred to him nothing is too terrible for him to do
BTS yet White Fang learned to face them fiercely belligerent and unafraid
BTS Candidly I do not know I strove to reassure her
BTS In the time before he was made leader of the team the pack had learned to get out of his way
BTS There all young men must be in the army
BTS Wherefore is there in him little dog and much wolf
BTS I'm repairing her was my answer
BTS It was the poor hunted wretch that had dragged himself past my hiding-place
BTS The Macedonia's third weather boat was being attacked by two of ours the fourth by our remaining three
BTS Buck had been purposely placed between Dave and Sol-leks so that he might receive instruction
BTS That it was intrinsically valuable was a truism I had never questioned
BTS Ah it was sweet in my ears
BTS But Weedon Scott did not agree with his father
BTS The return of the love-master was enough
BTS Colonel Van Gilbert was subtly facetious in his introduction of the social reformer and member of the working class and the audience smiled
BTS Again I went below
BTS the cook cried
BTS but a revolutionist I became and I was plunged into a whirl of happenings that would have been inconceivable three short months before
BTS There was no fan-formation of the team
BTS He had the mind and the soul that only great men have
BTS I'll show you something that isn't a dream then Ernest answered
BTS but the masters the hunters and the captain were heartlessly indifferent
BTS A couple of hundred feet in length and width it was half of that in depth
BTS Wolf Larsen
BTS I said to Wolf Larsen
BTS As I have said in the masculine sense his was a beautiful face
BTS They were active
BTS Here the sea was calm save for a heavy but smooth ground-swell and I took in the sea-anchor and began to row
BTS It was colossal stunning
BTS It would have meant terrible times and great loss of life but no revolutionist hesitates at such things
BTS You know you only mean that in relation to human life for of the flesh and the fowl and the fish you destroy as much as I or any other man
BTS Late next morning Buck led the long team up the street
BTS He plunged about in their very midst tearing rending destroying in constant and terrific motion which defied the arrows they discharged at him
BTS He kept Francois busy for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take place sooner or later
BTS Her hysteria became violent and she was helped weeping and laughing out of the room
BTS Twenty-four hours had passed since he had slashed open the hand that was now bandaged and held up by a sling to keep the blood out of it
BTS And the young man the son talked with me much about people and work and the robbery of the people by the capitalists
BTS and patched shortened and distorted they were a ridiculously ill-fitting suit for so trim a craft as the Ghost
BTS I asked
BTS Well have I convinced you
BTS A pause seemed to fall
BTS Fastening one end of a heavy tackle to the windlass and with the other end fast to the butt of the foretopmast I began to heave
BTS I simply could not stand upright and endure the agony
BTS As he turned his agonized face up to me I recognized him as Joseph Hurd
BTS The mountains and waste regions were filled with outlaws and refugees who were being hunted down mercilessly
BTS well a dream
BTS His shirt had been ripped entirely from him in the struggle and blood from a gash in the cheek was flowing down his naked chest marking a red path across his white thigh and dripping to the floor
BTS I told Weedon that I was afraid the warm climate would not agree with an Arctic animal
BTS Perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent than those he had brought in
BTS Go below and fill a sack with coal
BTS But the question is How do they club them
BTS All he could hope for all he sought was some hole to crawl away in and hide like any animal
BTS I could not lift him directly into a bunk but with Maud's help I lifted first his shoulders and head then his body balanced him across the edge and rolled him into a lower bunk
BTS and by the time I had compressed the severed veins and arteries the sailors were singing and heaving in the offending monster
BTS Behind what he said were the same nameless formless things that I feel
BTS Nor was my knee any better
BTS But with milk two cents higher I should think you could have competed Ernest suggested slyly
BTS He lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet
BTS His masterfulness delighted me and terrified me for my fancies wantonly roved until I found myself considering him as a lover as a husband
BTS But it's to trouble he'll come with Wolf Larsen as the sparks fly upward
BTS The wholesale jail delivery did not occur until well along into 1915
BTS Calvin sat in uncomfortable silence
BTS And you
BTS Its voting strength in the United States in 1888 was 2068
BTS Debs national leader of the American socialists at the time the following words The labor leaders that cannot be bribed nor bullied must be ambushed and murdered
BTS He shook his head dolefully lighted his cigarette and sat down beside me
BTS Also the three days' rest brought the trouble I had foreseen
BTS His excuse for being aboard was that he was drunk when he signed
BTS I did not see it myself but my assistants first one and then the other deserted me for a few moments to run amidships and look at what was going on
BTS You caught me feeding his lambs you know
BTS They contain more valuable political economy than is to be found in most of the books
BTS Please she managed to whisper and I could but obey
BTS To labour at living and be unpaid is worse than to be dead
BTS At such moments panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes fixed upon the big bull it appeared to Buck that a change was coming over the face of things
BTS Nothing mattered
BTS It might have been otherwise and he would then have been otherwise
BTS Maud's footsteps were very near as his hand fluttered for the last time and my throat was released
BTS Starting from a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire a dispute which concerned only Charles and Hal presently would be lugged in the rest of the family fathers mothers uncles cousins people thousands of miles away and some of them dead
BTS To complete the deception an extra plate was laid and when we sat down to table one chair was not occupied
BTS I'm Garthwaite
BTS One-quarter of this cent came to us
BTS This other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm with muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and swelling
BTS Several times Wolf Larsen tried to inveigle me into discussion but I gave him short answers and eluded him
BTS At harness-up time he tried to crawl to his driver
BTS This was a different proposition from crouching in frozen fear while the unknown lurked just alongside
BTS Whether you do or think you do it's the same thing
BTS They died easily in their beds--sickness you see one time and another
BTS 'Tis him that'll put the fear of God in their rotten black hearts
BTS White Fang did not reason it out did not in his mind make the sharp generalisation that the white gods were more powerful
BTS They went sullenly but they went
BTS It was a dark and evil-appearing thing that hut not fit for aught better than swine in a civilized land
BTS But at the sight of him the five men did not spring to their feet nor show their teeth nor snarl
BTS And when they came to close quarters and he had been beaten back by the club he went on growling and snarling and showing his fangs
BTS He closed his hand upon it squeezed and the potato squirted out between his fingers in mushy streams
BTS We'll send you to Congress and it will be all right they told him at one of our secret meetings
BTS Then he began to whine
BTS She is suffering from want of it
BTS All around the horizon are pale fleecy clouds never changing never moving like a silver setting for the flawless turquoise sky
BTS Looks for all the world like a big husky sled-dog Bill said
BTS The wind was favourable and I had thought to tow them back under sail but the wind baffled then died away and our progress with the oars was a snail's pace
BTS This because he considered that they were likewise possessions of the master
BTS As he arose he lowered his crossed arms exposing the bestial face of Beauty Smith
BTS They had worked the trip out with a pencil so much to a dog so many dogs so many days Q
BTS Two were members of the Fighting Groups and the third Grace Holbrook entered a group the following year and six months later was executed by the Iron Heel
BTS Quite true
BTS It was a matter of vital importance that brought me there that night
BTS There was the organization of the mouth-to-mouth propaganda
BTS You have convinced me of your sincerity she said with a faint smile
BTS CHAPTER XXVI Wolf Larsen took the distribution of the whisky off my hands and the bottles began to make their appearance while I worked over the fresh batch of wounded men in the forecastle
BTS If you will wait please until I come back I answered
BTS His love partook of the nature of worship dumb inarticulate a silent adoration
BTS Hand-clapping and roars of laughter from the hunters greeted the exploit while Mugridge eluding half of his pursuers at the foremast ran aft and through the remainder like a runner on the football field
BTS Then Ernest answered you and labor and all of us will be crushed under the iron heel of a despotism as relentless and terrible as any despotism that has blackened the pages of the history of man
BTS He's bound to go on living somewhere somehow
BTS I remember his putting his hand up to feel of the wound on his head and my watching the biceps move like a living thing under its white sheath
BTS Get the cards Hump Wolf Larsen ordered as they took seats at the table
BTS I cannot move arm or leg
BTS Johnson was telling me about her in a short chat I had with him during yesterday's second dog-watch
BTS Nor can I quite close my ears to a small voice of pride which tells me I did not do so badly all things considered
BTS ' He was certainly serious--a twinge of ossified conscience or something
BTS Pacing back and forth the length of the hatchways and savagely chewing the end of a cigar was the man whose casual glance had rescued me from the sea
BTS But it is not that
BTS A vague sound came to our ears like the bubbling of a gigantic caldron a long way off and Hartman said it was machine-guns and automatic rifles
BTS I was not very strong
BTS And the marvel of it was that still he lived and clung to life
BTS Time and again he was cornered and the thing repeated though he was in poor condition or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him
BTS His development or retrogression was rapid
BTS Her mate had slowly relaxed from his crouch and was watching her
BTS What did it matter
BTS Then you must have talked in your sleep she smiled
BTS John D
BTS The governors of Colorado and Idaho are but executing the mandates of their masters the Plutocracy
BTS He was sprawling through solidity
BTS When all was arranged snugly she said Now sir to bed
BTS His head dropped forward on the table and was buried in his hands
BTS He was a beardless young fellow a cadet evidently of some great oligarch family
BTS Among the travellers in my Pullman was comrade Hartman like myself in the secret service of the Iron Heel
BTS One foot was descending into the opening while the other foot was just on the verge of beginning the uplift
BTS You poor devil said John Thornton and Buck licked his hand
BTS The Oligarchy was about to strike
BTS By means of a secondary tackle I had attached to the shears I swung the boom to a nearly perpendicular position then lowered the butt to the deck where to prevent slipping I spiked great cleats around it
BTS Even the big beating given him in his puppyhood by Grey Beaver was mild compared with this
BTS But it was his concern that they leave him alone in his isolation get out of his way when he elected to walk among them and at all times acknowledge his mastery over them
BTS We found that when labor had consumed to the full extent of its wages and when capital had consumed all it wanted there was still left an unconsumed surplus
BTS I thought of the ship's stores and the lazarette beneath the cabin and the idea came to me of surprising Maud with something nice for breakfast
BTS The trusts did not advertise
BTS but I considered and refrained
BTS Henry I was a-thinkin' what a blame sight luckier he is than you an' me'll ever be
BTS Later on in the galley I noticed that his ear was bruised and swollen
BTS An' Ol' Villan cried like a baby
BTS Henry Bill went on
BTS Upon the whole then whether we consult the Jewish policy instituted by God himself or the uniform opinion and practice of mankind in all ages or the injunctions of the New Testament and the moral law we are brought to the conclusion that slavery is not immoral
BTS Somehow I who have always had expression lacked expression when with Wolf Larsen
BTS I had thought they were to live in
BTS He was knocked about like a shuttlecock until finally like Johnson he was beaten and kicked as he lay helpless on the deck
BTS We've got to get out of this
BTS If that pack ever starts to jump you them three cartridges'd be wuth no more'n three whoops in hell
BTS I picked up hope at the thought and put the order swiftly into execution
BTS The unseen ferry-boat was blowing blast after blast and the mouth-blown horn was tooting in terror-stricken fashion
BTS Incidentally the sled went faster and thus by cunning indirection did man increase his mastery over the beasts
BTS In the light baffling airs the schooner had been tacking about a great deal at which times the sails pass from one side to the other and a man is sent aloft to shift over the fore-gaff-topsail
BTS He shakes his head dubiously over the outlook for the man Johnson who is boat-puller in the same boat with him
BTS But it was the will of the god and he strove to submit
BTS He did not run long
BTS This continued but every time the hand lifted the hair lifted under it
BTS She approached more cautiously and the cub had full opportunity to observe her lean snakelike body and her head erect eager and snake-like itself
BTS Then it's jes' warm an' anxious I am to be hearin' you explain yourself he said
BTS It is an empty shell and soon even the empty shell will be taken away from you
BTS What'll I put on his feet sir
BTS His comrades were on their feet wild with anger capable of any violence
BTS SOCIETY was the creation of the idle rich who toiled not and who in this way played
BTS Brutality I had experienced but it was the brutality of the intellect the cutting sarcasm of Charley Furuseth the cruel epigrams and occasional harsh witticisms of the fellows at the Bibelot and the nasty remarks of some of the professors during my undergraduate days
BTS There was an impolite and sneering scepticism in his words and manner that secretly pleased most of them at the table though it seemed to bother Bishop Morehouse
BTS He knew the law too well to take it out of Grey Beaver
BTS And d'ye hear that
BTS That this dog and White Fang should come together was inevitable and for a week the anticipated fight was the mainspring of conversation in certain quarters of the town
BTS Not only is it inevitable that you small capitalists shall pass away but it is inevitable that the large capitalists and the trusts also shall pass away
BTS Out of this water I could see the two masts rising and that was all
BTS Matt reached for the rifle and at the same moment White Fang snarled
BTS She sprang savagely at the thing that had hurt her
BTS If he turned upon them Mit-sah would throw the stinging lash of the whip into his face
BTS Father was jubilant but Ernest was alarmed
BTS I had been making of her a creature goddess-like and unapproachable
BTS The fourth engineer and the three oilers after a warm interview with Wolf Larsen were furnished with outfits from the slop-chests assigned places under the hunters in the various boats and watches on the vessel and bundled forward into the forecastle
BTS never
BTS A hawk driving down out of the blue had barely missed him
BTS From the little I learned I knew that Ernest had been keeping his promise of taking him through hell
BTS for he never forgot the peck on the nose he had received from the first of that ilk he encountered
BTS You see I was a creature of environment and at that time had strong class instincts
BTS One arm was under his head the other lay on top of the blankets
BTS Sir he said to the Skookum Bench king no sir
BTS To the top of the foremast which was just lifted conveniently from the deck I attached the rigging stays and throat and peak halyards
BTS All of which is neither here nor there
BTS It was in the air and its presence was made visible by the armed soldiers drawn up in lines in the corridors and by the officers grouped in the entrances to the House itself
BTS Men were weak
BTS He may desire to escape pain or to enjoy pleasure
BTS Ernest and I well understood before we left the refuge how the strength of the Iron Heel was developing
BTS The newspapers published information of an unprecedented rise in wages and shortening of hours for the railroad employees the iron and steel workers and the engineers and machinists
BTS Now we have to do it all over again
BTS and upon his meagre frame was deposited an even more strikingly meagre head
BTS She was pretty and soft and had been chivalrously treated all her days
BTS And in vain he strove to gain the shelter of the cabin
BTS but my man died
BTS Again I could not disguise myself as a proletarian and travel
BTS In the yellow lantern light we peered at what we had accomplished
BTS In point of fact it is not a thought
BTS She shook her head
BTS But what struck me most forcibly was the total lack of sympathy on the part of the men whom I served
BTS He kept the fire brightly blazing for he knew that it alone intervened between the flesh of his body and their hungry fangs
BTS It was a hard trip with the mail behind them and the heavy work wore them down
BTS It will certainly fix it Mr
BTS The sailors slipped forward setting the side-lights as they went while the two hunters remained to sleep in the cabin it not being deemed advisable to open the slide to the steerage companion-way
BTS She made no acknowledgment
BTS White Fang waited an hour
BTS I guess the Iron Heel won't need our services Hartman remarked putting down the paper he had been reading when the train pulled into the central depot
BTS The mob came on but it could not advance
BTS That both of you are hair-splitting I said
BTS Leach's rage was no longer impotent
BTS at first
BTS Ever experienced it Mr
BTS At the forks he took the turning to the left where he found the lair of the lynx with whom his mother and he had fought long before
BTS Look close there
BTS Beauty Smith started
BTS It won't hurt him
BTS but he was staggering his left hand pressed against his forehead and covering his eyes and with the right he was groping about him in a dazed sort of way
BTS Both men were manifestly out of place and why such as they should adventure the North is part of the mystery of things that passes understanding
BTS or did they
BTS Bill demanded
BTS It was impossible
BTS It was to be expected
BTS It was the Macedonia
BTS Maud Brewster
BTS The stream moved slowly while from it arose groans and lamentations cursings babblings of senility hysteria and insanity
BTS We started with A B C Mr
BTS he demanded or bellowed rather
BTS Asmunsen refused to serve
BTS He was adjusting himself
BTS I am very ignorant she pleaded
BTS The shrewdest will-making lawyers were called in to make wills that could not be broken
BTS But still I had feared him blind and helpless and listening always listening and I never let his strong arms get within reach of me while I worked
BTS The rattle and bang of the frying-pan was grating horribly on my nerves
BTS I was resolved
BTS Oofty-Oofty who helped me drank
BTS Before Avis Everhard was born John Stuart Mill in his essay ON LIBERTY wrote Wherever there is an ascendant class a large portion of the morality emanates from its class interests and its class feelings of superiority
BTS The soul of him was good and yet it was twisted and maimed and blunted by the savagery of his life
BTS As well may you lift yourselves by your own bootstraps as to explain consciousness by consciousness
BTS She brushed her nose with her paws trying to dislodge the fiery darts thrust it into the snow and rubbed it against twigs and branches and all the time leaping about ahead sidewise up and down in a frenzy of pain and fright
BTS I shall be able to appreciate the lives of the working people hereafter
BTS So had the other man Johnson
BTS He was always keyed up alert for attack wary of being attacked with an eye for sudden and unexpected missiles prepared to act precipitately and coolly to leap in with a flash of teeth or to leap away with a menacing snarl
BTS Is it because you have no answer
BTS But my heart smote me when we climbed aboard and looked at the havoc he had done
BTS He struck out boldly but not straight enough into the stream
BTS The Philomath had no club house
BTS Feebly my own limbs were helping me
BTS When the fiat of the Plutocracy went forth they withdrew their advertisements from the Hearst papers
BTS But the clamour of approval did not distract him
BTS The practice and the name continued in the twentieth century
BTS There was a death-struggle during which White Fang walked around stiff-legged and observant
BTS I was in touch with great souls who exalted flesh and spirit over dollars and cents and to whom the thin wail of the starved slum child meant more than all the pomp and circumstance of commercial expansion and world empire
BTS Violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly
BTS Several times he fell down and was dragged in the traces and once the sled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs
BTS Each moment I looked and everybody looked for him to leap upon the boy and destroy him
BTS the third day forty miles which brought them well up toward the Five Fingers
BTS In that moment White Fang was in upon him and out in passing ripping his trimmed remnant of an ear
BTS Eight feet of the butt was above the rail and I was as far away as ever from getting the spar on board
BTS He had reasoned himself into a spell of the blues and within few hours one could look for the devil within him to be up and stirring
BTS No mention there of class hatred he smiled back
BTS He loved with single heart and refused to cheapen himself or his love
BTS Johnson was steering Leach bailing
BTS Life itself is unsatisfaction but to look ahead to death is greater unsatisfaction
BTS Two nights later came the act but on a more generous scale than the master had anticipated
BTS In past experience especially in dealing with squaws meat and punishment had often been disastrously related
BTS Their creed was Bust the Trusts
BTS The laborers were called to work and dismissed by savage screaming nerve-racking steam-whistles
BTS but they gave no heed
BTS He began at the first bunks forward on the star-board side
BTS With a shrug of the shoulders but with the warmest admiration and pride at heart for this woman I equipped her with the broken oar and took another for myself
BTS At the same time as an institution they will become temporarily all-powerful
BTS How'd it happen
BTS Oh one of them crackerjack minin' experts
BTS This exploit was particularly gratifying to the three men
BTS At another time Spitz went through dragging the whole team after him up to Buck who strained backward with all his strength his fore paws on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around
BTS Mr
BTS He was no longer afraid of minor things and much of his timidity had vanished though the unknown never ceased to press upon him with its mysteries and terrors intangible and ever-menacing
BTS nor did the man-animal resent it by giving him a blow on the head
BTS he called to me
BTS Another time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge and amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a long-barrelled flint-lock
BTS I'll shut yer mouth
BTS Ah he had thought so
BTS The open trap lay directly in his path and his discovery of it would lead instantly to his discovery of me
BTS Then milk was raised another cent only we didn't get any of that cent
BTS Leach he said you know I'm going to kill you some time or other don't you
BTS His face was convulsed and white his eyes were flashing his clenched fists raised overhead
BTS the organization with all its ramifications of our spy system
BTS Bill held up the empty cup
BTS They saw him with the eyes of their ancestors and by their inherited memory they knew White Fang for the wolf and they remembered the ancient feud
BTS I had not seen him for so long and the thought of a possible hitch or error in our plans that would keep him still in his island prison almost drove me mad
BTS I'm bitter enough over it as it is
BTS but the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability to flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his hide
BTS Also I was very thankful as I put the gun away and slipped back on deck
BTS He was a sled-dog before Beauty Smith got hold of him
BTS Better get your rifles you fellows Wolf Larsen called to our hunters
BTS Little discussion took place after this and the dinner soon broke up
BTS Yet I have seen the same man time and again fly into the most outrageous passion over a trifle
BTS I knew what to expect
BTS Wolf Larsen was quite considerate the sailors helped me and I was no longer in irritating contact with Thomas Mugridge
BTS The mate knows that and you know it sir
BTS The canoe shoved off
BTS I remember only one part of the service I said and that is And the body shall be cast into the sea
BTS He tried to outrun her by leaving the drive and circling across the lawn but she ran on the inner and smaller circle and was always there facing him with her two rows of gleaming teeth
BTS For Beauty Smith was cruel in the way that cowards are cruel
BTS The record of your stupidity is there in the books your own books that you never read
BTS Here are the figures
BTS Maud held the turn on the windlass and coiled down while I heaved
BTS With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased
BTS White-Fang even bristled up to him and walked stiff-legged but Lip-lip ignored the challenge
BTS also criminals
BTS Abandoned hastily was my conclusion as I ascended to the deck
BTS Night began to fall and to make matters worse the wind sprang up ahead
BTS His eyes were likewise greeted by White Fang but about the latter there were no signs of shame nor guilt
BTS that the sight and sense and touch of the loved one's hair was as much breath and voice and essence of the spirit as the light that shone from the eyes and the thoughts that fell from the lips
BTS He did not understand and I quickly learned that he did not know the poem
BTS Maud and I were astounded
BTS The firing ceased
BTS All the devil that was in him challenged the devil in Wolf Larsen
BTS We could not determine whether the balloon had been manned by comrades or enemies
BTS masters in the art were developing and a fund of tricks and expedients was being accumulated
BTS It is only an intuition and so far I have failed to find the slightest clew
BTS I felt myself turning sick in anticipation
BTS CHAPTER XXXV Next day the mast-steps clear and everything in readiness we started to get the two topmasts aboard
BTS Freedom to roam and run and lie down at will had been his heritage
BTS We lay scarcely rolling on the placid sea unable to follow
BTS Ain't run out
BTS All this I saw and my brain now working rapidly I thought a thousand thoughts
BTS It was all so ridiculous that when he got home he had to laugh himself
BTS I said brutally for I was not quite pleased with her thanking me
BTS It was the answer in terms not of speech but of love
BTS Black Burton a man evil-tempered and malicious had been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar when Thornton stepped good-naturedly between
BTS Very good
BTS I really saw nothing of the heroic work done by the comrades
BTS But in two days' time they dropped down the Yukon bank from the Barracks loaded with letters for the outside
BTS And furthermore he himself was free
BTS Yes she answered
BTS The first clean bite since I come aboard Harrison said to me at the galley door as he returned the dinner pots and pans from the forecastle
BTS but it breathed its last by the time we managed to get to leeward of the last lee boat
BTS I fixed him was Carlson's unimaginative way of describing the affair
BTS It was a mournful howl and as Buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it was lost in the distance
BTS But between him and Alice the master's wife there existed a secret
BTS He did not control the courts and the Sierra Mills did
BTS I noticed as we talked over his condition that Maud's sympathy went out to him more and more
BTS The hand with fingers crooked and spread apart rubbed his stomach in a playful way and rolled him from side to side
BTS Then as the moments went by it came to me that the situation was analogous to the one in which I had approached the long-maned bull my intention of clubbing obscured by fear until it became a desire to make him run
BTS The announcement was received with black silence though the other four hunters glanced significantly at the two who had been the cause of their banishment
BTS Reference is here made of course not to the oath of Smith but to the verb ripped used by Avis Everhard
BTS The four Indians laughed more loudly while even the man who had been bitten began to laugh
BTS And not only did he outrun them but circling widely back on his track he gathered in one of his exhausted pursuers
BTS Thus a large company could sell at a loss for a longer period than a small company and so drive the small company out of business
BTS Are you going to take up your duties as cabin-boy
BTS Tell him I lived to be sorry for the trouble I brought him and the things I done and and just tell him God bless him' for me
BTS We spoke no more though we had become too used to one another for the silence to be awkward
BTS His whole demeanour every action was stamped with this purpose
BTS He called them the holluschickie or something like that
BTS Van Weyden for the present at any rate earns his salty grub by assisting me
BTS They lived like beasts in great squalid labor-ghettos festering in misery and degradation
BTS In the English merchant service
BTS There was a final defiant clash of the long teeth
BTS their capacity to communicate motion to unmoving things
BTS Then and not until then would he flash from his hiding-place a grey projectile incredibly swift never failing its mark the fleeing squirrel that fled not fast enough
BTS Black duplicated the performance a moment later with the other foot
BTS You ain't got me yet
BTS Down
BTS The stick prevented him from getting at the leather that fastened the other end
BTS He came out with a piece of meat which he tossed to White Fang
BTS Will you kindly explain what has so long puzzled wiser heads than yours
BTS And you saw what a general strike would do Ernest went on
BTS This was the invidious distinction between them and the Sour-doughs who forsooth made their bread from sour-dough because they had no baking-powder
BTS I found myself strangely afraid of this woman I was escorting aft
BTS Won't come to the hand that's fed 'm all these months the dog-musher muttered resentfully
BTS Often in desperation he burst into long stretches of flight
BTS He must have known somehow that we were on board for he said Good-morning very confidently and waited for the greeting to be returned
BTS The thong grew taut
BTS It was as a cue to him seeming to rouse him to do what he would never have dreamed of doing
BTS His eyes were closed but few minutes when the burn of the flame on his flesh awakened him
BTS The whips snapped the bells tinkled merrily the sleds churned along the trail
BTS And each night when we come ashore in the boat Mr
BTS 'Tis the hand of God I'm tellin' you is the way Louis sees it
BTS He refused to stir
BTS Why did you lose the case
BTS Whereat he would laugh and his arms would leap out to me and he would call me his sweet metaphysician
BTS he asked
BTS Collie's teeth were no longer sharp
BTS Sure answered O'Brien thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of Matthewson's
BTS Gentlemen there stands the bear he pointed at Ernest and your buzzing has only tickled his ears
BTS PART IV CHAPTER I THE ENEMY OF HIS KIND Had there been in White Fang's nature any possibility no matter how remote of his ever coming to fraternise with his kind such possibility was irretrievably destroyed when he was made leader of the sled-team
BTS Mechanically at short range without letting go of it he thrust a brand full into her open and snarling mouth
BTS Van Weyden is sometimes how shall I say
BTS It was out of these secret agents of the employers that the Black Hundreds arose
BTS He shoved and shoved hard till the grating of the steel against the locked teeth could be distinctly heard
BTS It was very simple
BTS Weedon's back Weedon's mother announced
BTS My fingers were torn loose and I swept across to the side and over the side into the sea
BTS Possibly it was the fraction of a second but I had no knowledge of how long an interval had lapsed before I was myself again
BTS The look in her eyes became far away
BTS Oh 'ow I 'ate 'im
BTS As Mit-sah and Kloo-kooch had belonged to Grey Beaver sharing his food his fire and his blankets so now at Sierra Vista belonged to the love-master all the denizens of the house
BTS That night when I had finished an endless amount of work I was sent to sleep in the steerage where I made up a spare bunk
BTS By the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice Buck was played out
BTS Do you know what I was reminded of as I sat at table and listened to you talk and talk
BTS I am all here and more than here
BTS It was the Wild the savage frozen-hearted Northland Wild
BTS And the howling folly of it is that we are so helpless that such idiots really are managing our interests was Ernest's comment
BTS If it were not for this life would be dead
BTS His eyes were large and between them was the distance of two eyes
BTS So he was driven to hunt still smaller things
BTS Will you take the lady below and see to her comfort
BTS As I have said there is much light that I alone can throw upon his character
BTS The repeated drenchings in the icy water had likewise had their effect on him
BTS This hurt
BTS We dared not encourage such a spirit
BTS In some way when Harrison was aloft the sheet jammed in the block through which it runs at the end of the gaff
BTS Disguise did become a veritable art during that period
BTS But on the forecastle-head we found three sailors asleep
BTS It was the summer of 1898 and thousands of gold-hunters were going up the Yukon to Dawson and the Klondike
BTS And history tells of opportunities that came to the slaves who rose to the purple he answered grimly
BTS His trick was obvious
BTS Then there was a woman who charged from a heap snarling and shooting
BTS Of the meagreness of a child's life
BTS Thus he learned hurt
BTS With the introduction of machinery and the factory system in the latter part of the eighteenth century the great mass of the working people was separated from the land
BTS The motor-centres too I suggested
BTS But they can't hurt me father objected
BTS Besides White Fang was a valuable animal the strongest sled-dog he had ever owned and the best leader
BTS She had her heart set on a trip to the country hard enough as it was
BTS So there cannot be any complaint
BTS We will not enter into the squabbling over the division
BTS Of course he answered you took into consideration the audience to which it was addressed
BTS But it was before this that father returned one afternoon
BTS He economised
BTS He watched his moving muscles and was interested in the cunning mechanism of his fingers
BTS I am a sick man a very sick man he repeated again and yet once again
BTS I remembered the Cockney's way of putting it
BTS It knew only itself and the vastness and profundity of the quiet and the dark
BTS Outlined against the clear blue of the sky he had the appearance of an enormous spider crawling along the tracery of its web
BTS Ernest returned some books he had borrowed and went away first
BTS It was not until I became the old Avis Everhard and whispered secrets in his ear that none knew but he and Avis Everhard that he accepted me as his really truly wife
BTS Don't arouse this man's animosity
BTS Won't eat
BTS A dainty eater he found that his mates finishing first robbed him of his unfinished ration
BTS But the cub knew what it was and with a last long wail that had in it more of triumph than grief he ceased his noise and waited for the coming of his mother of his ferocious and indomitable mother who fought and killed all things and was never afraid
BTS Bishop Morehouse is right
BTS never attacked till he had first defended that attack
BTS The danger lay in the heavy fog which blanketed the bay and of which as a landsman I had little apprehension
BTS It made me angry and I glanced at Ernest
BTS The next thing to watch out for is bed sores
BTS Whose instructions
BTS And I suppose some one else makes your bed for you
BTS At twelve o'clock the southern horizon was warmed by the unseen sun
BTS My work is done well
BTS Then he began rolling down the slope over and over
BTS And now it's your chance
BTS The purse I found but its contents with the exception of the small silver had been abstracted
BTS There are no Republicans nor Democrats in this House
BTS He went up the frozen bed of the stream where the snow shaded by the trees was yet hard and crystalline
BTS But he did not come
BTS Show me evils such as you mention in our own community and I will protest
BTS Two nights and a day he spent in the cabin
BTS Louis has also given me additional information about Death Larsen which tallies with the captain's brief description
BTS We have no need for it
BTS It was written by an erring soul who yet saw clearly
BTS He has said there are a million and a half of revolutionists in the United States
BTS It struggled and tickled his tongue
BTS It did not take long to come to an understanding
BTS She shook her head
BTS I told him all that had taken place
BTS Dead he answered
BTS Fifty-two socialist Congressmen were tried and all were found guilty
BTS She half started back
BTS The life of only one member was demanded which was a remoter interest than their lives and in the end they were content to pay the toll
BTS They had but one alternative--to leave the soil and become vagrants in brief to starve
BTS Pickings he concluded
BTS An appreciable pause fell after I had closed the doors and drawn the slide a pause that must have lasted fully a minute
BTS said Matt in an awe-stricken voice
BTS Forever after Buck avoided his blind side and to the last of their comradeship had no more trouble
BTS The men toiled without speech across the face of the frozen world
BTS At the same time he was made aware of a sensation of hunger
BTS At last the time came that he decided to eat the meat from the hand
BTS He was often called the greatest lawyer in the country--corporation lawyer of course
BTS He avoided tight places and always backed out of it when they bade fair to surround him
BTS There is no Democratic Party
BTS Harrison ceased his progress and held on tightly
BTS When they arrived at Skaguay they were apparently on their last legs
BTS But this knowledge stopped with the working class
BTS he would proclaim triumphantly when he had brought one of them a cropper
BTS No not that she answered
BTS It cost Hearst eighteen million dollars a year to run his various papers and this sum and more he got back from the middle class in payment for advertising
BTS Many young men of the Oligarchy impelled by sense of right conduct or their imaginations captured by the glory of the Revolution ethically or romantically devoted their lives to it
BTS The very thing I was coming to he said
BTS and also this sleek capitalist owned the machine the machine boss and the railroads that issued the passes
BTS I remembered the life-preservers stored in the cabin but was met at the door and swept backward by a wild rush of men and women
BTS But while he eyed the approaching hand he at the same time contrived to keep track of the club in the other hand suspended threateningly above him
BTS In San Francisco we did not know what was happening even across the bay in Oakland or Berkeley
BTS I bowed to and disclaimed the compliment
BTS but you can depend upon it that blessed brother of mine has twigged our little game and is just a-humping for us
BTS He flung himself upon another and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own throat
BTS That means  she began
BTS I didn't stop to see if the belt was off
BTS But ever her eyes looked bravely at me and ever her lips uttered brave words
BTS I suggested
BTS Their open mutiny however was without doubt precipitated by the agents-provocateurs
BTS There was no warning of the existence of the hole nor was it a hole in the common sense of the word
BTS When he strong man that he was loving life as he did accepted his death it was plain that he was troubled by something more than mere blindness
BTS We're all solid with the corporations he answered
BTS Everywhere institutions and governments were crashing
BTS They flashed wide open big and black and stared unblinking into our faces
BTS He compromised
BTS Perhaps some new devilry of the gods was about to be perpetrated on him
BTS Look here Mr
BTS He felt strangely numb
BTS He wore a ready-made suit of dark cloth that was ill adjusted to his body
BTS called the strange man in the carriage
BTS Then I compelled her to stand up and though she would have fallen had I not supported her I forced her to walk back and forth the several steps between the thwart and the stern-sheets and finally to spring up and down
BTS If it did it would not have any deposits in the savings banks
BTS It was the final word
BTS I leaned toward her
BTS But he was still only a part-grown puppy and stronger than the call either of man or of the Wild was the call of his mother
BTS The inner doors to the entrance were locked and bolted
BTS In the end it will take it all away from you
BTS The automobiles on which they were mounted blocked the street compelling the soldiers to find positions in between and on the sidewalks
BTS That also have we considered Ernest replied
BTS And he for all his grey years and sage experience behaved quite as puppyishly and even a little more foolishly
BTS And you
BTS A savage expression flitted across it
BTS The mate's gone so I can't afford to lose you too
BTS The set of his mouth his chin his jaw was likewise firm or harsh with all the fierceness and indomitableness of the male the nose also
BTS He'd kill them on sight
BTS Mugridge seemed to be in rabid fear of the water and he exhibited a nimbleness and speed we did not dream he possessed
BTS The tent illumined by a candle glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain
BTS I wouldn't whisper my suspicions to a soul but somehow I don't think I'll leave Chicago alive
BTS Tim Keenan joined one of the groups
BTS But greater than that to the wolf-cub was their mastery over things not alive
BTS He was a humanist and a lover
BTS Opposed to you are two great forces each of which is more powerful than you of the middle class
BTS So peremptorily did these shades beckon him that each day mankind and the claims of mankind slipped farther from him
BTS He couldn't fool me
BTS Then I resolved to wait and at the last moment when we entered on the final stretch to take her in my arms and proclaim my love and with her in my embrace to make the desperate struggle and die
BTS I was surprised considering the fierce struggle in the forecastle at the superficiality of his hurts and I pride myself that I dressed them dexterously
BTS Understand
BTS Such fearful treatment of the great Colonel Van Gilbert was unheard of undreamed of impossible to believe--the great Colonel Van Gilbert before whom judges trembled when he arose in court
BTS The dairymen were wiped out of existence
BTS As it was I scrambled to my feet and cried out the danger call
BTS It was like learning a new language say the French
BTS They remained in a circle about him and his fire displaying an arrogance of possession that shook his courage born of the morning light
BTS And I can tell you that my life is pretty valuable just now to myself
BTS She will be your representative in the battle-front
BTS and from them he came to know that the things not alive were not all in the same state of stable equilibrium as was his cave also that small things not alive were more liable than large things to fall down or turn over
BTS I do not care to remember
BTS Or as chance might have it he would lie farther away to the side or rear watching the outlines of the man and the occasional movements of his body
BTS But the rest of the hands had a lively fear of consequences to come and gave no heed to him
BTS Just before dinner starting for the beach with an empty barrel they altered their course and bore away to the left to round the promontory which jutted into the sea between them and liberty
BTS One fist unclosed and the open palm swept across his eyes as though brushing away cobwebs
BTS Van Weyden keep this course for the present and you might as well set the watches for we won't do any lingering to-night
BTS Then he talked harshly to the unwitting culprit and in his voice there was nothing but godlike wrath
BTS Then it was counter-massacre
BTS I have never seen him otherwise
BTS Then speech poured from him
BTS But after that he was afraid no more of the looming bulks of the tepees
BTS But he resolutely held the door of his tepee inside which he had placed the culprit and refused to permit the vengeance for which his tribespeople clamoured
BTS And this was the epitaph of a dead dog on the Northland trail less scant than the epitaph of many another dog of many a man
BTS There was a wild keen look in them I had never seen before and her lips parted and her breath suspended as the Ghost charging upon the wall of rock at the entrance to the inner cove swept into the wind and filled away into safe water
BTS But the quick eye of Wolf Larsen caught him
BTS O'Connor laughed and shook his head
BTS It marked midnight
BTS I can close my eyes now and hear it drip drop drip drop all about me
BTS Do you remember how in six months the Tobacco Trust squeezed out over four hundred cigar stores in New York City alone
BTS Now I shall see and learn for myself
BTS Age
BTS I threw up my hands with helpless disapproval of his inveterate materialism and went about making the bed
BTS But this was not to the fancy of the Iron Heel
BTS I have dreamed as greatly as the Corsican
BTS His lids lifted lazily as he asked the question and it seemed that the deeps were opening to me and that I was gazing into his soul
BTS The seals were thick the wind was dying away
BTS The hands do not early get over the stiffness
BTS Dog-mushers' cries were heard
BTS and high ideals
BTS But my knee was bothering me terribly
BTS The children welcomed White Fang with glad cries and ran to meet him
BTS They might be town-reared dogs but the instinctive fear of the Wild was theirs just the same
BTS Too many heads had been broken in the early strikes
BTS But here amongst ourselves let us speak out
BTS Don't know
BTS Be careful
BTS If this man-animal intended harm White Fang knew that he could not escape it
BTS he called softly
BTS It is cheaper so much cheaper to buy a general than to fight him and his whole army
BTS LEG-BAR--the African slaves were so manacled
BTS Why it would be rank ridiculousness for me to take that dog along he broke out after another pause
BTS It had managed to roll up in a ball again but it was not quite the old compact ball
BTS Any of them contained possible death
BTS I had always been a book-worm
BTS You will find them all slaves of the machine
BTS Lashing the wheel I ran forward eased the fore and mainsheets took in on the boom-tackles and trimmed everything for the quartering breeze which was ours
BTS He was a weak and inefficient-looking man the lawyer and at sight of him I did not wonder that Jackson's case had been lost
BTS Ballingford being that the latter has made the God of the oligarchs a little more gaseous and a little less vertebrate
BTS What terrified me was the Bishop's helplessness
BTS This canard was circulated by the creatures of the Oligarchy
BTS It was the machine that killed her
BTS Thornton shook his head
BTS I looked at Maud Brewster and knew that she was similarly affected
BTS Thus he was trying to shield himself from White Fang's teeth
BTS White Fang never raided a chicken-roost again
BTS Perrault and Francois having cleaned out their part of the camp hurried to save their sled-dogs
BTS Once Maud screamed in terror as a cow thrust an inquisitive nose toward her foot and several times I quickened my pace for the same reason
BTS All Sierra Vista was gathered around
BTS He drew up his legs and the man-eater seemed no more than barely to touch one foot sinking back into the water with a splash
BTS But Matt's foot had already started on its way to kick White Fang
BTS And there were the dogs ever squabbling and bickering bursting into uproars and creating confusions
BTS It is so short-sighted on the part of the workingmen
BTS It means that the resources of Brazil are being developed
BTS To their ears came the sounds of dogs wrangling and scuffling the guttural cries of men the sharper voices of scolding women and once the shrill and plaintive cry of a child
BTS The same with a returning explorer from the polar regions or the latest literary or artistic success
BTS I suppose you know a bit about literary things
BTS Look at that hunter iv mine Horner
BTS while his brain thrust all awry by the unwonted stimulant permitted him to go any length to obtain it
BTS That's why we live so long
BTS You have not yet picked out the flaw in my definition of philosophy
BTS Well don't be a miser with what you know Scott said sharply after waiting a suitable length of time
BTS Ten years ago
BTS And it won't be comfortable in the boat rowing and sailing in this rainy weather
BTS At first he was dignified and the master laughed the harder
BTS The feel of him was bad
BTS It was a heritage he had received directly from One Eye and the she-wolf
BTS It was the curiosity of growth that urged him on the necessity of learning and living and doing that brings experience
BTS Calvin asserted positively
BTS And he did it deliberately
BTS Oaths and vile language of any sort had always been repellent to me
BTS At last one morning the propeller was quiet and the Narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement
BTS I can do what other men have done and I know that other men have clubbed seals
BTS But don't you care to escape as well as we
BTS There was nothing for the dogs to do save the hauling in of meat now and again that Thornton killed and Buck spent long hours musing by the fire
BTS He put his hand upon her head and she only crouched closer
BTS And the chief thing demanded by these intricacies of civilisation was control restraint a poise of self that was as delicate as the fluttering of gossamer wings and at the same time as rigid as steel
BTS Wolf Larsen was on the poop smoking his everlasting cigar
BTS He had a wife and three children
BTS But it was all of no avail
BTS and thereat he was on his feet and raging his disappointment with tears in his eyes
BTS He knows the meaning of firearms as well as you do
BTS How did it happen
BTS He was gone eight hours and he came back through the darkness hungrier than when he had started
BTS Who earned it
BTS Life had become a hell to him
BTS Yet submission made him master his fear and he only growled softly
BTS Gentlemen I have merely sketched the power of one of the seven groups that constitute the brain of the Plutocracy
BTS The trouble was precipitated by the Iron Heel
BTS The basic life that was in him took charge of him
BTS But my next sharp recollection begins with the crack of a rifle and an abrupt becoming aware that I am being fired at by a soldier in an automobile
BTS She broke the hearts of scores of our young comrades and scores of others she captured and by their heart-strings led into our organization
BTS Serve out plenty of whisky to the hunters and see that a few bottles slip for'ard
BTS Also in his gambling he had one besetting weakness faith in a system
BTS Those snaps were always delivered on the empty air
BTS He was fighting grimly and silently for life
BTS But Hartman only cursed the Iron Heel and we passed on
BTS Of a larger appetite and more luck in satisfying it
BTS Again he wandered about through the great camp looking for them and again he returned
BTS The men you talked with--who were they
BTS This was the first great slave-drive
BTS When it comes to powder chemical mixtures are better than mechanical mixtures you take my word
BTS The second hut was easier to erect for I built it against the first and only three walls were required
BTS But then you see that's all part of the day's work he wound up boyishly
BTS Thus he waited keeping perfectly quiet
BTS and one and all he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater
BTS It was gone
BTS If Jesus was right then these two unfortunates were my sisters and the only hope of their purification was in my affection and tenderness
BTS but even that constitution could not keep the tired look out of his eyes
BTS Ernest went on to his rise in society till at last he came in touch with members of the upper classes and rubbed shoulders with the men who sat in the high places
BTS Pooh
BTS And I make free to say as the days went by that I found I was taking a certain secret pride in myself
BTS No man less than a giant could have done what he did once he had gained the foot of the ladder
BTS He was simple direct afraid of nothing and he refused to waste time on conventional mannerisms
BTS Besides he did not like the hands of the man-animals
BTS But White Fang sat on his haunches and ki-yi'd and ki-yi'd a forlorn and pitiable little figure in the midst of the man-animals
BTS But those terrible hands of his
BTS I was wrong
BTS Why then in the United States to-day are there three million child laborers
BTS A feud ages old was between them and she for one would see to it that he was reminded
BTS What chance had he to be anything else than he was
BTS Like ghosts the agents came and went obeying commands fulfilling duties following clews making their reports often to officers they never saw or cooperating with other agents they had never seen before and would never see again
BTS He was thinner and there were lines on his face which I had never seen before
BTS I noticed that my father was annoyed because Ernest did not talk
BTS He must master or be mastered
BTS It had flung its hated rival out of the world-market and enabled us to dispose of our surplus in that market
BTS Smallpox in 'Onolulu two broken legs in Shanghai pnuemonia in Unalaska three busted ribs an' my insides all twisted in 'Frisco
BTS I tich heem queek as anyt'ing
BTS I don't know anything more
BTS Each building was a possible ambuscade
BTS It gives a thrill to life he explained to me when life is carried in one's hand
BTS There's only six now he said
BTS There was quite a group about the wreck and two men were just lifting up the wounded officer to carry him to the other machine
BTS But it was not food that Buck and the huskies needed but rest
BTS I was trembling all over and I could feel the shivers running up and down my spine and the sweat standing out on my forehead
BTS The best sailorman in the fo'c'sle
BTS I hadn't a fair chance he began whining again
BTS It may cripple you some but all the same you'll be learning to walk
BTS In the meantime the rest of the working class was more harshly treated
BTS I was too happy and the fatigue of jail-breaking and riding horseback had not been mine
BTS no eighty-three
BTS Later how much later I have no knowledge I came to myself with a start of fear
BTS He smelled it and found it so recent that he crouched swiftly and looked in the direction in which it disappeared
BTS There was not a single instance of miscarriage
BTS he cried and I heard through the tumult as one might hear a whisper
BTS But think Humphrey a fellow-creature in his last lonely hour
BTS If I had only known
BTS No two ropes were of the same length while the difference in length between any two ropes was at least that of a dog's body
BTS In the winter the cariboo forsook their accustomed track
BTS Then the rope was removed and he was flung into a cagelike crate
BTS As the front of it passed under the warring buildings both went into action again--one building dropping bombs into the street being attacked from across the street and in return replying to that attack
BTS The sparkle and bubble has gone out and it is a tasteless drink
BTS But Mugridge had little stomach for a dip in it
BTS But I know men club them I persisted
BTS No anger nor bitterness possessed him
BTS Further she was unafraid of things
BTS Finally the additional quarter of a cent was denied us
BTS I was not wrong when I decided that his days had been spent on the sea
BTS Kelly cried stepping between me and the ladder his right hand shaped into a veritable strangler's clutch
BTS Believe me Joshua's task was easier and he had Jehovah to help him
BTS But it is the way of the metaphysicians and I forgive you
BTS He was a small man to begin with
BTS and it was the most natural thing in the world that he should obey it by turning his back on his new-born family and by trotting out and away on the meat-trail whereby he lived
BTS The cub who had thus received a name in the world lay and watched
BTS And that something I shall call the Oligarchy
BTS A club might have stopped White Fang but not a whip
BTS He did not know that it was a wolverine standing outside all a-trembling with its own daring and cautiously scenting out the contents of the cave
BTS in 1908 1108427
BTS How long this lasted I have no conception for a blankness intervened of which I remember no more than one remembers of troubled and painful sleep
BTS He delighted in it
BTS It seems to me impossible sometimes that they ever had mothers
BTS I tell you yes an' broke to harness
BTS We are so close to land
BTS Least of all would I have expected again to meet this man Joseph Hurd
BTS I'm a paralytic now
BTS In the swamps and deserts and waste places from Florida to Alaska the small groups of Indians that survived were dancing ghost dances and waiting the coming of a Messiah of their own
BTS At such times reason fled from White Fang and in his transports of rage he was even more mad than Beauty Smith
BTS Woe to the Iron Heel
BTS So when we left him he lay handcuffed hand and foot
BTS They do get on the nerves horrible  Henry sympathised
BTS And all his life he sang the song of man
BTS the dog-musher began softly then changed his mind and betrayed a rising anger of his own
BTS and all three rode on railroad passes
BTS My brother told me about it when I was a little girl
BTS The latter bayoneted the struggling wretches though one I saw who gained his feet and flew at a soldier's throat with his teeth
BTS The Aurora was the first steamboat of the year for the Outside and her decks were jammed with prosperous adventurers and broken gold seekers all equally as mad to get to the Outside as they had been originally to get to the Inside
BTS And I shall not go so far but what I can get back before night
BTS It was my task to tally the pelts as they came aboard from the boats to oversee the skinning and afterward the cleansing of the decks and bringing things ship-shape again
BTS Stow that
BTS Remember he warned my definition is fatal to metaphysics
BTS Now and then I looked through the carriage windows and suddenly my eyes seemed to be opened and I saw things as they really are
BTS The master thought of writing a note but searched his pockets vainly for pencil and paper
BTS But he was consumed with indignation real or feigned
BTS I envy you I envy you
BTS Wot I say
BTS Who got the advance money
BTS He abruptly turned on his heel and started forward
BTS His grey eyes seemed metallic and steel-like as they flashed upon the crowd
BTS That's my purpose
BTS There is much light that I alone of all persons living can throw upon his character and so noble a character cannot be blazoned forth too brightly
BTS Both men bent over the dogs
BTS But he still lived a public life in a cage surrounded by curious men
BTS Oh yes I remember it now
BTS Once he looked straight across at me and in his face was all the dumb pathos of the wounded and hunted animal
BTS Everything was ready for the attempt
BTS My blood chills when I think of it
BTS and nothing happened
BTS I got out a heavy shirt new from the slop-chest and made from blanket goods
BTS It was now so dark that there was no sign of the boat
BTS and he gravely permitted them to clamber and tumble over him
BTS The big wolves ate the little wolves and in the social pack Jackson was one of the least of the little wolves
BTS the Iron Heel will walk upon our faces
BTS He was cat-footed and lithe and strong always strong
BTS She made a wry pucker with her mouth as though to advertise her ignorance of dressmaking
BTS and it belonged to Buck as he clung to the flank of the herd retarding its march irritating the young bulls worrying the cows with their half-grown calves and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage
BTS He was perpetually departing on yard-long adventures toward the cave's entrance and as perpetually being driven back
BTS Soon they have surpluses and are seeking other countries on which to unload
BTS Then you must work later--till after midnight sometimes
BTS I made no reply
BTS He did not dare it under the circumstances for he had only Louis and me to depend upon and Louis was even now at the wheel
BTS Their testimony as he put it wasn't what it ought to have ben
BTS It is not at all remarkable that this same note should have been struck by the Church a generation or so later in relation to the defence of capitalistic property
BTS But Baseek did not wait
BTS But I blocked his path and did not offer to move
BTS I was wondering
BTS Then came the day when through the open cabin door White Fang saw the fatal grip on the floor and the love-master packing things into it
BTS As for you he went on turning toward Colonel Van Gilbert you have replied to nothing I have said
BTS Bill began to eat sleepily
BTS Had he not been hungry himself White Fang might have gone with him and eventually found his way into the pack amongst his wild brethren
BTS It was a full-grown mosquito one that had lain frozen in a dry log all winter and that had now been thawed out by the sun
BTS His free hand went to my throat and in that moment I knew the bitterest foretaste of death earned by one's own idiocy
BTS He could not be angry
BTS When he saw or heard her coming he got up and walked off
BTS Now they were really shocked and they sat wordless until Mr
BTS You would have time retrace its steps from noon to morning
BTS What vessel is this and where is she bound
BTS The storm had evidently broken during the night though a huge sea was still running and a stiff wind blowing
BTS Then he discovered him standing where he had been lying near to the stove
BTS Jock Horner quiet as was his way gave no sign
BTS The book created a furor and was promptly suppressed by the Oligarchy
BTS Leach never changed his position on the edge of the bunk
BTS It seemed to radiate a promise of peace and protection
BTS he made a thousand per cent
BTS Men fight and struggle ferociously for one another's lives
BTS It is too long a story to enter into now
BTS It was evident that they did not like the outlook of a voyage under such a captain and begun so inauspiciously
BTS So he remained in his bondage waiting for her
BTS He knew the law of forage
BTS And the life-preserver in which I floated
BTS I did not attempt to shout but communicated the news to Wolf Larsen by waving my arm
BTS But it is expedient doctrine
BTS Are you hungry
BTS At last he spoke
BTS In the midst of the wreckage of overthrown and smashed furniture partly on his side his face hidden by an arm lay a man
BTS stuttered a member of the latest dynasty a king of the Skookum Benches
BTS My experiences were confined to them
BTS I felt proud of myself as we sat down to the table
BTS for 'twas the other fellow Smoke sent up in the buckets to the top of the mine
BTS There was no thick mat of fur to baffle White Fang's teeth as they were often baffled by dogs of his own breed
BTS Her eyes were too heavy to suggest more than a hint of the sleepy surprise that perplexed her as she looked up at me and she half stumbled half tottered as I led her to her cabin
BTS We drew him back to his narrative
BTS Carn't yer see you've bloomin' well rubbed all the gent's skin orf
BTS Wickson who owned the whole eastern and northern slopes of Sonoma Mountain running from the Spreckels estate to the divide of Bennett Valley
BTS White Fang tried to face it
BTS Some days they did not make ten miles
BTS A shrill little whistle piping as if gone mad came from directly ahead and from very near at hand
BTS I have it deposited in many different banks under different names
BTS He laughed next day when he read the newspapers and then he grew angry to a degree that eliminated all tonic qualities
BTS The abjectness of their servitude is incomprehensible to us
BTS He did not seem to resent the delicate slurs
BTS Besides it did not seem to him that it was intended he should fight with the dog he saw before him
BTS I should not call it anything more than mathematical certainty
BTS A revolver-shot rang out
BTS It is terrible
BTS A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed his muscles swelled out and the flesh came back to cover his bones
BTS Do you know what a machine-breaker is
BTS The master was running up but was too far away
BTS And he could do nothing
BTS ' You are aware of your impotency
BTS And oh the marvel of it
BTS These men placed no value whatever upon their own lives and it was they who totally destroyed the great Mercenary city of Bellona along with its population of over a hundred thousand souls
BTS and the other two were Mason and Vanderbold the brains of the inner circle of the Oligarchy's secret service
BTS In the very heart of the herd the din was terrific
BTS A strip of scarlet cloth a bearskin twenty cartridges and Kiche went to pay the debt
BTS But Beauty Smith had not created himself and no blame was to be attached to him
BTS The man who gave me the order was one of the oligarchs I could tell that by his speech though I did not know his name nor see his face
BTS Here goes I said backing water with one oar and running the bow ashore
BTS I finally crawled to my feet and ascended the companion stairs
BTS No
BTS Then he leaped back to his seat and the machine dashed on took the turn at the corner and was gone from sight
BTS To be obedient to them was to escape hurt and make for happiness
BTS It was an exclamation of surprise
BTS and it was Collie that saved the hound's life
BTS How does it come that you are alone
BTS For your living
BTS And you absorbed the profits they had been making
BTS There had never been any labor troubles there
BTS But the gods had given him a different environment and he was moulded into a dog that was rather wolfish but that was a dog and not a wolf
BTS The usual fire was necessary to save them
BTS I dared not cross the continent in my own character
BTS He was a thing of the wild come in from the wild to sit by John Thornton's fire rather than a dog of the soft Southland stamped with the marks of generations of civilization
BTS But Francois chuckling at the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice brought his lash down upon Buck with all his might
BTS And then there was the windlass
BTS And when shall we arrive at Yokohama
BTS but there were no sleds in the Southland nor did dogs pack burdens on their backs
BTS He regained his balance by the steerage companion-way and stood there dizzily for a space when he suddenly crumpled up and collapsed his legs bending under him as he sank to the deck
BTS The flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists
BTS It's the same way that you are going
BTS It is crystallizing now
BTS There is no other name for it
BTS And Buck was truly a red-eyed devil as he drew himself together for the spring hair bristling mouth foaming a mad glitter in his blood-shot eyes
BTS But this he was to learn early in his residence in Santa Clara Valley
BTS There was much in other matters for White Fang to learn
BTS White Fang trembled with fear and though the impulse came to crawl out of his hiding-place he resisted it
BTS My feet were stinging from the bite of the frost and I hoped fervently that the sun would shine
BTS and it received easement only by the touch of the new god's presence
BTS Because of a thousand capitalistic devices labor cannot buy back even half of the total product
BTS All your experience of men and things is worthless here
BTS by W
BTS he queried
BTS The dogs sprang against the breast-bands strained hard for a few moments then relaxed
BTS Be sure and lock the front door
BTS One hundred and eighty-five dollars even he said aloud
BTS Her appreciation of the ridiculous was keen and in all things she unerringly saw and felt where it existed the touch of sham the overshading the overtone
BTS I did it
BTS Though the rest of her sails were gone the jib backed to windward and the mainsail hauled down flat were themselves holding and holding her bow to the furious sea as well
BTS Beauty Smith strode into camp and stood over White Fang
BTS What is the end
BTS And the men went early to bed Bill first seeing to it that the dogs were tied out of gnawing-reach of one another
BTS So terrible was his appearance that Spitz was forced to forego disciplining him
BTS The result will be great art
BTS I noted the gurgling forefoot was very like a snore and as I listened to it the effect of Wolf Larsen's swift rush from sublime exultation to despair slowly left me
BTS Simultaneously with the destruction of the Grangers came the revolt of the coal miners
BTS They had a sanction in their own class-ethic for every act they performed
BTS We are in the dark
BTS There is no trusting one
BTS And of all unwarranted things
BTS he always dressed for dinner or supper rather
BTS Henry cried in wrath leaving the cooking to come and count the dogs
BTS Let me think
BTS Taking the rope and leading the way I passed through a glade of tangled vines and bushes that ran between two wooded knolls
BTS Five men he said can produce bread for a thousand
BTS he demanded impatiently
BTS On point after point Ernest challenged the ministers
BTS And yet Maud declared that she had never felt better or stronger in her life
BTS And in the meantime they made preparation for the general strike
BTS Van Weyden there accustomed to having things done for you
BTS Kelly ripped up a bottom board and began paddling but dropped it with a cry of pain as its splinters drove into his hands
BTS His heredity was a life-stuff that may be likened to clay
BTS On the next day Koona went and but five of them remained Joe too far gone to be malignant
BTS but the difference in their height was too great
BTS His eyes ceased to see visions
BTS At last was being realized Karl Marx's classic The knell of private capitalist property sounds
BTS Then and quite suddenly he became aware of loneliness
BTS That's clear isn't it
BTS Gongs sounded on the Martinez
BTS while he fought with his fangs alone and she fought with her sharp-clawed feet as well
BTS You are not frightened
BTS In the 'tween-decks of the Narwhal Buck and Curly joined two other dogs
BTS At least that's our name for it I amended
BTS Matt helped the man to his feet
BTS And all the wonder in the completion Maud added
BTS With drooping tail and shivering body very forlorn indeed he aimlessly circled the tent
BTS Ernest told me that the fraction of an instant before it exploded he both heard and saw it strike at his feet
BTS As I searched the vacant stretch of water before me I comprehended thoroughly the need for haste if we were to recover any of our men
BTS All of which served to make White Fang's days enjoyable
BTS Here is one hundred dollars' worth of leather
BTS I could feel other hands at my throat
BTS She had a way of looking one in the eyes and demanding the truth and thus she looked at me as she asked the question
BTS I reckon it's up to me to kill 'm as I said I'd do
BTS What can we do
BTS John Thornton stood over Buck struggling to control himself too convulsed with rage to speak
BTS That he's going home some day to see his mother I answered diplomatically
BTS and taking her hand I led her on deck
BTS The darned cuss
BTS The sealing boats are not made for windward work
BTS Teek who had not travelled so far that winter and who was now beaten more than the others because he was fresher
BTS The general tone of the team picked up immediately
BTS On every side wherever the live coals had fallen the snow was sizzling and every little while a retiring wolf with wild leap and snort and snarl announced that one such live coal had been stepped upon
BTS As night drew on the clouds darkened and the wind freshened so that when Maud and I ate supper it was with our mittens on and with me still steering and eating morsels between puffs
BTS For a day and a night he remained by the kill eating and sleeping turn and turn about
BTS He leaped in with a flash of fangs that ripped down the side of the mastiff's neck
BTS I shall never forget this conversation
BTS It impressed one with its sullen determination to blow and blow harder and keep on blowing
BTS It was another instance of the plasticity of his clay of his capacity for being moulded by the pressure of environment
BTS I tried to withdraw it but his fingers tightened without visible effort till I thought mine would be crushed
BTS Danger and hurt and death did not lurk everywhere about him
BTS Once they've got the habit and the taste of blood
BTS Here came to dinner all sorts and conditions of men--scientists politicians bankers merchants professors labor leaders socialists and anarchists
BTS Matthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow
BTS and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst even Spitz left him alone
BTS It was at this time that the quarterly dividend of the Sierra Mills was paid--or rather should have been paid for father did not receive his
BTS It was a slow clumsy and costly way of weaving cloth this cottage system of manufacture
BTS Matt it was who tried to put him into the harness and make him haul sled with the other dogs
BTS They have already walked upon my face father explained
BTS Van Weyden
BTS He linked the past with the present and the eternity behind him throbbed through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and seasons swayed
BTS the instincts which were but the memories of his ancestors become habits which had lapsed in later days and still later in him quickened and become alive again
BTS I heard Wolf Larsen mutter half to himself half to them as though they could hear
BTS Next I became aware of stinging cheeks and nose and could feel blood dripping on my face
BTS but ever afterward death has been a simple fact that does not matter it is so easy
BTS In fact there was nothing equivocal about him
BTS When Brazil under the capitalist system has developed her resources she will herself have an unconsumed surplus
BTS Lie down sir
BTS Here you One Ear
BTS In vain we searched for him after our organization had developed
BTS They reminded him of children gathered about a spread table and awaiting permission to begin to eat
BTS The frightened household clustered at the top of the stairway
BTS But have you thought of ordering the window-glass
BTS Women and children were carrying more sticks and branches to Grey Beaver
BTS We were lying head to north-west and it was his intention to jibe over all with the first puff
BTS It was not the dead-tiredness that comes through brief and excessive effort from which recovery is a matter of hours
BTS He was hanging by them head downward
BTS Poor simple folk Ernest said to me in an undertone
BTS The beaches of the outer cove were thundering with the surf and even in our land-locked inner cove a respectable sea was breaking
BTS It was dawn by three in the morning and twilight lingered till nine at night
BTS Where is the seat of your trouble
BTS Ernest was in the thick of the fight when the end came
BTS Also and quite as a matter of course as though in his life he had already made a thousand toilets he proceeded to lick away the dry clay that soiled him
BTS He did not know what to make of it
BTS While all his ship was getting drunk as fast as it could he remained sober
BTS He is soul-sick from the journey through hell I have given him
BTS The automobiles were blown to fragments along with many soldiers
BTS Beauty Smith cowered down in anticipation of the blow
BTS It must not be mistaken for an attack upon the Catholic Church
BTS Also he was blind blind as a bat
BTS She bore a charmed life and prospered amid dangers and alarms
BTS Only a few seconds elapsed before he was on his feet again
BTS The Charleston Baptist Association issued the following in an address in 1835 A
BTS It was tense and hoarse with an overmastering rage
BTS And about the meat there seemed nothing wrong
BTS Hurd the great charity organizer
BTS The fire was burning low
BTS I queried
BTS Hartman sprang in front of me
BTS Now watch me take Kelly's right oar Smoke said drawing a more careful aim
BTS He is helpless and frightened I imagine for the first time in his life
BTS I had luncheon with Wilcox
BTS The more his opponents grew excited the more Ernest deliberately excited them
BTS broke off the side of one of these knolls and toppled it into the hole where the Everhards made their refuge
BTS The ptarmigan dragged him out of the bush
BTS The lynx was dead
BTS I was aware of a pent stifled feeling
BTS Just as I thought
BTS Leach his bandaged arm prominently to the fore begged me to leave a few remnants of the cook for him
BTS I don't believe it
BTS He openly threatened the other's leadership
BTS They had much to learn and in the meantime our Fighting Groups weeded them out
BTS but keep your lamps out for thruppenny-bits or the publicans 'll shove 'em on you for sixpence
BTS The hand continued slowly to descend while he crouched beneath it eyeing it malignantly his snarl growing shorter and shorter as with quickening breath it approached its culmination
BTS Wolf Larsen walking up and down with Smoke and in conversation took no more notice of him though he cried sharply once to the man at the wheel You're off your course my man
BTS The very thing Mr
BTS The sea-water was streaming from him
BTS Talk about your rough-houses Matt murmured gleefully standing in the doorway and looking on
BTS They made their bread with baking-powder
BTS He merely classified the things that hurt and the things that did not hurt
BTS then I stole into the cabin for my marmalade and underclothes slipped back past the galley and climbed down to the beach to deliver my barefoot report
BTS Do be cautious she called after me
BTS By the way how much was it that Cooky got away with
BTS The Wolf is not yet dead I muttered to myself as I sprang down through the smoke
BTS You will become proletarians
BTS He was elated
BTS His temper had been savage by birth but it became more savage under this unending persecution
BTS It was all that was left of Spanker the stick with which he had been tied
BTS Life had a thousand faces and White Fang found he must meet them all thus when he went to town in to San Jose running behind the carriage or loafing about the streets when the carriage stopped
BTS Thornton's desperate struggle was fresh-written on the earth and Buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep pool
BTS And just seven days afterward was approved by the President of the United States
BTS When they put a clothes-sack on the front of the sled she suggested it should go on the back
BTS Hammerfield suddenly demanded What is the test of truth young man
BTS Nothing serious Mr
BTS And then she cried Oh Humphrey I am afraid of him
BTS The sudden transition was startling
BTS Later he observed that the boy and girl were of great value in the master's eyes
BTS Then came a momentary fear when he yelped several times to the impact of the hand
BTS I stopped for I did not know what was coming and saw the galley door slide shut with a bang
BTS His throat worked spasmodically but made no sound while he struggled with all his body convulsed with the effort to rid himself of the incommunicable something that strained for utterance
BTS Then there was a ragged telegram describing an outbreak of the populace in New York City in which the labor castes were joining concluding with the statement intended to be accepted as a bluff that the troops had the situation in hand
BTS Tim Keenan continued standing over him but Scott took no further notice of his presence
BTS And then without warning a mob arose one night and under a waving American flag singing patriotic songs set fire to the great plant of the Appeal and totally destroyed it
BTS Which is another way of saying when their thinking is unacceptable Ernest answered and then went on
BTS 'Bout time you come growled the god of the car an hour later when Weedon Scott appeared at the door
BTS The press of the United States
BTS I cut out the race and the children
BTS He staggered to his feet and fell down
BTS Besides it was not the life of the herd or of the young bulls that was threatened
BTS I don't see that it would help matters if you too sat up and were chilled I laughed
BTS But he reassured himself with a glance down at his host a big man himself but dwarfed by the propinquity of the giant
BTS The other hunter Latimer a lean Yankee-looking fellow with shrewd narrow-slitted eyes held otherwise held that the seal pup was born on the land for no other reason than that it could not swim that its mother was compelled to teach it to swim as birds were compelled to teach their nestlings how to fly
BTS At the end of that time the lynx was devoured while the she-wolf's wounds had healed sufficiently to permit her to take the meat-trail again
BTS I amused myself with running over in my mind the sum of the fortunes represented and it ran well into the hundreds of millions
BTS One would conclude from this that under a capable management of society modern civilized man would be a great deal better off than the cave-man
BTS What if I should cry out loudly
BTS Always I hear it saying 'I did it I did it
BTS she queried teasingly
BTS To that intelligence there could be no objective knowledge of a body
BTS Denied the outlet through play of his energies he recoiled upon himself and developed his mental processes
BTS Another strike
BTS And yet I must say that Judge Caldwell did a whole lot to prevent my getting that very testimony
BTS Bishop Morehouse arose and abruptly began  It took but a few minutes to cross by ferry from Berkeley to San Francisco
BTS At least there would be no lid to the trap
BTS and the lips had answered Yes
BTS It is true we worked hard and for long hours
BTS Three hundredweight more than half a ton he weighed
BTS 2 the Pennsylvania railway group Schiff financial manager with big banking firms of Philadelphia and New York
BTS He waited at a distance
BTS This was a fearful blow to the socialist propaganda
BTS White Fang was disinclined to desert him
BTS please
BTS Dismay sat on their faces and before they could recover Ernest struck again
BTS No you don't
BTS twenty-two including the man at the wheel and myself
BTS Yes that's what I thought when everything went over the side
BTS Can't afford to
BTS Oh I know you're aboard he called out and I could see him listen intently after he had spoken
BTS So be it civil war was Mr
BTS He sat down beside White Fang holding the end of the thong in his hand
BTS Because I am a bigger bit of the ferment than you
BTS It would be impossible for me to write all that was said in the discussion
BTS You have eyes you have seen I answered almost brutally what of the pain and fear at my own heart
BTS I nodded my head and proceeded to make a flank attack on the nearest harem
BTS Possibly Beauty Smith arch-fiend and tormentor was capable of breaking White Fang's spirit but as yet there were no signs of his succeeding
BTS Charles and Hal begged her to get off and walk pleaded with her entreated the while she wept and importuned Heaven with a recital of their brutality
BTS Then he raised his voice
BTS He was not satisfied and he continued to smell the air striving to understand the message borne upon it to him
BTS Grey Beaver looked on stolidly while the white man wielded the whip
BTS He is a puppet
BTS The crime of not earning a living in their case is called vagrancy
BTS To this hoisting tackle I could if necessary attach a second hoisting tackle
BTS The cub had never seen man yet the instinct concerning man was his
BTS Three men with clubs were helping him to scatter them
BTS had gone up the steps and lain down to one side of the porch still growling and keeping a sullen watch on the intruder
BTS She fired six shots before they got her though what damage she did we could not know
BTS Which is all by the way for you are wrong
BTS Won't some of you help
BTS The Plutocracy with its paltry quarter of a million of occupied members
BTS That's what's botherin' me
BTS The front man turned his head until his eyes met the eyes of the man behind
BTS He crouched down on the lip of the cave and gazed out on the world
BTS I had not the experience to steer at the gait we were going on a quartering course
BTS Strangling suffocating sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other dragging over the jagged bottom smashing against rocks and snags they veered in to the bank
BTS It was the very essence of the unknown
BTS My face was against his chest and I could not see but I heard Maud turn and run swiftly away along the deck
BTS Maud made fast and returned to the windlass
BTS It's me and Johnson have to face the music
BTS Lip-lip excited by the chase and by the persistent nearness of his victim forgot caution and locality
BTS Nevertheless there was the mortgage properly and legally drawn up and signed with a record of the payments of interest through a number of years
BTS I am afraid the Church was dumb the Bishop confessed
BTS With nose serrulated by continuous spasms hair bristling in recurrent waves tongue whipping out like a red snake and whipping back again ears flattened down eyes gleaming hatred lips wrinkled back and fangs exposed and dripping he could compel a pause on the part of almost any assailant
BTS My cursed imagination saw her beaten and mangled against the rocks and it was too terrible
BTS As he went on his voice again grew soft and a confiding note came into it
BTS The next moment she was beside me
BTS In vain I objected and denied
BTS What does that mean
BTS I had cherished a hope that his victims would find an opportunity to escape while filling our water-barrels but Wolf Larsen had selected his spot well
BTS Matt paused halfway down the gang-plank
BTS I asked
BTS that he was glad there was an impending struggle
BTS and when he as a matter of course entered it both Perrault and Francois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils till he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold
BTS He hated the very wood of the pen that confined him
BTS Every odd moment he could find he had the knife and stone out and was whetting away
BTS Silence will mean agreement
BTS She dropped her head with her nose to the ground and directed toward a point near to her closely bunched feet and around this point she circled several times
BTS It's beyond me Matt Scott answered with a mournful shake of the head
BTS and then at last after the travail of the centuries will it be the day of the common man
BTS Garthwaite and I saw an example of this shortly after meeting with the young officer
BTS Scott turned upon Beauty Smith
BTS I was aroused by a clod of earth striking at my feet
BTS And yet I am wrong
BTS We did try to organize but independent dairymen always broke through us
BTS When he dozed upon his ears would steal the faint whispers of hidden trickles of running water and he would rouse and listen intently
BTS There was my father
BTS And through it all with a serenity and certitude that was terrifying continued to rise the form of that monster of the ages the Oligarchy
BTS That night when all was still White Fang remembered his mother and sorrowed for her
BTS In the summer the fish failed
BTS Ernest interrupted
BTS The fog's lifted an' 'tis the port light iv a steamer that's crossin' our bow this blessed minute
BTS He had not been made for the close confinement wild beasts endure at the hands of men
BTS The official permission to occupy Wake Robin Lodge is still on the records signed by no less a man than Wickson the minor oligarch of the Manuscript
BTS Garthwaite and the young officer fell into an animated conversation over the difference between so-called modern warfare and the present street-fighting and sky-scraper fighting that was taking place all over the city
BTS If it but knew the number of its own members who are our agents it would understand
BTS Then during this same period there was the case of Moyer and Haywood two strong fearless leaders of labor
BTS The front end of the sled was turned up like a scroll in order to force down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it
BTS I got the word fifteen minutes ago and I have already passed it along
BTS The hand descended
BTS I cried
BTS It was after such encounters that the dead and wounded were carted back to the towns and their places filled by men eager for the man-hunt
BTS The boat's bow plunged under a crest and we came through quarter-full of water
BTS Also the wives and families of the traitors were ostracized while the corner groceryman who sold provisions to them was boycotted
BTS There must be men and cruisers to protect them from the seal-hunters
BTS I asked a note of protest in my voice
BTS He had led his mother there step by step and now when she stopped he tried to inveigle her farther
BTS The rabbit sped down the river turned off into a small creek up the frozen bed of which it held steadily
BTS But the expression of Wolf Larsen's face never changed
BTS It's the only contraption that'll ever hold One Ear he said
BTS She seemed to smile at him showing her teeth in an ingratiating rather than a menacing way
BTS Never in his brief cave-life had he encountered anything of which to be afraid
BTS As at the time I caught her arm when helping her below so at any time I was quite prepared should stress or rough handling befall her to see her crumble away
BTS Before long we won't know where we are by five hundred miles
BTS Combination is stronger than competition
BTS Find out
BTS For a long time after his rescue Buck did not like Thornton to get out of his sight
BTS Yes sir the mate acknowledged submissively
BTS Mercedes was riding the loaded sled
BTS But why should there be a conflict
BTS And you have shown me I was right
BTS If you talked less with yer mouth and did something with yer hands he'd a-ben done with by now
BTS she asked turning to him and looking him squarely in the eyes
BTS Ernest called it the dinner of the Machine Breakers
BTS Then he licked his chops in quite the same way his mother did and began to crawl out of the bush
BTS Not that
BTS but it burned on in silence and darkness
BTS Her quickness matched his
BTS You will descend to us
BTS If for no other reason it was no time when one was protecting and trying to save a woman to ask that woman for her love
BTS The blows came faster heavier more shrewd to hurt
BTS I wanted to go through the university
BTS Everything was happening rapidly now
BTS Cherokee
BTS and despite the prohibition of the civil authorities and the persecution for disobedience the flames of religious frenzy were fanned by countless camp-meetings
BTS White Fang came to look forward eagerly to the gathering of the men around his pen
BTS At the rear limped the weak members the very young and the very old
BTS what chance of chances
BTS Why you'd not survive the night without blankets I know how strong you are
BTS he shouted
BTS Had he been full-grown he would have run away
BTS Out of your own mouths be it he said
BTS I asked incredulously
BTS No nevaire
BTS Couldn't tell who or what it was in the dark and just hit out
BTS They had not conceived it possible
BTS There lies Japan I remarked straight before us
BTS The Iron Heel could offer money leisure the joys and pleasures that waited in the repose of the wonder cities
BTS Mugridge's parting injunction as I left the galley with a big tea-pot in one hand and in the hollow of the other arm several loaves of fresh-baked bread
BTS Round and round and back again stumbling and falling and rising even uprearing at times on his hind-legs and lifting his foe clear of the earth he struggled vainly to shake off the clinging death
BTS There were the eaters and the eaten
BTS nor did the boldest of them ever dare to rob him of his meat
BTS I queried
BTS And just then I felt the whole man sink under me
BTS The wind died down in the afternoon and we were prepared to start the following morning
BTS And every time the hand descended the ears flattened down and a cavernous growl surged in his throat
BTS It has been maintained in a fair state of preservation and the curious visitor may to-day tread its labyrinths to the assembly hall where without doubt occurred the scene described by Avis Everhard
BTS It was in connection with the riding that White Fang achieved one other mode of expression remarkable in that he did it but twice in all his life
BTS This act of pointing put White Fang on his guard and when they tried to approach him he showed his teeth and backed away
BTS There was no answer
BTS At the office he had only professional feelings
BTS In dim ways he recognised in man the animal that had fought itself to primacy over the other animals of the Wild
BTS After the first rush each time his snarl kept the three dogs at a distance but they trailed along behind yelping and bickering and insulting him
BTS When I was a young man I was a soldier was his answer
BTS At that moment Biedenbach addressed me as Mary and I turned and answered him
BTS However I could see that the boldness of his language had affected Miss Brentwood
BTS We will hail you brothers and we will fight shoulder to shoulder in the cause of humanity
BTS Wolf Larsen alone remained
BTS Ask Captain Larsen I answered composedly and coldly though inwardly my blood was boiling at the thought that she should be witness to such brutality
BTS Don't ask me
BTS the Bishop cried
BTS I could see he didn't like it
BTS The other was lifting a megaphone to his lips
BTS She had discovered the china plate from which she was eating
BTS White Fang had already scented it
BTS Behind every steel-like contraction of a muscle lay another steel-like contraction and another and another apparently without end
BTS They merely charged illegality in the elections and wrapped up the whole situation in the interminable red tape of the law
BTS he asked
BTS The Ghost ploughed on her way
BTS And it was he that first gripped another cub by the ear and pulled and tugged and growled through jaws tight-clenched
BTS At one time in my life he continued after another pause I dreamed that I might some day talk with men who used such language that I might lift myself out of the place in life in which I had been born and hold conversation and mingle with men who talked about just such things as ethics
BTS I learned all that at college before you were born
BTS This is the fiat of evolution
BTS The day was like all the days
BTS Van Weyden how far we are off the coast and what the bearings of Yokohama are
BTS I would kill him for your sake
BTS It was no slight task
BTS And the highest finest right conduct I interjected is that act which benefits at the same time the man his children and his race
BTS A new wistfulness was in her face but it was not the wistfulness of hunger
BTS One of the potencies of whisky is the breeding of thirst
BTS and beneath my smile was the seriousness of the anxiety of love
BTS How Maud could stand it was beyond me
BTS I looked for my purse
BTS As I understood it there were two ways of getting it cleared first by lowering the foresail which was comparatively easy and without danger
BTS Many young men fled into the mountains to escape serving in the militia
BTS Hal was hurled backward as though struck by a falling tree
BTS The men outside shouted and applauded while Beauty Smith in an ecstasy of delight gloated over the ripping and mangling performed by White Fang
BTS There were hisses from the crowd and cries of protest but that was all
BTS The Plutocracy had passed sentence on him
BTS He was twenty pounds lighter but in splendid physical condition
BTS but in its wistfulness there was none of the dog affection
BTS Herford and Guinness were in it and they were blown to pieces along with the field into which they fell
BTS and in this White Fang grew wise with them
BTS I keep square all right with my own conscience
BTS I suppose I'll have to hire one somewhere
BTS It was probably the first time he had been aloft in his life
BTS --he with his clarion call and war-noted voice and all the fine man's vigor of him
BTS But at the moment of contact Thomas Mugridge cried out
BTS Calmly turning his back upon young dog and shin-bone as though both were beneath his notice and unworthy of his consideration he stalked grandly away
BTS Then the master took him into the chicken-yards
BTS There was glee in our eyes and suppressed titters in our mouths as we put on our shoes and clambered over the side into the boat
BTS Maud and I worked from dawn till dark to the limit of our strength so that when night came we crawled stiffly to bed and slept the animal-like sleep of exhaustion
BTS No telegraphic communication
BTS Sealing schooner after sealing schooner we sighted and boarded most of which were in search of lost boats and most of which were carrying boats and crews they had picked up and which did not belong to them
BTS He is the man that is
BTS The sight of her dear wet cheeks her flying hair and her brave brown eyes convinced me that my vision was still healthy
BTS We will hunt the bear
BTS Then we'll drop him over without any palavering unless our clerical-looking castaway has the burial service at sea by heart
BTS so 'elp me Gawd I didn't mean it
BTS But to return to Harrison
BTS His conclusion was that things were not always what they appeared to be
BTS At first this caused trouble for the other dogs
BTS You will have to speak louder
BTS But 'tis not a whisper I've dropped mind ye not a whisper
BTS Sad though this night's happening will be I feel that it will but draw you more closely to me
BTS He came of a breed of meat-killers and meat-eaters
BTS It is so stated in all the history books
BTS Wolf Larsen called up
BTS Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet
BTS Now and again I fitfully slept but the pain of the cold always aroused me
BTS I felt the same alarm that I had felt when James Smith broke out
BTS I know that I could not avoid dropping my eyes and I was quite relieved when I passed him on and turned to greet Bishop Morehouse--a favorite of mine a sweet and serious man of middle age Christ-like in appearance and goodness and a scholar as well
BTS Capital and labor added this value of one hundred dollars
BTS her unrest came back upon her and she knew again her pressing need to find the thing for which she searched
BTS Here I am I answered stepping to his side
BTS Take consolation in the fact that no member of your class has ever yet answered that charge
BTS he asked
BTS Asmunsen cried and many voices backed his decision
BTS He learned to adjust himself in many ways to his new mode of life
BTS So there was no damming up the tide of life that was rising within him rising with every mouthful of meat he swallowed with every breath he drew
BTS It was a strange meeting
BTS ' A different thing from class hatred he replied
BTS He whetted it up and down all day long
BTS but now I know that I shall never see it
BTS Danger lurked in contacts
BTS Both were eligible for the militia and both were drafted to serve in the punitive expedition that was despatched from California against the farmers of Missouri
BTS Here and there savage dogs rushed upon him but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled for he was learning fast and they let him go his way unmolested
BTS His puppyhood and the instinct of submission took charge of him
BTS As I emerged from the lazarette I heard sounds in Wolf Larsen's state-room
BTS He had no affection for Grey Beaver
BTS A few years later this would have been impossible because the passport system was to become so perfect that no man woman nor child in all the land was unregistered and unaccounted for in his or her movements
BTS The bow plunged down just missing me and sending a swash of water clear over my head
BTS His smiling good nature vanished like a ghost
BTS He felt that the ill done White Fang was a debt incurred by man and that it must be paid
BTS and the proletariat owns four per cent of the total wealth
BTS I heard the Bishop stumbling up the stairs and I opened the door
BTS You cannot deny it
BTS His money his position his culture could not save him
BTS But fear was accompanied by another instinct that of concealment
BTS He now saw it again
BTS Sentence of death had been passed and he was being led away
BTS Kill me
BTS A puppy alone by the river bank meant a puppy dead or a puppy that aroused the camp with its shrill pain and terror as it fled back from the wolf-cub that had waylaid it
BTS This accomplished he pried gently and carefully loosening the jaws a bit at a time while Matt a bit at a time extricated White Fang's mangled neck
BTS Successful in this the old simile of the needle in the haystack would be mild indeed compared with his brother's chance of finding him
BTS There they broke out in ever recurring mobs and riots
BTS His words brought anxiety into the faces of the other hunters
BTS Kowalt volunteered
BTS Childish and immaterial as the topic was the quality of their reasoning was still more childish and immaterial
BTS As soon as she put it on a flattering personal basis generosity compelled me to deny her
BTS His comrade looked at him curiously
BTS As he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the land
BTS But his strength ebbed his eyes glazed and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car
BTS Do you know that your smile is crooked
BTS But they were too widely scattered over the country to advantage from their own strength
BTS Therefore White Fang obeyed him
BTS And now I ask you again what are we going to do with those surpluses
BTS Disguise had to be fundamental intrinsic part and parcel of one's being second nature
BTS Heard you breathing of course
BTS Thereafter we looked with speculative comprehension at the windows
BTS It has never been my weakness to exalt the flesh far from it
BTS Maud received my report with obvious relief and the sight of smoke which later rose in the galley put her in a more cheerful mood
BTS He curved his bushy tail around to cover them and at the same time he saw a vision
BTS He did not formulate the law in clear set terms and moralise about it
BTS An unduly long summer would have been his thought had he thought about it
BTS You don't know all the ways out
BTS There are nearly a million coal miners
BTS You must make yourself over again so that even I would not know you--your voice your gestures your mannerisms your carriage your walk everything
BTS Of what use or sense is an immortality of piggishness
BTS Jordan
BTS He had had no headaches for weeks his eyes were clear blue as the sky his bronze was beautiful with perfect health
BTS All my heart seemed bursting with desire to fold my arms around him and to rest his head on my breast--his head that must be weary with so many thoughts
BTS You'd better get on your course then I chided
BTS Tell me where you live and I shall call later he said when he saw that I walked beside him and that it was my intention to stick to him now that he was found
BTS Many terrorist organizations unaffiliated with us sprang into existence and caused us much trouble
BTS With the suppression of the socialist publishing houses his meagre royalties ceased and he was hard-put to make a living
BTS So I say to you go ahead and preach and earn your pay but for goodness' sake leave the working class alone
BTS Landlordism would go crumbling
BTS I wouldn't stand for that he replied
BTS Among the terriers he stalked imperiously and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored for he was king king over all creeping crawling flying things of Judge Miller's place humans included
BTS Besides I shall do the clubbing
BTS The old unnamable terror mounted into her eyes
BTS Buck did not like it but he bore up well to the work taking pride in it after the manner of Dave and Sol-leks and seeing that his mates whether they prided in it or not did their fair share
BTS Sell them to countries with undeveloped resources Mr
BTS The newcomer turned upon the crowd
BTS That is the way profits are made Mr
BTS There was no stock
BTS And for a week this state of affairs was maintained
BTS But the first man on Mars would have experienced less unfamiliarity than did he
BTS Anything I can do for you
BTS But his demeanour toward me was more ferocious than ever
BTS Then I experimented with the sail
BTS But stay where you are and keep yer mouth shut
BTS In the days that followed as Dawson grew closer and closer Buck still continued to interfere between Spitz and the culprits
BTS Comrades turned traitor by permission in order to win to the wonder cities and there execute our sentences on the real traitors
BTS The Martinez heeled over sharply and there was a crashing and rending of timber
BTS The two men were compelled to run back to save the grub upon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team
BTS Thus as token of what a puppet thing life is the ancient song surged through him and he came into his own again
BTS Nevertheless the work of the country went on
BTS He was not homesick
BTS Everhard might have drawn a better illustration from the Southern Church's outspoken defence of chattel slavery prior to what is known as the War of the Rebellion
BTS White Fang sprang to his feet and tore wildly around trying to shake off the bull-dog's body
BTS England's hands were full
BTS but Buck was too clever ever again to be caught red-handed
BTS A tangled mass of women with drawn white faces and open mouths is shrieking like a chorus of lost souls
BTS Wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh they were countered by the fangs of Spitz
BTS Slave-levies for the rebuilding of Chicago Ernest said
BTS No you don't
BTS In the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country sad and silent where wildfowl had been but where then there was no life nor sign of life only the blowing of chill winds the forming of ice in sheltered places and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches
BTS Of course I answered
BTS There was plenty of food and no work in the Southland and White Fang lived fat and prosperous and happy
BTS He declared a vendetta against all dogs
BTS The coal at his feet dragged him down
BTS Matt took the rifle and began slowly to raise it to his shoulder
BTS He continued to gaze and in his interest he forgot to snarl
BTS But still I refused to believe
BTS but in her instinct which was the experience of all the mothers of wolves there lurked a memory of fathers that had eaten their new-born and helpless progeny
BTS She drew away obediently and then I thought What if she cannot find the steps
BTS The surface cars and the elevated were not running
BTS The toil of the traces seemed the supreme expression of their being and all that they lived for and the only thing in which they took delight
BTS It was merely the logical development of what in the nineteenth century had been known as grab-sharing
BTS As it was hour after hour day after day in endless train-loads by hundreds of thousands the Mercenaries were hurled into Chicago
BTS It might have been worse he smiled
BTS Therefore they proceeded to break the machines
BTS into other industrial companies
BTS Coming from no man knew where in the illimitable Pacific it was travelling north on its annual migration to the rookeries of Bering Sea
BTS His tufts of ears had become tassels his neck and shoulders were slashed in a score of places and his very lips were cut and bleeding all from these lightning snaps that were beyond his foreseeing and guarding
BTS She asked no further questions and I vouchsafed no remark devoting myself to Wolf Larsen's command which was to make her comfortable
BTS Go ahead Ernest encouraged
BTS Oh the wonder of the great trade-wind
BTS And so as he abandoned his rush at her and braced himself to avoid the contact she sprang upon him
BTS And yet you would break those machines
BTS Labor was striking here there and everywhere
BTS In the United States Census of 1900 the last census the figures of which were made public the number of child laborers was placed at 1752187
BTS He was very much alive very happy and very proud of himself
BTS The Rockefellers went into mines--iron and coal and copper and lead
BTS A little later in our conversation I asked him a simple little question about the liability of workingmen to accidents and received a statistical lecture in return
BTS An' 'tis with wonder I'm filled as to the workin' out iv things
BTS He was standing in the companion-way only his head and shoulders visible staring straight at me
BTS Once lying awake he heard a strange sound in the white wall
BTS What are you doing
BTS It is because of this life that is in you that you dream of your immortality
BTS Here in the abandoned lair he settled down and rested for a day
BTS I sat in the gallery that day
BTS There was a leap a flash of teeth a sharp exclamation
BTS Labor in all these countries has spent its wages and cannot buy any of the surpluses
BTS I know though I didn't spot him at it
BTS Aft I walked to the cabin companion where I contented myself with hailing below
BTS Then he would cast a glance of fear at the wolf-circle drawn expectantly about him and like a blow the realisation would strike him that this wonderful body of his this living flesh was no more than so much meat a quest of ravenous animals to be torn and slashed by their hungry fangs to be sustenance to them as the moose and the rabbit had often been sustenance to him
BTS It was a gala day
BTS I asked gently
BTS A period wherein science was raped by the metaphysicians wherein physics became a search for the Philosopher's Stone wherein chemistry became alchemy and astronomy became astrology
BTS great straining horses pulling huge trucks
BTS Here and there he could see one curled up in the snow like a dog taking the sleep that was now denied himself
BTS From every side the cries arose and the dogs betrayed their fear by huddling together and so close to the fire that their hair was scorched by the heat
BTS Our comrades sought him everywhere
BTS Out of others
BTS Only there is a hitch
BTS They're scattered an' rangin' along wide he said keeping up with us an' lookin' for game at the same time
BTS For how can a man with thrilling and burning and exaltation recite the following and still be mere mortal earth a bit of fugitive force an evanescent form
BTS Jordan has stated it very clearly Ernest said
BTS Removing the wads from the latter with my knife I emptied the powder on a flat rock
BTS Van Weyden Wolf Larsen commanded
BTS Life was soft and easy
BTS As he stopped to meet me he betrayed a certain slight awkwardness that was strangely at variance with his bold-looking eyes and his firm sure hand that clasped for a moment in greeting
BTS A laugh went up at my appearance a laugh that was not lessened or softened by the dead man stretched and grinning on the deck before us
BTS Then Jim Hall went to his living death
BTS I asked
BTS Leave the present battle to youth and strength
BTS Then I gave Maud careful instructions for lowering away and went into the hold to the step on the schooner's bottom
BTS I do believe his whine was congenital
BTS Besides all my brother critics were with me
BTS Fear urged him to go back but growth drove him on
BTS Here Colonel Van Gilbert writhed in his chair
BTS Sleep was welling up and gripping him again his head was sinking down upon his knees when he roused with a sudden start
BTS He aroused in them their instinctive fear of the Wild and they greeted him always with snarl and growl and belligerent hatred
BTS It was quite a scramble down to the stream bed and once on the bed we went down stream perhaps for a hundred feet
BTS so let us for the sake of convenience make them roughly approximate
BTS A mile northwest from the wooded knolls brings one to the site of Wake Robin Lodge at the junction of Wild-Water and Sonoma Creeks
BTS Their irritability arose out of their misery increased with it doubled upon it outdistanced it
BTS He was better fitted for the life than the other dogs for he had the training of his cubhood to guide him
BTS But what can you do
BTS And with Hearst crashed also to destruction the Democratic Party that he had so recently captured
BTS She was like a feather in my arms so slender so ethereal
BTS White Fang was torn by conflicting feelings impulses
BTS Cherokee wagged the stump of his tail in advertisement that he understood the meaning of the blows but that he knew he was himself in the right and only doing his duty by keeping his grip
BTS Inside
BTS Never shall I forget the night when after a hot discussion with half a dozen labor leaders Ernest turned to me and said quietly That settles it
BTS Now had not the moose come down to drink had not Mit-sah been steering out of the course because of the snow had not Kloo-kooch sighted the moose and had not Grey Beaver killed it with a lucky shot from his rifle all subsequent things would have happened differently
BTS So he stepped boldly out upon the air
BTS They were crowded with ragged unskilled laborers people of the abyss
BTS but from my lofty perch I looked down as though outside the Ghost and apart from her and saw the shape of her outlined sharply against the foaming sea as she tore along instinct with life
BTS How was it added
BTS And even he could not repress a start and an involuntary bristling of hair along his back when she suddenly leaped without warning straight up in the air at the same time emitting a long and most terrible squall
BTS No more bombs fell from the windows the last pedestrians seemed to have vanished from the streets and our immediate quietude grew more profound
BTS I knew not how and yet I had been looking directly at it
BTS that could snap and crackle points of fire like those which sparkle from a whirling sword
BTS When the signal was given from every refuge all over the land and from the cities and towns and barracks devoted comrades were to go forth and blow up the wireless stations
BTS What of his bushwhacking and waylaying tactics the young dogs were afraid to run by themselves
BTS Some of the coal dust had coated his face and the sweat from his exertions was running in streaks
BTS Maud clapped her hands gleefully
BTS It is due to his whim that I am still alive
BTS Calvin paused a moment
BTS And I could see their wan white hands from which the blood had been pressed at work upon the cloth out of which had been made my gown
BTS But when you squeal you don't state the situation flatly as I have stated it
BTS It was aimed against every workingman who was maimed in the mills
BTS I looked at my watch
BTS Not only did it not stand them in good stead but it destroyed them
BTS Old One Eye was not interested at all but he followed her good-naturedly in her quest and when her investigations in particular places were unusually protracted he would lie down and wait until she was ready to go on
BTS White Fang had never seen such a dog it was a mastiff
BTS No more was Spitz a leader greatly to be feared
BTS But no help was offered
BTS He swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life
BTS Once in the fastnesses they promised and the two men could defy Wolf Larsen
BTS I heard of a man once who invaded the nesting grounds of wild geese Maud said
BTS The next I knew after that I was awakened out of a sound sleep by a man who walked up and down close beside me
BTS As for snarling he could snarl more terribly than any dog young or old in camp
BTS I found nothing but stupidity except for business
BTS Half a block down another building opened fire on us
BTS Quite as though it had been a long-established custom of his he struck out with all his legs and began to swim
BTS Nothing was to be seen of his chest however for it was covered with a mass of black hair in appearance like the furry coat of a dog
BTS Then they turned to White Fang
BTS Take him away Scott commanded and Tim Keenan dragged Cherokee back into the crowd
BTS It is because you are not a trust
BTS Yet we were fair
BTS This was warfare in that modern jungle a great city
BTS Wolf Larsen pursed his lips in a long quizzical whistle
BTS There were live things and things not alive
BTS Van Weyden speaks with the voice of authority Wolf Larsen laughed
BTS My feet went out from under me
BTS Oh Van Weyden
BTS And by this I do not wish to be misunderstood
BTS His brows were bright with the divine that was in him and brighter yet shone his eyes from the midst of the radiance that seemed to envelop him as a mantle
BTS White Fang knew why he was being beaten
BTS The blankets in the other bunk stirred irritably
BTS It was indeed a twisted smile for it was on the left side only the facial muscles of the right side moving not at all
BTS I take it as proof that Berkeley's metaphysics did not work because-- Ernest paused calmly for a moment
BTS A modern hero
BTS You cannot pick it up in your two hands and look at it
BTS His test of truth is 'Will it work
BTS He became cunning
BTS He smelled the meat carefully
BTS She compelled obedience from him and the older he grew the shorter grew her temper
BTS And she would probably be in San Francisco in five or six hours
BTS Or do I have to take you in hand
BTS I asked
BTS No Wolf Larsen answered with an indescribable air of sadness
BTS At half-past three in the afternoon we passed the south-western promontory
BTS I would make it well
BTS Sooner or later he is going to break out and then there's going to be a smash-up
BTS Then he prepared to saw across with the draw-knife
BTS His clutch was broken
BTS I looked at Wolf Larsen
BTS Being a female she possessed no such instinct
BTS but did not my brother tie her out in the woods all of three nights in the mating season
BTS ' And as he spoke he extended from his splendid shoulders his two great arms and the horseshoer's hands were clutching the air like eagle's talons
BTS And then we played hide-and-seek with the blind man
BTS At first father laughed
BTS But we are not so made
BTS And I'm that hungry he added I could eat cobblestones
BTS I asked Wolf Larsen unable longer to keep my curiosity in check
BTS The boat was close-hauled on a fresh breeze and the compass indicated that we were just making the course which would bring us to Japan
BTS Thank Gawd she's not comin' all of a bunch Mr
BTS He saw himself caught in the web and he tried to escape from it
BTS Give 'm time
BTS but to the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to crouch at man's feet this grief has never come
BTS Half a mile of the mob had swept by when we were discovered
BTS Late in the afternoon I sighted a steamer's smoke on the horizon to leeward and I knew it either for a Russian cruiser or more likely the Macedonia still seeking the Ghost
BTS She stitched slowly but never did she cease from stitching
BTS As he had howled in his puppy days when he fled back from the Wild to the village to find it vanished and naught but a rubbish-heap to mark the site of Grey Beaver's tepee so now he pointed his muzzle to the cold stars and told to them his woe
BTS So the Trust took your profits away from you Ernest said and you've gone into politics in order to legislate the Trust out of existence and get the profits back
BTS Japan dominated the East and took to herself the whole Asiatic portion of the world-market with the exception of India
BTS Except for the final consummation the old order had passed away and the final consummation was nearer than I dreamed
BTS He was the soul of it and how can I possibly separate the two in thought
BTS and it was with a great relief that I again emerged on deck and went aft to the cabin
BTS I cannot sit idly by and wait the great event that is his making though he is not here to see
BTS Slacking away on the boom-tackle and hoisting an equivalent amount on the shears-tackle I brought the butt of the mast into position directly over the hole in the deck
BTS The psychology of it is sadly tangled and yet I could read the workings of his mind as clearly as though it were a printed book
BTS Look at 'm
BTS The battle is not always to the strong
BTS Here leading up the left fork he came upon a fresh track
BTS The creative joy I murmured
BTS The penalty for failure was death
BTS He never left this cell
BTS The unnecessary noise he made I had lain wide-eyed the whole night must have awakened one of the hunters
BTS Men were shaking hands it did not matter with whom and bubbling over in a general incoherent babel
BTS You may go for'ard and turn in I said taking it from him
BTS And here's what happened to her
BTS Farley and his gang will be promoted to slave-driving
BTS If labor wins your way will be easy
BTS Though never permitted by his mother to approach that wall he had approached the other walls and encountered hard obstruction on the end of his tender nose
BTS Together they watched the strange animal that had pursued them for days and that had already accomplished the destruction of half their dog-team
BTS But I did see the balloon suddenly leap up into the sky
BTS It had been reported to the Speaker of the House by secret-service agents of the government that the Socialist Congressmen were about to resort to terroristic tactics and that they had decided upon the day when their tactics would go into effect
BTS and love
BTS Then she will not do any more work
BTS What I needed was rest if it were ever to get well
BTS You are even more stupid than the stupid workmen of England
BTS His spirit was too gentle
BTS You see all those books
BTS Then inside other fences were the particular domains of other gods
BTS and these with the exception of the part-grown puppies were likewise burdened with camp outfit
BTS he cried
BTS Four times he had covered the distance between Salt Water and Dawson and the knowledge that jaded and tired he was facing the same trail once more made him bitter
BTS The frost was in his feet and he kept lifting first one fore-foot and then the other
BTS The Sounding of the Call When Buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for John Thornton he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts and to journey with his partners into the East after a fabled lost mine the history of which was as old as the history of the country
BTS They were simply so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly
BTS As we passed the point the whole cove burst upon our view a half-moon of white sandy beach upon which broke a huge surf and which was covered with myriads of seals
BTS But a voice behind me the unmistakable voice of Wolf Larsen strong with the invincible certitude of the man and mellow with appreciation of the words he was quoting aroused me
BTS The first conspicuous excursion and incursion of the Rockefellers was into the railway field
BTS It is a shame I heard Johnson growling in painfully slow and correct English
BTS The very thing
BTS That Wolf Larsen had turned the liquor loose among his men surprised me but he evidently knew their psychology and the best method of cementing in cordiality what had begun in bloodshed
BTS He crawled over to his mate and tried to persuade her to get up
BTS He thrust her off with his shoulder and his retreat cut off and still intent on regaining the sled he altered his course in an attempt to circle around to it
BTS he gritted out
BTS The life that is in you is alive and wants to go on being alive for ever
BTS The whip flashed out here and there on its merciless errands
BTS but I learned now that I had never comprehended the deeper significance of such a situation the thing the writers harped upon and exploited so thoroughly
BTS They walked always in the middle of the street
BTS Also to be reckoned with was the immediateness of his attack
BTS Always he was on the lookout for the trail of the gods where it might leave the river and proceed inland
BTS Not that he did this consciously however
BTS Insolent
BTS And then when all was ready appeared upon the scene the soldiers of the United States who were in reality the soldiers of the Iron Heel
BTS Fair wind
BTS It would be better I imagine if you let harems alone and devoted your attention to lonely and inoffensive-looking seals was what she said
BTS His mastery was rigid as steel
BTS He had a feeling that the testimony of the foremen and the superintendent had brought about the adverse decision of the court
BTS He too had seen it the Macedonia guessing his manoeuvre and failing by a moment in anticipating it
BTS He nodded agreement when I had given the definition
BTS and such was his forward momentum and the unexpectedness of it White Fang was hurled to the ground and rolled clear over
BTS Keep your eye on Knowlton
BTS ' 'Section Eight that courts martial for the trial of officers or men of the militia shall be composed of militia officers only
BTS he asked looking at me searchingly
BTS Where is the line between wrong mind and insane mind
BTS Garthwaite held me by the arm and we pressed close against the front of a building
BTS Yet all three animals were keyed to a tenseness of living that was almost painful and scarcely ever would it come to them to be more alive than they were then in their seeming petrifaction
BTS One great factor that helped to swell the socialist vote was the destruction of Hearst
BTS A few minutes later Henry who was now travelling behind the sled emitted a low warning whistle
BTS Shall I look for him in the steerage sir
BTS The one thing of which he had always been particularly jealous was his head
BTS He did not know anything about this law for it was no generalisation of the mind not a something acquired by experience of the world
BTS For several hours he adhered to this programme
BTS But we may be picked up any moment by a sealing-schooner
BTS And I I said quickly
BTS It was all I could do to keep from groaning aloud
BTS As she is going in the opposite direction she is very probably bound for San Francisco
BTS If our five boats do as well as you and I have done we'll have a pretty full crew Wolf Larsen said to me
BTS Later the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the forest
BTS And they made themselves many inventions I began merrily then paused to sniff the air
BTS Wolf Larsen was really the cause of it
BTS He had opened up for me the world of the real of which I had known practically nothing and from which I had always shrunk
BTS Prices were now deliberately pressed down to bankruptcy while the railroads with extortionate rates broke the back of the farmer-camel
BTS When the oligarchs have completely mastered the people they will have time to spare for other things
BTS Father reported with glee Dr
BTS Wolf Larsen cried and the hunter dropped it as though it were hot and had burned him
BTS Confess now in warning me for my own good that you are very consistent
BTS And who is the captain
BTS This I discovered when she nearly fell into the bunk during a sudden lurch of the schooner
BTS Every muscle every fibre every cell was tired dead tired
BTS Go on they urged and Dr
BTS I'm takin' 'm up for the boss to 'Frisco
BTS Lashing the two topmasts together and making allowance for their unequal length at the point of intersection I attached the double block of the main throat-halyards
BTS And it's slack off the sheets for Japan
BTS Cherokee identified himself with his instinct
BTS There are three big classes in society
BTS Through our secret service we ransacked every prison in the land
BTS As the roar of the bombs died away he began peering out
BTS she was not strong
BTS But to-night I'm Number 27 of the 'Frisco Reds
BTS But as birds flew in the air squirrels could climb trees and the cub could only try to crawl unobserved upon the squirrel when it was on the ground
BTS You do me proud Hump
BTS Yet it was given him to discover a third way
BTS White Fang allowed all the members of the family to pet him and make much of him
BTS Understand
BTS His body was slender and rangy and his strength more stringy than massive His coat was the true wolf-grey and to all appearances he was true wolf himself
BTS I suppose up to now your lawyer has done it for you or your business agent
BTS And in this his brothers and sisters were one with him
BTS And how good it was
BTS The door swung open and he came forth
BTS The tent was rolled into an awkward bundle three times as large as it should have been
BTS You have to be very careful as to how you spend your earnings I suggested
BTS As he had been robbed of his money so was he now robbed of his home
BTS To remedy this he ate as fast as they
BTS Over the city of the Mercenaries we saw a great captive war-balloon that burst even as we looked at it and fell in flaming wreckage toward the earth
BTS They will be like the guards of the palace in old Rome and there will be palace revolutions whereby the labor castes will seize the reins of power
BTS A little later I heard the stroke of oars growing nearer and nearer and the calls of a man
BTS I could hear the wind above
BTS After a few hours of waiting when daylight had come the audience and the dog with which he was to fight arrived
BTS It was about us veiling and hiding us in its dense wet gauze
BTS It was farm-bred and fat and tender
BTS And borne upon the necks of men I saw Like some great God the Holy Lord of Rome
BTS And bringing them over the air-line--that means business
BTS Sling yer 'ook
BTS But with the sheep-dog it was otherwise
BTS I noticed the anxious light in Johnson's eyes but mistook it for the native shyness and embarrassment of the man
BTS He whined about the testimony
BTS Insolent
BTS It was an involuntary bristling on his part the physical state that in the past had always accompanied the mental state produced in him by Lip-lip's bullying and persecution
BTS But he won't pull those chaps around from the look of it he added pointing at the Macedonia's third boat for which I had been steering and which was now nearly abreast of us
BTS Perhaps the jaw was too large
BTS I winked off just this very minute sir
BTS His paper will always circulate at par
BTS She pecked him again and again
BTS And as she had followed the trend of my silence she now followed the trend of my speech and she knew that I was going aboard not because of condensed milk and marmalade but because of her and of her anxiety which she knew she had failed to hide
BTS He sat down
BTS But since you say that you were voyaging to Japan for your health I can assure you that it will improve no better anywhere than aboard the Ghost
BTS Chicago was true to her traditions and though a generation of revolutionists was wiped out it took along with it pretty close to a generation of its enemies
BTS How can I ever trust you again
BTS But scarcely had the cheer of its light departed than he went into camp
BTS And they smoked incessantly smoked using a coarse cheap and offensive-smelling tobacco
BTS And even after fatigue came his heritage of endurance braced him to endless endeavour and enabled him to drive his complaining body onward
BTS Pitched battles had been fought with the small armies of armed strike-breakers put in the field by the employers' associations
BTS You can go to hell sir
BTS The only discussion--and that arose afterward--was when we should be married
BTS White Fang received the nursing
BTS Furthermore he got over being awkward and self-conscious
BTS Everybody save Beauty Smith looked apprehensively the fear of the police strong upon them
BTS The camp-sounds came to his ears
BTS All is vanity and vexation of spirit' There is no profit under the sun' There is one event unto all' to the fool and the wise the clean and the unclean the sinner and the saint and that event is death and an evil thing he says
BTS Now I who am only a sailor would look upon the situation somewhat differently
BTS Damp and soggy where it was not sharp and rocky buffeted by storm winds and lashed by the sea with the air continually a-tremble with the bellowing of two hundred thousand amphibians it was a melancholy and miserable sojourning-place
BTS If he has liberty he may do anything
BTS How could his answers be damaging if he had the right on his side
BTS In this time of misery White Fang too stole away into the woods
BTS That slight awkwardness
BTS But Weedon Scott was not listening
BTS Tim Keenan stepped in and bent over Cherokee fondling him on both sides of the shoulders with hands that rubbed against the grain of the hair and that made slight pushing-forward movements
BTS As Kiche when with the wolves had lured out to destruction dogs from the camps of men so White Fang in manner somewhat similar lured Lip-lip into Kiche's avenging jaws
BTS Together they crashed to the floor
BTS I could see he was working rapidly with his hands
BTS The boat flirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up while Thornton flung sheer out of it was carried down-stream toward the worst part of the rapids a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live
BTS He slowed down to an alert and mincing walk and then stopped
BTS Van Weyden is what you may call an authority on such things as rights
BTS I have made the acquaintance of another one of the crew Louis he is called a rotund and jovial-faced Nova Scotia Irishman and a very sociable fellow prone to talk as long as he can find a listener
BTS They were the saviours of humanity and they regarded themselves as heroic and sacrificing laborers for the highest good
BTS Everywhere was a thick litter of discarded and ragged garments old sea-boots leaky oilskins all the worthless forecastle dunnage of a long voyage
BTS Besides Kiche was well-nigh forgotten
BTS That by your own word is why you are no longer in the dairy business
BTS These associations were practically middle-class affairs and now compelled by hard times and crashing markets and aided by the great captains of industry they gave organized labor an awful and decisive defeat
BTS The next instant he was grappling with Buck on the extreme edge while Hans and Pete were dragging them back into safety
BTS Tragedy had dwindled the farce had begun
BTS And just then he gave a snort and a snarl and rushed at me
BTS Later on when he had travelled more and grown older and wiser and come to know more of trails and rivers it might be that he could grasp and apprehend such a possibility
BTS The whole Water Front Federation along with its allies in the structural trades had backed up the teamsters and all had been smashed down ingloriously
BTS Of course the newspapers made no mention of it
BTS but the spirit of something I had seen before was strong upon me impelling me to give service to Wolf Larsen as Wolf Larsen had once given service to another man
BTS And all the while the she-wolf sat on her haunches and smiled
BTS Tim Keenan strode into the ring
BTS on the other hand it even gives you delight
BTS Of this last Buck was never guilty though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man and wagged their tails and licked his hand
BTS The hunters fell silent as clams
BTS I had become convinced that Ernest was right when he sneered at charity as a poulticing of an ulcer
BTS I reasoned that a helpless man could start a fire only near to where he lay
BTS I looked at her
BTS What do you think of that
BTS The scene often came back to Buck to trouble him in his sleep
BTS Wolf Larsen and Johansen were all about the poor fellow
BTS Fang clashed fang and lips were cut and bleeding but Buck could not penetrate his enemy's guard
BTS But for some time longer he sat and brooded the two remaining dogs crouching and trembling at his feet
BTS and in roar of shell and shrapnel and in whine of machine-guns shall our answer be couched
BTS To such extremity were the gods driven that they ate the soft-tanned leather of their mocassins and mittens while the dogs ate the harnesses off their backs and the very whip-lashes
BTS But if we are immortal what is the reason for this
BTS Van Weyden Wolf Larsen said as I came on the poop
BTS I involuntarily cried
BTS He gave a short chuckle
BTS No
BTS White Fang ceased only when he had tired himself out
BTS Running at the forefront of the pack was a large grey wolf one of its several leaders
BTS So long as you exist there is a vital need for hell-fire in the Cosmos
BTS while the rest of the crew lived the lives of dogs and were worked like dogs by their pitiless master
BTS Van Weyden stand by to pass the head-sails over
BTS Ballingford achieved quite different fates from that of Jackson
BTS I knew what you had come for
BTS Nevertheless the socialist landslide occurred
BTS The slop-chest is a sort of miniature dry-goods store which is carried by all sealing schooners and which is stocked with articles peculiar to the needs of the sailors
BTS And so exalted upborne by a sense of power I turned my back on the howling inferno and climbed to the deck where the fog drifted ghostly through the night and the air was sweet and pure and quiet
BTS He could get little air and that little grew less and less under the merciless grip that ever tightened
BTS Do you know I am filled with a strange uplift
BTS Each dog was fastened to the sled by a single rope
BTS It can be taken away from you
BTS It was deadly fighting
BTS Coward that I might be I was less a coward than he
BTS Down with you
BTS Across Marsh Tagish and Bennett seventy miles of lakes they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to run towed behind the sled at the end of a rope
BTS You can do it
BTS It was planned that they should be delivered simultaneously
BTS She was snarling as she ran
BTS Ben with the wolves all that time
BTS he demanded
BTS As with the running mate on the left she repelled these attentions with her teeth
BTS They growled and barked like detestable dogs mewed and flapped their arms and crowed
BTS If she comes out of there he said hard and snappy putting us to windward of the boats it's likely there'll be empty bunks in steerage and fo'c'sle
BTS Here was first considered the stand the socialists were to take
BTS The blankets were soaking
BTS I pointed out that modern man's producing power through social organization and the use of machinery was a thousand times greater than that of the cave-man
BTS It was my own phrase my pet secret phrase my love phrase for her
BTS For the second and last time in his life he had barked and made himself understood
BTS They invaded the entrance killing the wounded and searching out the unhurt that like ourselves were playing dead
BTS He had killed this god's dog bitten his companion god and what else was to be expected than some terrible punishment
BTS He saved himself by springing back the jaws snapping together a scant six inches from his thigh
BTS Lonely he had lived so far as his kind was concerned and lonely he would continue to live
BTS to be fed upon to be carrion to yield up all the strength and movement of my muscles that it may become strength and movement in fin and scale and the guts of fishes
BTS they are made to show honor to those who have lost the sense even of shame
BTS Their method was one of assertion assumption and denunciation
BTS His comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied the work that killed it and recalled instances they had known where dogs too old for the toil or injured had died because they were cut out of the traces
BTS And in that moment his eyes were just as steady and sure
BTS They patronized the university and the churches and the pastors especially bowed at their knees in meek subservience
BTS There was one other man who was quizzed by Ernest at this juncture a Mr
BTS He knew too well my sympathy for the runaways to send me aloft as look-out
BTS This was the end of the Appeal
BTS He was whining softly and as Buck whined they touched noses
BTS The last tie was broken
BTS And when I had expended some thirty shells for three seals I decided that the ammunition would be exhausted before I acquired the necessary knowledge
BTS I'll show 'em to you
BTS The Irishman wavered
BTS He learned to sneak about camp to be crafty to know what was going on everywhere to see and to hear everything and to reason accordingly and successfully to devise ways and means of avoiding his implacable persecutor
BTS There was a movement of the hand above him
BTS He came out boldly from the forest and trotted into camp straight to Grey Beaver's tepee
BTS It is unselfish as opposed to an act performed for self which is selfish
BTS Let us go on
BTS they were slack and absent-minded in their service and they whispered gloomily to one another in the far end of the car next to the kitchen
BTS It was a harness such as he had seen the grooms put on the horses at home
BTS An' I don't want no boat-pullin' in mine
BTS Our minds revolted
BTS The vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more frequently now that there was little work to be done
BTS As regards their political and governmental power I'll take that up later along with the political and governmental power of the whole middle class
BTS She is also patriotic
BTS Then the business game is to make profits out of others and to prevent others from making profits out of you
BTS Wolf Larsen queried his voice soft and low and purring
BTS But whatever idea was forming in his mind was dissipated by the she-wolf who advanced upon him sniffed noses with him for a fleeting instant and then resumed her coy retreat before his renewed advances
BTS Then while some broke camp others harnessed the dogs and they were under way an hour or so before the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn
BTS but haply it may not be the change the bear anticipates
BTS It crushed them with the weight of unending vastness and unalterable decree
BTS The old and the weak of them died of hunger
BTS And just now the word has gone forth that new levies are being imposed for the building of Asgard the projected wonder-city that will far exceed Ardis when the latter is completed
BTS But I was angry with Wolf Larsen
BTS He whirled over fetching the ground on his back and side
BTS I think the tundra grass will make just as good a roof she said
BTS I'll wager I know what you were reprimanded for Ernest said
BTS At this moment as he opened his mouth to speak puff after puff struck the schooner and pressed her side under
BTS He braced his legs and feet pressing the cabin floor with his toes in a clutching sort of way
BTS She never gave him a moment's peace
BTS How did you happen to get your arm caught in the machine
BTS Spring came on once more and at the end of all their wandering they found not the Lost Cabin but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan
BTS At other times I take him for a great man a genius who has never arrived
BTS But have you thought of the other living things
BTS It works
BTS He interrupted again and again with comment and criticism
BTS Mugridge's brutality to me was paid back in kind and with interest
BTS Having let them have their say Ernest began asking questions right and left
BTS One thousand dollars if you take me ashore
BTS Cherokee might well have been disembowelled had he not quickly pivoted on his grip and got his body off of White Fang's and at right angles to it
BTS They were all about us thicker than I had ever seen them before in twos and threes and bunches stretched full length on the surface and sleeping for all the world like so many lazy young dogs
BTS Only what
BTS I had observed Henderson and Smoke loitering about the deck all morning and I now learned why they were there
BTS Here is a man who wants to say get drunk
BTS Oh Lord
BTS I had never before seen him stripped and the sight of his body quite took my breath away
BTS Here at last was something ready to hand
BTS The mere sight of Beauty Smith was sufficient to send him into transports of fury
BTS I knew you on the instant
BTS hot coffee
BTS You have now become a yardstick yourself
BTS I turned aside caught my breath and looked again
BTS The suppression of the book is a precipitation
BTS Johnson's breath suddenly expelled shot from his mouth and as suddenly checked with the forced audible expiration of a man wielding an axe
BTS The hand was dead
BTS We've got three cartridges
BTS In those days so sparsely populated was the land that wild animals often became pests
BTS In the scramble one of the dogs had been overturned on the edge of the fire and it had yelped with pain and fright as the smell of its singed coat possessed the air
BTS and with every thong and sled lashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope the dogs were hoisted one by one to the cliff crest
BTS They tied my arms while they lived
BTS The incumbents refused to get out
BTS Three hundred dollars he answered
BTS They had eaten a pair of Perrault's moose-hide moccasins chunks out of the leather traces and even two feet of lash from the end of Francois's whip
BTS The man-animals were gods unmistakable and unescapable
BTS If one doesn't get you the other will
BTS Not only had this law been forcibly and many times impressed on him by his mother's nose and paw but in him the instinct of fear was developing
BTS He was never disturbed over why a thing happened
BTS I tell you we are on the verge of the unknown he insisted
BTS Too much 'Frisco tanglefoot for the health of my crew
BTS Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles
BTS Fresh upon his months of mastery over his own team-mates it was beyond his self-control to stand idly by while another devoured the meat that belonged to him
BTS the futility of so noble a soul as the Bishop will show you the compulsion for such harshness
BTS Nevertheless in violation of the national and state constitutions and by means of conspiracy on the parts of the governors of Idaho and Colorado Moyer and Haywood were kidnapped thrown into jail and charged with the murder
BTS Now that we've everything cleaned up we'll have the funeral and get the decks cleared of useless lumber
BTS Kill me
BTS Wolf Larsen repeated his manoeuvre holding off and then rounding up to windward and drifting down upon it
BTS and when he called me his sweet metaphysician I called him my immortal materialist
BTS And as shipwright and able assistant she laughed back
BTS But though he worked in the sled in the day White Fang did not forego the guarding of his master's property in the night
BTS The planet is only so large
BTS It is fanned as by a wind by sight of the thing desired or by a new and luring description or comprehension of the thing desired
BTS Answer the indictment that I and my fifteen hundred thousand comrades have brought against your class and you
BTS Everything had happened at once the blow the counter-blow the squeal of agony from the porcupine the big cat's squall of sudden hurt and astonishment
BTS The distance had been measured off and as he neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards a cheer began to grow and grow which burst into a roar as he passed the firewood and halted at command
BTS And without asking Whither hurried hence
BTS An' with a gyme leg at that
BTS They were eyes that masked the soul with a thousand guises and that sometimes opened at rare moments and allowed it to rush up as though it were about to fare forth nakedly into the world on some wonderful adventure eyes that could brood with the hopeless sombreness of leaden skies
BTS On the 4th of December the American minister was withdrawn from the German capital
BTS Still another figure arises out of the old life--Jackson's lawyer
BTS It is hard to maintain one's dignity under such circumstances
BTS I noticed a private car on the rear
BTS Nobody seemed interested in the wantonly imperilled life
BTS They played for money
BTS Yet it is upon feeling more often than thinking that animals act
BTS White Fang's teeth drove into the scrawny throat
BTS His body bunched together as though for a spring and his face became as an infuriated beast's as he snarled It's a  A what
BTS The boy metamorphosed into a savage on the instant
BTS The three men were bailing
BTS After that I don't give a rap what happens
BTS The Ghost was hove to
BTS There were cats at the houses the master visited that must be let alone
BTS If I was I wouldn't be on the outside starving and taking cases like Jackson's
BTS He was a carnivorous animal
BTS A transformation came over me
BTS Wickson
BTS Charles sat down on a log to rest
BTS ' Just like that he said it 'Well I'll be damned
BTS As courier for the Canadian Government bearing important despatches he was anxious to secure the best dogs and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of Buck
BTS I learned it myself in English ships
BTS Could it be that some glimmer of vision remained to him
BTS The twelve o'clock dinner was over one day and I had just finished putting the cabin in order when Wolf Larsen and Thomas Mugridge descended the companion stairs
BTS He was appalled
BTS I think he only half lived after all
BTS It was very secret I answered
BTS In consequence it held the boat bow on to the sea and wind the safest position in which to escape being swamped when the sea is breaking into whitecaps
BTS It was terrible
BTS but when the moving shadow fell across his face I saw at once that he was susceptible to the impression
BTS Some time ago you were fighting the Milk Trust Ernest said to him
BTS She dropped on her knees before Buck with tears in her eyes and put her arms around his neck
BTS He had begun to limp and this limp increased with the hours
BTS He had seen dogs change owners in the past and he had seen the runaways beaten as he was being beaten
BTS Yes I'm going with you so you may as well secure the boat and arm me with a club
BTS It was a distinct victory I had gained and I refused to forego any of it by shaking his detestable hand
BTS It smelled sour and musty and by the dim light of the swinging sea-lamp I saw every bit of available wall-space hung deep with sea-boots oilskins and garments clean and dirty of various sorts
BTS The days were growing longer
BTS In the meantime the erstwhile cabin-boy had not moved
BTS Then amongst the sticks themselves appeared a live thing twisting and turning of a colour like the colour of the sun in the sky
BTS Blows were raining upon him from all sides
BTS The tables were deserted and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see the outcome of the wager and to lay odds
BTS 3 Harriman with Frick for counsel and Odell as political lieutenant controlling the central continental Southwestern and Southern Pacific Coast lines of transportation
BTS At her solicitation I let her take the watch till midnight it was then nine o'clock but I wrapped her in blankets and put an oilskin about her before I lay down
BTS Their leaders were executed for sedition or confined in madhouses
BTS How did he get away
BTS I blew up the embers we had not yet arranged a winter kitchen and quite feverishly cooked the breakfast
BTS His instinct would not permit him to attack her while her persistence would not permit him to ignore her
BTS Hats and mittens were flying in the air
BTS He agreed with Peter Donnelly that Jackson should have got damages and he went farther and called the action heartless and cold-blooded that had turned the worker adrift after he had been made helpless by the accident
BTS They spread out and struck a northerly course across the ocean
BTS Philosophy is-- Dr
BTS Is it a bit more absurd than what you advocate you machine-breaker returning to the antediluvian ways of your forefathers
BTS Power
BTS The oath left my lips in my excitement the first I do believe in my life unless trouble it an expletive of my youth be accounted an oath
BTS I make up for it in part by doing my own cooking though sometimes I get something to eat in cheap coffee-houses
BTS We loved love and our love was never smirched by anything less than the best
BTS The capture of the world-market by the United States had disrupted the rest of the world
BTS There was no levity in it
BTS They were set apart from the rest of labor
BTS Who's that mug
BTS But won't they escape as Wainwright did
BTS An almost funereal gloom seemed to have descended upon the Ghost
BTS The last growl could never be extracted from him
BTS Wolf Larsen shook his head
BTS One is driving a delivery wagon for us
BTS Out of the ethical incoherency and inconsistency of capitalism the oligarchs emerged with a new ethics coherent and definite sharp and severe as steel the most absurd and unscientific and at the same time the most potent ever possessed by any tyrant class
BTS Then Maud pressed and held the fingers about the pencil with her own hand and the hand wrote in large letters and so slowly that the minutes ticked off to each letter B-O-S-H
BTS behind Grey Beaver were a club and godhead
BTS My wrist was released but his other arm passed around my back held both my arms so that I could not move
BTS Wolf Larsen it was always Wolf Larsen enslaver and tormentor of men a male Circe and these his swine suffering brutes that grovelled before him and revolted only in drunkenness and in secrecy
BTS With the hunters it was otherwise
BTS but fear passed into terror until finally his yelps were voiced in unbroken succession unconnected with the rhythm of the punishment
BTS and on the land I would have been lying on the broad of my back with a surgeon attending on me and with strict injunctions to do nothing but rest
BTS His income last year was about 100000000-- it is doubtful if the incomes of all the Rothschilds together make a greater sum
BTS but all the currents had gone counter to those to which he now abandoned himself
BTS This was sent out all over the country in an Associated Press despatch and from all over the country arose a cry of alarm
BTS He lied he stole he did all sorts of dishonorable things to put bread into my mouth and into the mouths of my brothers and sisters
BTS Having received sundry lessons from Matt said lessons being imparted by means of a club the sled-dogs had learned to leave White Fang alone
BTS I had taken a dislike to him at first and as he helped to dress me this dislike increased
BTS It was my first descent into the forecastle and I shall not soon forget my impression of it caught as I stood on my feet at the bottom of the ladder
BTS and yet through it all was order purpose control
BTS An' there's Smoke the black little devil didn't the Roosians have him for three years in the salt mines of Siberia for poachin' on Copper Island which is a Roosian preserve
BTS Perhaps I suggested
BTS He at once put the Ghost upon her course a course which meant the seal herd and not Yokohama harbour
BTS The tears were running down his puffed and discoloured cheeks and his face was drawn with pain
BTS I tell you yes
BTS But in the meantime there was work to be done
BTS Prometheus
BTS I looked toward the cutter
BTS In a second the whole team was in full cry
BTS They camped early that night
BTS Wolf Larsen was the leopard
BTS He came between him and the shirks he should have punished
BTS But if he is so well-known for what he is I queried how is it that he can get men to ship with him
BTS Will you please dress as warmly as you can at once and make into a bundle whatever you wish to bring with you
BTS But always there is one meal a day and often two
BTS But death in its more sordid and terrible aspects was a thing with which I had been unacquainted till now
BTS Hunting herself for meat up the left fork of the stream where lived the lynx she had followed a day-old trail of One Eye

BTS Jackson was a fool
BTS If you will look at the economic history of the United States you will see that the sum total of capital has continually increased
BTS Because of all this he hated the man
BTS And for your own sake try to avoid witnessing as much as you can the brutalities of the ship
BTS The snow was flying more thickly and White Fang whimpering softly to himself as he stumbled and limped along came upon a fresh trail in the snow
BTS They were all tied to the merciless industrial machine
BTS Straight over Sonoma Mountain we rode
BTS Thus when he had bumped his nose on the back-wall a few times he accepted that he would not disappear into walls
BTS For reply I twisted weakly into a sitting posture and was helped by Yonson to my feet
BTS Forgive me for my rudeness
BTS But as I turned to go I noted that his head had resumed its rocking motion
BTS But now it was different
BTS Again he refused to take it from the hand and again it was tossed to him
BTS well done
BTS There were no other weapons though I thoroughly ransacked the three remaining state-rooms
BTS Wolf Larsen barked a short laugh in my ear and strode away to the weather side of the poop
BTS It dealt in elaborate detail with one factor in the persistence of the established namely the capitalistic bias of the universities and common schools
BTS And the pathos of it and the tragedy is that they are tied by their heartstrings
BTS Number four boat
BTS I could see Maud's solicitude again growing though she timidly and even proudly I think forbore a repetition of her request
BTS He was battling like a giant and I did not guess it
BTS But I was learning I was learning
BTS I knew these men and their mental processes was one of them myself living the seal-hunting life eating the seal-hunting fare thinking largely the seal-hunting thoughts
BTS Van Weyden run aloft again and cut away any stray stuff on your way
BTS Then by observation whenever opportunity offered by study of action speech and the very intonations of the voice he slowly learned the intimacy and the degree of favour they enjoyed with the master
BTS In these unions more favorable conditions will continue to prevail
BTS There must be a full ward waiting for you
BTS And that unconsumed surplus sold abroad becomes what we call our favorable balance of trade
BTS Maud interrupted
BTS It was a very lonely soul I was to learn that never unmasked though at rare moments it played at doing so
BTS In the past he had observed Lip-lip's persecution of White Fang
BTS The two remaining oars were quickly broken
BTS At the same time the Iron Heel helped Mexico and Cuba to put down revolt
BTS To-morrow's papers will merely mention that the Bishop is in poor health that he has been working too hard and that he broke down last night
BTS But what is a hedonist
BTS while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled
BTS '  So cast it in
BTS But now it was different
BTS I really must sit down Maud said with a nervous laugh and a dizzy gesture and forthwith she sat down on the sand
BTS That's a hundred and fifty dollars a month
BTS One look at you'd be enough
BTS Once father took advantage of a lull and asked him to say something
BTS Late at night two years after the Chicago Commune Ernest and I arrived together at the Benton Harbor refuge
BTS The Ghost's stumpy masts were in place her crazy sails bent
BTS And before more than one of the grown dogs White Fang's snarl enabled him to beat an honourable retreat
BTS Still I could not see the expediency of the manoeuvre for the free sea was still intercepted by the Macedonia's five weather boats which in turn had hauled close on the wind
BTS The natives died of starvation by the million while their rulers robbed them of the fruits of their toil and expended it on magnificent pageants and mumbo-jumbo fooleries
BTS But at the same time there was a suspicious crackling movement beside him and his astonished eye saw a young spruce sapling bending down above him to strike him
BTS She announced her condition by a long heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear then sprang straight for Buck
BTS This was evidently Wolf Larsen's quest to find the men who appeared to be asleep and who were not asleep or who had not been asleep very recently
BTS She nozzled him and caressed him and licked the cuts made in him by the weasel's teeth
BTS And that Charles's sister's tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the building of a Yukon fire was apparent only to Mercedes who disburdened herself of copious opinions upon that topic and incidentally upon a few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her husband's family
BTS At first he had known surprise
BTS His important part was played in drafting the new code after the Chicago Commune
BTS They told us we couldn't make White River and here we are
BTS Outraged labor continued to wreak vengeance on the traitors
BTS Surely there can be little in this world more awful than the spectacle of a strong man in the moment when he is utterly weak and broken
BTS Another advantage he possessed was that of correctly judging time and distance
BTS As a result driven back upon themselves from every side the traitors and their families became clannish
BTS Ernest looked at me intently for a moment then went on
BTS Wot 're you good for anyw'y I'd like to know
BTS I know I know Bishop Morehouse interrupted with an agonized expression on his face
BTS I've lost one of my precious hair-pins
BTS Here was no warm side of a tepee against which to snuggle
BTS In those days murder in the first degree was a capital offense
BTS From under clefts among the rocks I gathered a few dry sticks and chips
BTS But Bishop Morehouse turned out to have become interested in Ernest and was anxious for another meeting
BTS Every blow was shrewd to hurt
BTS Day after day the boats lowered and were swallowed up almost ere they touched the water while we on board pumped the horn at regular intervals and every fifteen minutes fired the bomb gun
BTS He could feel the pricking and stinging of the old anger as it strove to rise up in him but it strove against love
BTS And there is no milk for the coffee
BTS two at Ardis and one at Asgard
BTS He was all but naked a ragged and fire-scorched skin hanging part way down his back but on his body there was much hair
BTS But now could I sit still for one half-hour and do nothing not even think it would be the most pleasurable thing in the world
BTS This woman sleeping even now in the spare cabin was a responsibility which I must consider and the only rational thought that flickered through my mind was that I must do nothing hastily if I were to be any help to her at all
BTS Because of all this he became possessed of a great pride in himself which communicated itself like a contagion to his physical being
BTS Even as he spoke a bullet was deflected by a brass-capped spoke of the wheel between his hands and screeched off through the air to windward
BTS How many dogs 've we got Henry
BTS Not in a day nor a generation were the ravaged sheepfolds to be forgotten
BTS And even as he looked the brute deliberately stretched himself after the manner of a lazy dog yawning full in his face and looking upon him with a possessive eye as if in truth he were merely a delayed meal that was soon to be eaten
BTS So as twilight deepened gladly and at the same time reluctantly I brought the Ghost up on the wind
BTS And as I looked the thought came to me that in that rushing stream of human lava were men comrades and heroes whose mission had been to rouse the abysmal beast and to keep the enemy occupied in coping with it
BTS He is up in the air with all kinds of ethical delusions and plans for mission work among the cultured
BTS and out of the courage of fear I evolved the plan of fighting Thomas Mugridge with his own weapons
BTS The hawk would also have eaten him
BTS He was thoroughly beaten by the law and the bare-faced robbery held good
BTS Listen to that we heard a soldier say
BTS My impression of him the first time I saw him had been unfavorable
BTS After that I was not surprised when he tended bar for a week in the saloon across the street
BTS For once Jim Hall was right
BTS so he might as well start in right now
BTS The distinction between being native born and foreign born was sharp and invidious in those days
BTS He came upon one of the man-animals Grey Beaver who was squatting on his hams and doing something with sticks and dry moss spread before him on the ground
BTS Often he took to the rim-ice that was beginning to form and more than once he crashed through and struggled for life in the icy current
BTS Beauty Smith replied with a grunt
BTS Oh it won't be called that
BTS What do they own or through dominant ownership control to-day
BTS Then he would put it on the stone again and whet whet whet till I could have laughed aloud it was so very ludicrous
BTS It was a fateful day for the Yeehats
BTS It paused head up close by a clump of spruce trees and with sight and scent studied the outfit of the watching men
BTS but it was the treatment he received
BTS I sprang toward the rigging to which I might have clung and was met by the descending wall of water
BTS Johnson fought bravely enough but he was no match for Wolf Larsen much less for Wolf Larsen and the mate
BTS I never 'ad none was the Cockney's comment as he gazed with lustreless hopeless eyes into mine
BTS Hello Hump he said
BTS The effect on White Fang was to give him a greater faith in himself and a greater pride
BTS Temptation was the topic they had hit upon and from the few words I heard I made out that he was contending that temptation was temptation only when a man was seduced by it and fell
BTS Time and time again he tried for the snow-white throat where life bubbled near to the surface and each time and every time Spitz slashed him and got away
BTS I know men club them I said trying to reassure myself and gazing doubtfully at a large bull not thirty feet away upreared on his fore-flippers and regarding me intently
BTS And yet love of freedom glowed sombrely and steadily in his dim soul
BTS It would be a mercy to kill him Scott insisted
BTS he asked
BTS Scott I'll make free to say you're seventeen kinds of a damn fool an' all of 'em different an' then some
BTS Tell me why have you always buried yourself in California
BTS I suppose Doctor you live in the mind
BTS Themselves they had covered twelve hundred miles with two days' rest and in the nature of reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing
BTS Thus will the surplus be constantly expended while labor does the work
BTS It was during this period that he might have harkened to the memories of the lair and the stream and run back to the Wild
BTS When I had finished the bed I caught myself looking at him in a fascinated sort of way
BTS The paw with rigid claws curving like talons shot under the tender belly and came back with a swift ripping movement
BTS In acknowledgment of fealty he proceeded to take upon himself the guardianship of his master's property
BTS You have repeatedly confessed to-night by direct avowal or ignorant statement that you do not know the working class
BTS two inches
BTS The Yukon was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down
BTS and I caught a glimpse of a man standing at the wheel and of another man who seemed to be doing little else than smoke a cigar
BTS No it was not easy
BTS Eh Kerfoot
BTS What is it all about
BTS He did not like it
BTS It knew no body
BTS Following the housewarming which was accomplished by means of seal-oil and a wick made from cotton calking came the hunting for our winter's meat and the building of the second hut
BTS while he alone in this particular took after his father
BTS God must be angry
BTS The old awe departed and they grew equal to challenging his authority
BTS That mast goes in to-day
BTS I asked
BTS They are strong hands
BTS My first thought was that it had served Jackson right for getting such a lawyer
BTS When I arose at seven I saw no sign of Maud and concluded she was in the galley preparing breakfast
BTS Then what he expected began
BTS Go on go on I pray you
BTS So he learnt to give no warning of his intention
BTS A standing army of professional soldiers was created officered by members of the Oligarchy and known as the Mercenaries
BTS why he comes a-buttin' round the Godforsaken ends of the earth that's what I can't exactly see
BTS but for the great majority of the religious heaven and hell are incidental to right and wrong
BTS But a still greater cunning lurked in the recesses of the Indian mind
BTS One thing in this connection White Fang quickly learnt and that was that a thieving god was usually a cowardly god and prone to run away at the sounding of the alarm
BTS Eh
BTS Home
BTS Of course you will do that
BTS And I shall protest
BTS Their persecutors were sentenced to long terms in prison where they were harshly treated
BTS And to cap it all that cap
BTS Of course the crew gave me the go-by
BTS I was invited father announced
BTS Wickson went on coldly and dispassionately
BTS For the time fear had been routed by growth while growth had assumed the guise of curiosity
BTS Whet whet whet it went all day long
BTS But the other kind was divided
BTS It struck against the wall and his body seemed to express a muscular and physical relief at the contact as though he had found his bearings his location in space as well as something against which to lean
BTS He no longer was afraid of anything
BTS There were swift commands on deck a stamping of feet and a slapping of reef-points as the Ghost shot into the wind and about on the other tack
BTS Come back to earth
BTS The Bishop obeyed Christ's injunction and got locked up in a madhouse
BTS As the days went by Smoke's prophecy was verified
BTS That day they made forty miles the trail being packed
BTS I beg of you not to receive false impressions of us from Mr
BTS In the north he had learned the lesson that he must let the master's dogs alone and he did not forget that lesson now
BTS I have been in the thick of life so long that I am oppressed by the peace and quiet and I cannot forbear from dwelling upon that mad maelstrom of death and destruction so soon to burst forth
BTS It had snowed during the night and he was completely buried
BTS It was the one infallible token that I had not failed
BTS And then it happened
BTS This was maddening to them
BTS Henderson seems the best of the hunters a slow-going fellow and hard to rouse
BTS Thus White Fang was kept in training
BTS You can never cure a chicken-killer
BTS Contrary to our expectation no obstacles were raised to prevent the socialist Congressmen from taking their seats
BTS Also another patrol machine had halted
BTS Oh not that I'm afraid of you not that I'm afraid of you he hastened to add
BTS It was the last days they claimed the beginning of the end of the world
BTS Oh yes he acknowledged
BTS I remembered Ernest's women of Chicago who toiled for ninety cents a week and the child slaves of the Southern cotton mills he had described
BTS he finally exploded and went back to his task
BTS But the memory of his mother held him
BTS It could not be--not in those faded overalls too long in the legs and frayed at the bottoms
BTS Nilson was as cheerful as could be expected for his broken leg was knitting nicely
BTS Sure the dog-musher answered
BTS I returned to my hut for the shot-gun made sure it was loaded and went down to the Ghost
BTS he cried but Buck refused to budge
BTS Without warning without trace men and women and even children disappeared and were seen no more their end shrouded in mystery
BTS In all his life he's only been known once to go off his feet and here he's been rolled twice in thirty seconds
BTS How d'ye find me aboard if 'twasn't that I was drunk as a pig when I put me name down
BTS He had driven his teeth into the sacred flesh of one of them and could expect nothing but a most terrible punishment
BTS I could have cried with joy as I noted Ernest's increasing uneasiness and impatience
BTS Then Buck took to rushing as though for the throat when suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of Spitz as a ram by which to overthrow him
BTS I was only Humphrey Van Weyden a bookish fellow who loved
BTS Another lesson
BTS The dog was unable to gnaw through the leather at his own end of the stick
BTS And not I alone
BTS There was no defence for him
BTS and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle
BTS The law was being lived about him by all live things and he himself was part and parcel of the law
BTS You'd better run up and loosen the topsails
BTS The truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
BTS He smiled at my recital
BTS The soldier was clumsy
BTS I persisted
BTS D'ye know Hump he said with a slow seriousness which had in it an indefinable strain of sadness that this is the first time I have heard the word ethics' in the mouth of a man
BTS Who
BTS The pain of the beating was dull and distant just as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and distant
BTS I queried
BTS But Wolf Larsen ignored that worthy turning at once to the cabin-boy
BTS It was a simple matter to give the dogs less food
BTS He sprang at the foremost man it was the chief of the Yeehats ripping the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood
BTS No dog could make him lose his footing
BTS After a few minutes by the time the white men had got over their surprise the gang scattered
BTS The old man wants you
BTS Here were no seals whatever
BTS Surely there must be a hell for in no less place could it be possible for you to receive punishment adequate to your crimes
BTS But outside the realm of business these men are stupid
BTS The blood of little children and of strong men is dripping from your very roof-beams
BTS He lost his arm in the Sierra Mills and like a broken-down horse you turned him out on the highway to die
BTS A soft southland dog would have died under it but not he
BTS Our own whistle was blowing hoarsely and from time to time the sound of other whistles came to us from out of the fog
BTS I came back and went on with my work
BTS As I say I debated with myself and then I did what I consider the bravest act of my life
BTS You've merely got a foretaste of the Iron Heel
BTS In his random reading he had never chanced upon the Rubaiyat and it was to him like a great find of treasure
BTS ' I asked
BTS at all
BTS Several days went by the Ghost still foaming down the trades and I could swear I saw madness growing in Thomas Mugridge's eyes
BTS It is well known that he toiled hard for liberty and suffered sore
BTS To make sure I returned and went through the steerage and forecastle and in the galley gathered up all the sharp meat and vegetable knives
BTS Stick a knife in him and let his spirit free
BTS And I'll show you the emptiness of it
BTS Armies of troops were put into the field and the fanatics were herded back at the bayonet point to their tasks in the cities
BTS And I am very happy--indeed most happy
BTS It is the law
BTS Yes sir the cook eagerly interpolated with appeasing and apologetic servility
BTS I nodded my head and she having recovered herself waited expectantly
BTS Oh he'll heave to in a little while and pick them up I answered cheerfully
BTS The Church does not condone it the Bishop objected
BTS Yes yes I know and that man my brother more sentiment
BTS If I need your assistance I'll call you in
BTS There was a ring of triumph in his voice and his eyes clear blue this morning as the sea were sparkling with light
BTS It was like a message from the night of the grave
BTS Yet the other dogs because they weighed less and were born to the life received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition
BTS There is a greater strength than wealth and it is greater because it cannot be taken away
BTS Then he perceived that they were very little and he became bolder
BTS Then the boat emerged half swamped Leach flinging the water out and Johnson clinging to the steering-oar his face white and anxious
BTS A brisk wind was blowing into the cove and though the water was calm rapid work was required to get us safely out
BTS The only values he recognized were mathematical and scientific facts
BTS While the revolutionists were wiped out the loss was not one-sided
BTS This lasted several minutes and White Fang was beginning to enjoy it as a sort of game
BTS But the next instant she was warning him away from the cubs with a snarl that was less harsh than usual and that was more apologetic than menacing
BTS He favoured me with a contemptuous stare
BTS We ate dinner a hurried and anxious meal for me with eighteen men abroad on the sea and beyond the bulge of the earth and with that heaven-rolling mountain range of clouds moving slowly down upon us
BTS They had not discovered simplicity of living
BTS While Baseek had been growing weaker with age White Fang had been growing stronger with youth
BTS Is it not true that a machine-loom will weave more cloth and weave more cheaply than a hand-loom
BTS I am only a weak woman but just my small assistance may enable you to escape disaster
BTS The summer camp was being dismantled and the tribe bag and baggage was preparing to go off to the fall hunting
BTS Twilight drew down and night came on and White Fang lay by his mother's side
BTS Who was he
BTS nor could it express itself in terms of itself
BTS We in turn had countered this move
BTS It was evident nothing had happened yet
BTS Was your branch store the cause of it
BTS That is why the workingmen will have nothing to do with the Church
BTS Calvin promptly replied
BTS Wasn't I a-layin' on the Emma L
BTS Nor did I for an instant take my eyes off him
BTS Once a full-grown female lynx was secured and this time White Fang fought for his life
BTS Neither of us spoke
BTS The water-breakers and grub-boxes from all the other boats were likewise missing as were the beds and sea bags of the two men
BTS We left the old town of Sonoma to the right and rode up a canyon that lay between outlying buttresses of the mountain
BTS But the Iron Heel can't maintain so costly a programme forever I objected
BTS There he sat gentle and stolid and somnolent
BTS Life when it knows that it must cease living will always rebel
BTS We were farther from Japan than the night we left the Ghost
BTS Furthermore there was no dog like him on the Mackenzie nor the Yukon
BTS He smiled when I asked him the reason the newspapers suppressed all mention of Jackson or his case
BTS Why nothing else than put the masts back into the Ghost and sail away
BTS Then he slowly sank down and the soldiers reached him
BTS There she blows
BTS And still you struggle in my grip
BTS He speedily learned that Perrault and Francois were fair men calm and impartial in administering justice and too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs
BTS They were society women
BTS Thus Du Bois and Woods were held in Porto Rico while Everhard and Merryweather were placed in Alcatraz an island in San Francisco Bay that had already seen long service as a military prison
BTS When I say 'you' I mean the superintendent and the officials that you and the other stockholders pay to manage the mills for you
BTS He had an encyclopaedic command of the field of knowledge and by a word or a phrase by delicate rapier thrusts he punctured them
BTS Therefore capital does not consume its share
BTS He did not know what they said but he could see the man and Grey Beaver talking together
BTS Life was flowing through him again splendid and indomitable
BTS I had hoped to send them away to the country if I'd won Jackson's case
BTS Wolf Larsen had returned to the poop and we stood in a silent group watching the lights rapidly cross our bow
BTS He crouched down under the impending blow his hair bristling but his teeth still keeping tight hold of the rabbit
BTS That I should take a knife or a gun or an axe and kill this man
BTS Then what is it worth to you
BTS 'Tis the beast he is this Wolf Larsen the great big beast mentioned iv in Revelation
BTS Long-distance funerals is somethin' you an' me can't exactly afford
BTS This ridiculous picture well illustrates the heartless conduct of the masters
BTS Of course there is the large likelihood that the proletariat will take it away first
BTS A more scrawny pitiful specimen of humanity one could hardly conceive
BTS Injunctions were served on him
BTS With help on the inside this was not difficult for in that shadow-world of secret service identity was nebulous
BTS The boy hesitated then mastered his temper
BTS The jaw the chin the brow rising to a goodly height and swelling heavily above the eyes these while strong in themselves unusually strong seemed to speak an immense vigour or virility of spirit that lay behind and beyond and out of sight
BTS The occasional blows of sticks and stones he had previously experienced were as caresses compared with this
BTS No more than the proletariat
BTS He even robbed Grey Beaver's snare of a rabbit at a time when Grey Beaver staggered and tottered through the forest sitting down often to rest what of weakness and of shortness of breath
BTS Eh
BTS The circle of flame and coals was breaking into segments with openings in between
BTS Had Lip-lip not existed he would have passed his puppyhood with the other puppies and grown up more doglike and with more liking for dogs
BTS The old system of labor was broken down
BTS But no matter how Spitz circled Joe whirled around on his heels to face him mane bristling ears laid back lips writhing and snarling jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap and eyes diabolically gleaming the incarnation of belligerent fear
BTS A surgeon came in to dress the wounded soldier and I learned that it was two in the afternoon
BTS Then he applied his teeth to the thong and in the space of ten seconds was free
BTS And so well did he face it that at the end of half an hour the wolves drew back discomfited
BTS He was brilliant but so was Maud and for some time I lost the thread of the conversation through studying her face as she talked
BTS Don't I remember him in Hakodate two years gone when he had a row an' shot four iv his men
BTS Never mind expense
BTS I shook my head
BTS There was a query in her voice and she faced me accusingly as though I were guilty of the deed or at least a party to it
BTS Quite the opposite
BTS A Blessed Wolf amended the Judge's wife
BTS and when in the moment of his indecision Collie nipped him and scampered off he turned and followed after
BTS One day the Bishop disappeared
BTS He was no longer to be disregarded and ignored as was the lot of puppies and as continued to be the lot of the puppies that were his team-mates
BTS Late that afternoon we hove up anchor and got away
BTS Nothin' sir
BTS he exclaimed the next moment
BTS I'm thinking you're down in the mouth some Henry said
BTS This was Francois's speech next morning when he discovered Spitz missing and Buck covered with wounds
BTS And on the morrow I awoke to find in myself a longing to see him again
BTS The railroad station at Independence was blown up by the agents of the capitalists
BTS And ships must visit the station
BTS and he resolved to investigate after he had finished the business in hand
BTS The wolf whirled about pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of Joe and of all cornered husky dogs snarling and bristling clipping his teeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps
BTS Matt stood staring along the sights at the empty space of snow which had been occupied by White Fang
BTS Scott who had been patting White Fang suddenly bent closer and pointed out fresh-made cuts on his muzzle and a gash between the eyes
BTS I beg your pardon Miss Brewster or should I say Mrs
BTS To save his son he betrayed his comrades
BTS I'm coming
BTS But here was a dog that kept at a distance dancing and dodging here and there and all about
BTS Darkness was coming on and for a while he played about among the trees pleasuring in his freedom
BTS Don't you see
BTS Also he learned that but brief time elapsed between his sounding of the alarm and Grey Beaver coming to his aid
BTS And on the part of White Fang it required nothing less than a revolution
BTS Least of all things was I a mechanic and in that time I accomplished what an ordinary machinist would have done in as many hours
BTS He could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face
BTS It had come at last love had come when I least expected it and under the most forbidding conditions
BTS but whatever it was it affected the hunters strongly for the cheering was followed by loud exclamations and shouts of joy
BTS But what shall we do
BTS One of the pleasant and axiomatic fictions they have created is that they are superior to the rest of mankind in wisdom and efficiency
BTS I was looking through the glasses and I saw the oar-blade shatter as he shot
BTS How I went over I do not know though I did know and instantly why those in the water were so desirous of getting back on the steamer
BTS d'ye want yer nose punched
BTS labor succeeded in getting a law passed in Pennsylvania providing that proof of the age of the child and of certain educational qualifications must accompany the oath of the parent
BTS Each fall when the Yeehats follow the movement of the moose there is a certain valley which they never enter
BTS Pervaise was mastered by the fear of death all of which is recounted at length in his confession
BTS And if it storms
BTS Kowalt cried
BTS We haven't the least idea
BTS but this time I shouted in merriment as I danced about the beach bareheaded in mock despair
BTS This was the man-animal's justice
BTS I put three or four spokes over to counteract a sheer toward the wind on the part of the Ghost and then steadied her
BTS And then just then the faintest possible whisper of air passed by
BTS and when the breeze stirred them into huge movements he cowered down in fear keeping his eyes warily upon them and prepared to spring away if they attempted to precipitate themselves upon him
BTS His father Elmo a huge St
BTS You're a preacher aren't you
BTS Her instinctive fear of the father of her progeny was toning down
BTS I crept back to my horse blankets and slept again
BTS That was the last play of the Wolf he said
BTS But that leap was never made
BTS One Eye sprang back with a snort of sudden fright then shrank down to the snow and crouched snarling threats at this thing of fear he did not understand
BTS But this was no more than temporary
BTS Understand
BTS Yet the thought of Aristotle ruled Europe for twelve centuries Dr
BTS Morning found him too weak to travel
BTS You know how to serve corporations and increase dividends by twisting the law
BTS But he braced himself to the shock of Spitz's charge then joined the flight out on the lake
BTS During that period I used to marvel at my own metamorphosis
BTS The swiftness of it was bewildering
BTS Joe came next yelping with pain
BTS She should sleep
BTS At this moment still running at top speed White Fang became suddenly aware of an attack from the side
BTS I shouldn't mind if they cut my flesh with stripes or burned me at the stake or crucified me head--downward
BTS He was lying motionless but moved slightly at the touch of my hand
BTS and there were times when a single dog scored deeply on him
BTS These limitations and restraints were laws
BTS Perrault grinned
BTS Romaines one of the tools in this affair like Pervaise was lying in jail in another state Kansas awaiting trial when he was approached by the agents of the capitalists
BTS I worked feverishly
BTS but to them in turn it had been passed down through all the generations of wolves that had gone before
BTS Three days I worked on that windlass
BTS Hammerfield sneered
BTS They were swayed by the same ethic that dominated their husbands--the ethic of their class
BTS The divergence of opinion on the parts of Mary McKenna and the Bishop do menace society
BTS He began to sleep out at night staying away from camp for days at a time
BTS After a searching scrutiny the animal trotted forward a few steps
BTS Sometimes and rarely he managed to get his feet to the earth and for a moment to brace himself against White Fang
BTS She shook her head with mock ruefulness
BTS The winds baffled and we drifted aimlessly the greater part of the night
BTS It is true she worked hard but I cannot understand
BTS No
BTS There was no change in him
BTS In this manner had fought forgotten ancestors
BTS The wind drove them back and not only over me but over Henderson and Wolf Larsen
BTS What of his joy the great love in him ever surging and struggling to express itself succeeded in finding a new mode of expression
BTS I could row no more
BTS No I haven't I retorted
BTS ' The average man IS selfish the Bishop affirmed valiantly
BTS And struggle on Johnson did
BTS when he could no longer pull he fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to his feet again
BTS The Bishop was silent
BTS Intellectually they had bored him
BTS Look at him now
BTS Goo' night everybody
BTS Every street was a canyon every building a mountain
BTS Then my knees gave from under me and I sank down myself again but overcome by shock at knowledge of what I had so nearly done
BTS I saw his face grow hard and the merciless glitter come into his eyes
BTS But this was accomplished only through my merging my life completely into his
BTS he was doing that for which he was made killing meat and battling to kill it
BTS He tried to sniff noses with her but she retreated playfully and coyly
BTS Ernest smilingly acquiesced
BTS The master's wife called him the Blessed Wolf which name was taken up with acclaim and all the women called him the Blessed Wolf
BTS Louis looked at me shrewdly
BTS for if all labor and all capital shared profits the same conditions would obtain as did obtain when there was no profit-sharing
BTS They could not advance over that wave of dead and the idea was to run them down the cross street
BTS Perhaps the situation was not hopeless
BTS In loud voices they shouted over the day's fighting wrangled about details or waxed affectionate and made friends with the men whom they had fought
BTS The Corsican knew
BTS Not content with this he fetched a second chest and placed it on top of the first
BTS It is to be regretted that she did not live to complete her narrative for then undoubtedly would have been cleared away the mystery that has shrouded for seven centuries the execution of Ernest Everhard
BTS He told it inimitably but it was the story of a failure
BTS It was stupid of me I know
BTS You cannot but grant that the ownership of wealth constitutes essential power in the United States to-day
BTS Then there were meals to be cooked in the galley beds to make Wolf Larsen to be attended upon and she finished the day with a grand house-cleaning attack upon the cabin and steerage
BTS There was no telling what the outcome would have been for the third wolf joined the elder and together old leader and young leader they attacked the ambitious three-year-old and proceeded to destroy him
BTS This was greeted with whoops of joy and from then on Wolf Larsen had seven strong men on top of him Louis I believe taking no part in it
BTS Every man to his trade
BTS Here lend me a hand before you pull your freight he added
BTS Philip Ward the equally great philanthropist
BTS The master rode alone that day
BTS His eyes were blazing his mouth was wide open
BTS His reasoning was justified for the boat rushed at once into the wind and the hunter sprang aft to take the boat-steerer's place
BTS As rigid as the sled-discipline of the gods was the discipline maintained by White Fang amongst his fellows
BTS At any rate we are safe now
BTS White Fang watched the performance with increasing anxiety until he could contain himself no longer when he sprang in front of the horse and barked savagely and warningly
BTS Even they were frightened not at the boy's terrible words but at his terrible audacity
BTS The strange god's foot lifted
BTS Her face brightened
BTS You may be wrong but whether you are wrong or right I shall stand by my guns
BTS And for the first time since the stabbing the Cockney had appeared outside the galley without his knife
BTS I could have thought him the old Wolf Larsen and yet there was in his movements a vague suggestion of weakness and indecision
BTS But this time before he dozed again he tied a burning pine-knot to his right hand
BTS But especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest reading signs and sounds as man may read a book and seeking for the mysterious something that called called waking or sleeping at all times for him to come
BTS The fin disappeared
BTS And in the business of love the three-year-old who had made this his first adventure upon it yielded up his life
BTS To live
BTS and they believed it firmly believed it
BTS but I could have sworn there was a note of disappointment in her voice
BTS Of the other two Bertha Stole disappeared twelve years later while Anna Roylston still lives and plays an increasingly important part in the Revolution
BTS and he did not even murmur or change the expression on his face
BTS By oligarchs and comrades on the inside who were high in authority place had been made for us we were in possession of all necessary documents and our pasts were accounted for
BTS A return of apprehension was apparent when at the top of the companion-way Wolf Larsen invited him below
BTS Membership in these unions will become like seats in Paradise
BTS He bristled fiercely and looked ominously across the shin-bone at White Fang
BTS I never heard his other name
BTS Take my advice and accept the vacation
BTS What was of value to the master he valued
BTS If you can come you will see the cave-man in evening dress snarling and snapping over a bone
BTS There were great stables where a dozen grooms and boys held forth rows of vine-clad servants' cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses long grape arbors green pastures orchards and berry patches
BTS her canvas loomed darkly in the night
BTS I had been caught up in a monstrous flood that was sweeping me I knew not whither
BTS There was nothing stirring amidships
BTS The breath was leaving his lungs and his chest was collapsing under my weight
BTS I made no haste to return on deck and when I did I was gratified to see Miss Brewster in animated conversation with Wolf Larsen
BTS But it lost time that night
BTS Couldn't see
BTS Soldiers and slaves lay together torn and mangled around and over the wreckage of the automobiles and guns
BTS Will you trust yourself to me for a journey of six hundred miles or so
BTS It was idle he knew to get between a fool and his folly
BTS and as I paced the deck hour after hour I found myself afflicted with Wolf Larsen's repulsive ideas
BTS written by one Ambrose Bierce an avowed and confirmed misanthrope of the period Grapeshot n
BTS He did not know what love was
BTS McCready and Swanson sir the boy corrected his eyes burning with a bitter light
BTS So to him the entrance of the cave was a wall a wall of light
BTS How long does it take you
BTS Why do you know that your father has three times as many chances for safety of life and limb than has a working-man
BTS The fact man the irrefragable fact
BTS Just wait till he gets a glimpse iv yer mugs to-morrow the gang iv ye he chuckled
BTS Look at him now
BTS CHAPTER XXIII Brave winds blowing fair swiftly drove the Ghost northward into the seal herd
BTS I saw him pulled aft to the cabin and noted with a shock of surprise that the galley had disappeared
BTS The other glared at him in sudden wrath
BTS Dumb apathy had vanished
BTS Am I right
BTS He waited
BTS So he rendered fealty in the new way by running with the master's horse
BTS I asked
BTS but with a turn of the sheet and the application of my whole strength each time it slapped I slowly backed it
BTS Bah
BTS I beg your pardon he said the next moment
BTS Watch out next for the suppression of the socialist press and socialist publishing houses
BTS I questioned
BTS Piece by piece he ate all the meat and nothing happened
BTS This was too much for White Fang
BTS No I said not yet
BTS And why do you think I have made this thing
BTS This life only you are certain is real
BTS As we waited on the platform three trains thundered past bound west to Chicago
BTS I proceeded to experiment lashing and wedging the steering-oar until the boat held on fairly well by the wind without my assistance
BTS Hitherto they had been denied access to the fire and they now settled down in a close-drawn circle like so many dogs blinking and yawning and stretching their lean bodies in the unaccustomed warmth
BTS The dog's a mint
BTS On the contrary he seemed kindly disposed toward her too kindly to suit her for he was prone to run near to her and when he ran too near it was she who snarled and showed her teeth
BTS That and the troop-trains have made us late
BTS The white fangs
BTS But there was little time for laughter in those days what of our heavy work and of the awfulness of Wolf Larsen's living death
BTS the man shouted
BTS Then on the Ghost I had learned to be responsible for myself
BTS And damned glad you were to let them have it
BTS She sprang away yelling with pain and while he took delight in the smell of burning flesh and hair he watched her shaking her head and growling wrathfully a score of feet away
BTS Maud who had prepared me for disappointment and who had been sprightly and vivacious all day broke down as we landed in our own little cove
BTS Bill threw on more wood before lighting his pipe
BTS Hands were things to keep away from
BTS She gave no sign that she had heard though the expression of her eyes changed to one of inexpressible loathing as she started to turn away
BTS Thomas Mugridge was beside himself a blithering imbecile so pleased was he at chumming thus with the captain
BTS They all'll be here in the mornin' hunkydory
BTS He sprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them both and Spitz particularly for his whole experience with Buck had gone to teach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog who managed to hold his own only because of his great weight and size
BTS Buck to whom fair play was a forgotten code likewise sprang upon Spitz
BTS But the god went on talking
BTS Look at the intelligence of him Scott went on hastily
BTS I thought so he muttered
BTS As the days went by other dogs came in crates and at the ends of ropes some docilely and some raging and roaring as he had come
BTS God knows I don't want to kill him or have him killed Scott answered putting away the revolver
BTS I therefore say to the rich among you that it is their duty to do what I have done and am doing
BTS Tell him the deck flopped up and gouged yer teeth out iv yer jaw Louis grinned
BTS The struggle with Japan and the rest of Asia for India was merely delayed
BTS She must have received warning of the coming of the Mercenaries for she had time safely to hide the Manuscript before she fled or was captured
BTS Buck was inexorable
BTS He might roll a dog off its feet but the pack would be upon him before he could follow up and deliver the deadly throat-stroke
BTS Matt regarded his employer with grieved disapproval
BTS And don't forget that it is the press the pulpit and the university that mould public opinion set the thought-pace of the nation
BTS He looked at me in a slow and pondering way and shook his head
BTS and one after the other they drew back streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders
BTS What's its bearings
BTS They've got us beaten that way to a frazzle
BTS And the Ghost is lying as you can see for yourself bow on to the beach
BTS Friend and foe are all mixed up
BTS I said
BTS I know I know she waived my protest
BTS He did not know White Fang's breed so for weapon he took a light buggy-whip
BTS His instructions were too clear for me to make a mistake
BTS Each man felt that he had been robbed
BTS The toothed drum of the picker caught his arm
BTS Then the flood seemed suddenly to subside and I was breathing the good air again
BTS I've had more cruel sufferin' than any ten men I 'ave
BTS What I saw I could not at first believe
BTS It was too terrible and awful to be true
BTS and he came because men had found a yellow metal in the North and because Manuel was a gardener's helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers small copies of himself
BTS Once and unwitting that he did so or that I saw he laughed aloud mockingly and defiantly at the advancing storm
BTS The dying man beat a tattoo on the hatch with his heels straightened out his legs and stiffened in one great tense effort and rolled his head from side to side
BTS Inside the Mercenaries were thousands of our comrades
BTS The gods were all-wise and there was no telling what masterful treachery lurked behind that apparently harmless piece of meat
BTS This idea had been earlier advanced but not demonstrated by Sir Oliver Lodge and other students in the new field of radio-activity
BTS He was still a sick man and I more than once observed him creeping painfully aloft to a topsail or drooping wearily as he stood at the wheel
BTS Three hundred and a present at that was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater
BTS Though he could not drown and was nine-lived in addition he was suffering all the agonies of half-drowning
BTS I have no fictions that make for nobility and manhood
BTS But endure it he must or perish and the life that was in him had no desire to perish out
BTS And if you make a mess of it it will be the last you ever make
BTS I can never get them clean again she wailed nor soften the weather-beat
BTS You cannot make the tide of evolution flow backward
BTS She was looking at the man and for some time he returned her look
BTS An oath from Perrault the resounding impact of a club upon a bony frame and a shrill yelp of pain heralded the breaking forth of pandemonium
BTS The callousness of these men to whom industrial organization gave control of the lives of other men was appalling
BTS Sol-leks was limping and Dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder-blade
BTS I waved my arm from the forecastle head and dropped down to the deck
BTS It was my turn to be cheerful and I played the part to the best of my ability and with such success that I brought the laughter back into her dear eyes and song on her lips
BTS As before I had seen him transfigured so now he stood transfigured before me
BTS I'm busy with Hump and you'll do the best you can without him
BTS My
BTS Maud asked
BTS The potatoes he murmured faintly
BTS Buck stood it keeping his mates up to their work and maintaining discipline though he too was very tired
BTS I asked
BTS I could not see the fortress but those on the roof with me said he was directly over it
BTS He missed the snow without being aware of it
BTS Why did you ask
BTS He cowered down and snarled
BTS Six
BTS The walls and towers and shafts of that fair city will arise to the sound of singing and into its beauty and wonder will be woven not sighs and groans but music and laughter
BTS The she-wolf was less than a yard from him
BTS Far away in the south-west I could see a dark line on the water which grew even as I looked at it
BTS He never had enough and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs
BTS Gad sir
BTS Table and bunk were littered with designs and calculations
BTS One was real the other was a dream but which was which
BTS But even this he was not allowed to complete
BTS His human fictions as you choose to call them make for nobility and manhood
BTS What happened after this we can only surmise
BTS What if we crush the bear
BTS There was for me no strangeness to it to the rough clothes the coarse faces the wild laughter and the lurching cabin walls and swaying sea-lamps
BTS Only two blocks he said
BTS One careless sniff had satisfied his mate and she trotted on to reassure him
BTS According to its capitalist system of industry it has an unconsumed surplus that must be got rid of and that must be got rid of abroad
BTS I saw her eyes flash with indignation and this time it was I who dropped mine while I felt my face flushing under her gaze
BTS And I'm going to confound you with them right now
BTS It carn't come right
BTS All things happened abruptly on that day and with an abruptness that was sickening the mob checked itself
BTS What's your name boy
BTS Francois fastened upon him an arrangement of straps and buckles
BTS she cried
BTS I may be executed or assassinated but I shall never be crucified
BTS The rotten bark gave way under his feet and with a despairing yelp he pitched down the rounded crescent smashed through the leafage and stalks of a small bush and in the heart of the bush on the ground fetched up in the midst of seven ptarmigan chicks
BTS There was something ominous about it and in intangible ways one was made to feel that the worst was about to come
BTS As the evening wore on we learned more of his doings
BTS And this also was a law of the gods
BTS It is interesting to note the virilities of language that were common speech in that day as indicative of the life 'red of claw and fang' that was then lived
BTS A living dog is better than a dead lion say I with the Preacher
BTS Here goes I said stepping out
BTS Also a low growl rumbled in his throat as warning that he was not to be trifled with
BTS There came a day when Billee the good-natured fell and could not rise
BTS The thong was cut across diagonally almost as clean as though done by a knife
BTS He achieved an internal as well as external economy
BTS White Fang will have to learn many things and it's just as well that he begins now
BTS Truly she was my woman my mate-woman fighting with me and for me as the mate of a caveman would have fought all the primitive in her aroused forgetful of her culture hard under the softening civilization of the only life she had ever known
BTS Each word was a blasphemy and there were many words
BTS But we must be quick most quick and sure
BTS One thing I was beginning to feel and that was that I could never again be quite the same man I had been
BTS also a typewriter
BTS Not mineself either
BTS I'm going to take your dog from you and I'm going to give you a hundred and fifty for him
BTS Haasfurther has charge now of our prescription department was the answer
BTS I am a sick man
BTS but it had taken upon itself a remarkable remoteness
BTS As the fall of the year came on the moose appeared in greater abundance moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less rigorous valleys
BTS The man who travelled loud-stepping the direct line to the cabin door he let alone though he watched him vigilantly until the door opened and he received the endorsement of the master
BTS Simply by subsidizing the great unions
BTS And hand in hand with this Ernest and the other leaders were hard at work reorganizing the forces of the Revolution
BTS Francois cried slapping his thighs gleefully
BTS All his days White Fang had foraged among the live things for food
BTS Again instructing Maud to slack away at the windlass when I gave the word I proceeded to heave on the watch-tackle
BTS And then we came to the great hole
BTS I'm agreein' with you the dog-musher answered and Weedon Scott was not quite sure whether or not the other had snickered
BTS And when I do you must do your first work on the windlass
BTS then they fell but not swiftly enough to veil the rush of terror that filled them
BTS The lanyards had been almost severed with just enough left to hold the shrouds till some severe strain should be put upon them
BTS They did not know how to do anything and as the days went by it became apparent that they could not learn
BTS When the gods administered punishment they stood on their legs
BTS And then Jim Hall disappeared
BTS He had reached the limit of profitable investment of profits in the oil industry
BTS The present with all its perils and anxieties rushed upon me with stunning force
BTS I held on to the weather rail close by the shrouds and gazed out across the desolate foaming waves to the low-lying fog-banks that hid San Francisco and the California coast
BTS He had a way of taking Buck's head roughly between his hands and resting his own head upon Buck's of shaking him back and forth the while calling him ill names that to Buck were love names
BTS It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life
BTS When they threatened he cowered down
BTS Everhard has flatly stated it
BTS The unrest spread
BTS His was the perfect poise the supreme confidence in self which nothing could shake
BTS He could see them beyond Spitz and to either side half crouching for the spring their eyes fixed upon him
BTS But though known to sailors I invented it there on Endeavour Island
BTS The right to buy and sell is clearly stated
BTS The traders of Europe had to find another route
BTS But White Fang did it trotting away from the fort in the early morning with the end of the stick hanging to his neck
BTS Its members were the wealthiest in the community and the strongest-minded of the wealthy with of course a sprinkling of scholars to give it intellectual tone
BTS And the trusts themselves destroyed competition
BTS There is no balance in their lives
BTS Where are the mothers of these twenty and odd men on the Ghost
BTS Again he struck
BTS And the whole table was aroused shaken alive from monotony and drowsiness
BTS It was our duty to sail the Ghost well to leeward of the last lee boat so that all the boats should have fair wind to run for us in case of squalls or threatening weather
BTS He swept me off my feet by the splendid invincible rush of him
BTS One only he saw a sleek gray fellow flattened against a gray dead limb so that he seemed a part of it a woody excrescence upon the wood itself
BTS He forgot all about the unknown
BTS They quickened the old life within him and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks
BTS But Wolf Larsen was the man-type the masculine and almost a god in his perfectness
BTS it comes to the soldier war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter
BTS And she answered There is no need though the telling of it would be sweet so sweet
BTS The leg-bar is not always worn graciously
BTS The driver was perplexed
BTS Doesn't the Standard Oil Trust own a score of the ocean lines
BTS Still White Fang suspected
BTS But she laughed weakly and her head drooped again
BTS And we're not dreaming now
BTS And once and once only I saw an arm that moved in that dead stream
BTS Henry leaped out of the blankets and to the dogs
BTS If he has destroyed the shears I shall do nothing except begin over again
BTS And he could hear the crashing of their bodies through the undergrowth and the noises they made in the night
BTS He seems to have been badly treated I confessed
BTS The animal waddled toward the centre of the circle short and squat and ungainly
BTS The rest of the pack was now up and surging upon him and a throwing of firebrands right and left was necessary to drive them back to a respectful distance
BTS The master himself was looking on and did not interfere
BTS He is quite reasonable and fair in his calm moments and as he is calm now he will not deny that only yesterday he threatened my life
BTS They never did it again
BTS What good is it
BTS Why is it that you have not done great things in this world
BTS Their feet fell heavily on the trail jarring their bodies and doubling the fatigue of a day's travel
BTS But I must do these men justice
BTS I did not know the Bishop murmured faintly
BTS But Spitz cold and calculating even in his supreme moods left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around
BTS We mined the organization of the Iron Heel with our secret agents and the Iron Heel countermined with its secret agents inside its own organization
BTS There must be some way she contended
BTS But after all wealth in itself is not the real power
BTS Calvin who had once been a great dairy-owner
BTS She nodded her head determinedly
BTS He is a pure exalted soul but he is so unpractical
BTS At the same time there broke upon our ears a continuous and mighty bellowing
BTS Spanker's gone Henry answered
BTS Not that he is much to speak of now Wolf Larsen went on but he has improved wonderfully
BTS After the strike on the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1877 he broached a scheme to have the Locomotive Engineers make terms with the railroads and to go it alone so far as the rest of the labor unions were concerned
BTS He was not conscious of them
BTS It's no use Mr
BTS When they walked he got out of their way
BTS The result was a sharp peck on the end of his nose that made him cower down and ki-yi
BTS I really believe that a finely-organized high-strung man would suffer twice and thrice as much as they from a like injury
BTS We expected the beach to lift up this way and that and the rocky walls to swing back and forth like the sides of a ship
BTS And this strange vessel with its terrible men pressed under by wind and sea and ever leaping up and out was heading away into the south-west into the great and lonely Pacific expanse
BTS He dropped his burden in the corner by the stove and wiped his face on a coarse bandana handkerchief
BTS From half-past five in the morning till ten o'clock at night I am everybody's slave with not one moment to myself except such as I can steal near the end of the second dog-watch
BTS He insisted that I succeeded in cutting his work in half
BTS When driven with his mates to the new owners' camp Buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair tent half stretched dishes unwashed everything in disorder
BTS It took me no little while to puzzle it out but I finally discovered that it was because I was more luckily born than he gentleman born he put it
BTS Gold said Mr
BTS But such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society
BTS But you do not realize Ernest answered
BTS Well you can make up your mind to have it taken out of you on this craft
BTS Every urge of his being impelled him to spring upon the pack that cried at his heels but it was the will of the gods that this should not be
BTS Early in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted accident
BTS He was self-educated had taught himself German and French and at that time was earning a meagre living by translating scientific and philosophical works for a struggling socialist publishing house in Chicago
BTS In charging it to the public it was charged to the great mass of unorganized labor and of weakly organized labor
BTS Tears were in Maud's eyes and I do believe they were for me
BTS All this was a matter of development and took time
BTS Now what of the lady
BTS Then I spoke frankly telling him what I was enduring from Thomas Mugridge because of the three days of favouritism which had been shown me
BTS I'll be back at ten o'clock again
BTS He came out of a thicket and found himself face to face with the slow-witted bird
BTS Men told this to one another and looked each time to see it happen
BTS He hated and feared their hands
BTS How could he have been an eagle and not have pride
BTS At last he arose in a weary manner as though all the resilience had gone out of his body and proceeded to fasten the dogs to the sled
BTS The rope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current he was jerked under the surface and under the surface he remained till his body struck against the bank and he was hauled out
BTS Once out of the harness and down he did not get on his feet again till harness-up time in the morning
BTS And not for nothing had his puppyhood been made bitter by the persecution of Lip-lip and the whole puppy pack
BTS On the instant a score of the famished brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon
BTS His hunting had been good and for a week he had eaten his fill
BTS I was explaining why I testified at the trial the way I did--why I followed instructions
BTS His mother and fear impelled him to keep away from the white wall
BTS It was a mad revolt
BTS Hartman and I agreed that it was useless to report ourselves to the local chiefs of the secret service
BTS but Perrault to make up lost time pushed them late and early
BTS Scott
BTS but we all knew what he did before he died
BTS It is revolting
BTS And then father was arrested for attempted assault fined in the police court and bound over to keep the peace
BTS Well Henry
BTS Other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a sense of duty and business expediency
BTS I read the unspoken question there was it right
BTS But the Bishop in spite of the gentleness and purity of his spirit was possessed of guile
BTS But Leach took it quite calmly though blood was spouting upon the deck as generously as water from a fountain
BTS And Hartman was right
BTS My train was four hours late
BTS He was making some sort of rattan-work and he toiled on stolidly while I talked with him
BTS But he was further the fiercest of the litter
BTS She's given them that kind of fun before
BTS My whole world was turning over
BTS You have not told the whole story I said with conviction
BTS These great editions were paid for and distributed by the small army of voluntary workers who had marshalled around the Appeal
BTS Time and again when a mob of them was well in hand and being driven along the streets to the water the comrades would create a diversion and the mob would escape through the consequent hole torn in the encircling net
BTS Also his earnings were added to by the royalties from the small sales of his own economic and philosophic works
BTS In ways it was indeed good that he was not flighty and imaginative
BTS And when all was done I gave up like a woman and rolled upon the deck in the agony of exhaustion
BTS There is such a thing as civil law Mr
BTS You see the masters are quite sure that they are right in what they are doing
BTS I must in some way break in and lead the conversation into other channels
BTS It is a good word  I began
BTS The oil income was swelling swelling and the number of sound investments limited even more limited than it is now
BTS Vast populations grew frenzied over such phrases as an honest dollar and a full dinner pail
BTS He raged through the camp smelling and digging in every likely place snarling so frightfully that Pike heard and shivered in his hiding-place
BTS Despite continual and almost inconceivable hazards Anna Roylston lived to the royal age of ninety-one
BTS Things no longer went right
BTS In the face of labor-saving machinery of organized production of the increased efficiency of combination you would set the economic sun back a whole generation or so to the time when there were no great capitalists no great machinery no railroads--a time when a host of little capitalists warred with each other in economic anarchy and when production was primitive wasteful unorganized and costly
BTS He would have been glad for the rattle of stones about him flung by an angry squaw glad for the hand of Grey Beaver descending upon him in wrath
BTS The damp straw of the mattress fired from beneath and denied air had been smouldering all the while
BTS No it is not the hunger that makes the heart ache she explained
BTS CHAPTER XXXVII At once we moved aboard the Ghost occupying our old state-rooms and cooking in the galley
BTS One or the other must give over and that one was White Fang
BTS It is perhaps well to tell a little something about this obscure document which in the main is of interest to the historian only
BTS The footing looked good
BTS Don't you see your position gentlemen
BTS His behavior in our drawing-room reminded me of a careful bull in a china shop
BTS White Fang did not give the alarm by barking
BTS All her suspicions were justified
BTS I have thought about it often and I know
BTS A labour-saving device for mariners navigation reduced to kindergarten simplicity he answered gaily
BTS Calvin answered and he looked belligerent enough
BTS He had made Jackson answer damaging questions
BTS There'll be more than smoke in my petards
BTS One Eye moved slightly and peered forth with increased eagerness
BTS You have a firm and abiding belief that you were created for the sole purpose of making profits
BTS he asked
BTS You're off colour that's what's the matter with you Henry dogmatised
BTS Our boats were rowing as well as sailing
BTS He buckled down with a will and did his best though it was all new and strange
BTS With the exception of several bad wounds the rest were merely severe bruises and lacerations
BTS but the enormous strength of the man was too much for my fortitude
BTS 'Tis not what I mean but what the Wolf 'll mean
BTS that legacy of the Wild which no animal may escape nor exchange for pottage
BTS But I shall menace their money-bags
BTS but in moments like this I regret my unbelief
BTS There was no pulling and hauling on sheets and tackles no shifting of topsails no work at all for the sailors to do except to steer
BTS Even as late as 1912 A
BTS These deposits are saved for old age for sickness and accident and for funeral expenses
BTS White Fang watched it all with eager eyes and when the tepees began to come down and the canoes were loading at the bank he understood
BTS Dead
BTS The cap'n is Wolf Larsen or so men call him
BTS I do not understand Bishop Morehouse said
BTS Here the seals hauled out and the old bulls guarded their harems while the young bulls hauled out by themselves
BTS They constituted the balance of power in the struggles between the labor castes and the oligarchs and now to one side and now to the other threw their strength according to the play of intrigue and conspiracy
BTS 'According to common custom you might give me a dime
BTS Buck's feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies
BTS Again and yet again White Fang sprang in slashed and got away untouched and still his strange foe followed after him without too great haste not slowly but deliberately and determinedly in a businesslike sort of way
BTS But then life seems absurd to-day what of the machinations of the Plutocracy
BTS There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life and beyond which life cannot rise
BTS Every animal was motionless as though turned to stone
BTS But there was another sound
BTS He ate the meat and nothing happened
BTS I had already determined to I said coldly
BTS He was to select the moment for the throwing of the bomb and he naively confesses that in his interest in Everhard's tirade and the general commotion raised thereby he nearly forgot his mission
BTS Maud
BTS he demanded
BTS You'd hardly expect them to avoid Wolf Larsen without my feet inside of them
BTS I demanded with an abruptness that in turn startled her
BTS He went on and traced his life in the mills the learning of the horseshoeing trade and his meeting with the socialists
BTS Yet such fears were groundless
BTS I promise you
BTS Mine I knew were speaking beyond the will of my speech
BTS Thornton had been hurried into the wager heavy with doubt
BTS Then stay with us and discuss it
BTS The last line was down
BTS But White Fang knew that he had broken the law of the gods
BTS From then on it was war between them
BTS There is yet a chance to stop it I said if nothing happens to the train and I can get there in time
BTS Then blisters came in a painful and never-ending procession and I had a great burn on my forearm acquired by losing my balance in a roll of the ship and pitching against the galley stove
BTS Not alone with their own eyes did they see the wolfish creature in the clear light of day standing before them
BTS I lowered the gun and stepped to the corner of the cabin primarily to relieve the tension on my nerves and to make a new start and incidentally to be closer
BTS into steamships and steamboats and telegraphy
BTS He ran always on her right side
BTS Disappearance was one of the horrors of the time
BTS But Wolf Larsen cried out to him Cooky you've got to hustle to-night
BTS but the next day and for many days to follow they broke their own trail worked harder and made poorer time
BTS Time passed
BTS He sat up on his haunches and ki-yi'd
BTS Regularly each morning after he had finished his breakfast she performed her self-appointed task till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for Thornton's
BTS If not amity at least neutrality must obtain
BTS He did not reason the question out in this man fashion
BTS It was a logical and crushing indictment of the whole system of education that developed in the minds of the students only such ideas as were favorable to the capitalistic regime to the exclusion of all ideas that were inimical and subversive
BTS When I turned around a moment later I saw the cabin-boy staggering to his feet
BTS The outlook was black indeed and I went about my work with a heavy heart
BTS Yes sir
BTS Then he turned and bent over White Fang standing by his side
BTS The hunters laughed from sheer relief
BTS I hesitated the desire to race back and up the steps to the deck almost overpowering me
BTS There buzzing in the air at the tip of his nose was a lone mosquito
BTS I cried five minutes later
BTS Far from her intention her words were maddening me driving me on
BTS But to prevent them from getting behind him he was forced back down past the pool and into the creek bed till he brought up against a high gravel bank
BTS In the juggling of events such a war would cause in the reshuffling of the international cards and the making of new treaties and alliances the Oligarchy had much to gain
BTS I struggled to my feet with difficulty dragging myself clear of the wrecked door unaware of any hurt whatever
BTS We leaned toward each other and before I knew it my arms were about her
BTS Who controls the government to-day
BTS But everything was grist to the Iron Heel
BTS In Chicago there are women who toil all the week for ninety cents
BTS There must have been more men in the conspiracy to murder the captain and mate for by the sounds I knew that Leach and Johnson had been quickly reinforced by some of their mates
BTS Another man's life I mean
BTS You can prove anything by metaphysics
BTS They became villeins in short--serfs bound to the soil by a living wage
BTS He continued copying lines and figures upon the transparent scale
BTS '  God strike me dead 'Ump if that ayn't wot 'e sez an' me a-sittin' there in 'is own cabin jolly-like an' comfortable a-smokin' 'is cigars an' drinkin' 'is rum
BTS He never chummed with other dogs
BTS That is a fact
BTS he demanded
BTS You have already managed me with your eyes commanded me with them
BTS No chance at all Henry concluded
BTS It was poor taste on my part and very inconsiderate
BTS As it is it's in a nasty prison and you'll do him only a kindness by breaking down the door
BTS A chance bomb must have exploded among them for the mob checked until its dead and dying formed the wave had white-capped and flung forward its foam of living fighting slaves
BTS One Eye watching felt a sudden moistness in his mouth and a drooling of saliva involuntary excited by the living meat that was spreading itself like a repast before him
BTS When they halted it halted throwing up its head and regarding them steadily with nostrils that twitched as it caught and studied the scent of them
BTS Later in the morning I received a surprise of a totally different sort
BTS Look up the reporters that kept Jackson's case out of the papers and the editors that run the papers
BTS I can never forget the flaying he gave them at the end  This figure arises from the customs of the times
BTS I went back to my horse blankets and waited an hour for Garthwaite
BTS And third he must act for the benefit of his race
BTS This much I learned of him before I went to bed and I lay long awake listening in memory to the sound of his voice
BTS And then suddenly without warning uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal John Thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club
BTS But I do not feel calm
BTS In the summer when there is a rush order I work from five in the morning to nine at night
BTS I went on deck
BTS I know that you will not vote for this bill Ernest went on
BTS Johnson shouted in my ear as we successfully came through the attendant deluge and I knew he referred not to Wolf Larsen's seamanship but to the performance of the Ghost herself
BTS What's the drift eh
BTS The men slept breathing heavily side by side under the one covering
BTS The Iron Heel will use all its power to prevent it but it will fail
BTS for these were women of my own kind like my mother and sisters with the fear of death upon them and unwilling to die
BTS Jackson I could not escape
BTS It was Wolf Larsen's turn to be puzzled
BTS I had not thought of it I replied wagging my head sagely
BTS And he certainly looked it with those bulging muscles and that bull-throat
BTS Let the abysmal brute roar and the police and Mercenaries slay
BTS The Bishop was aghast and my father chuckled
BTS Then it was cold
BTS When the word goes forth the labor hosts of all the world shall rise
BTS And on no day did they succeed in making more than half the distance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food computation
BTS The proletariat gets its lesson to-day but it gives one too
BTS He ran on a few steps stopped and looked back
BTS Again I repeated the question
BTS Stay and watch it
BTS but as he had no knowledge of the wide world outside he was never oppressed by the narrow confines of his existence
BTS They threw themselves against the breast-bands dug their feet into the packed snow got down low to it and put forth all their strength
BTS I cried out
BTS Steering I picked up easily but running aloft to the crosstrees and swinging my whole weight by my arms when I left the ratlines and climbed still higher was more difficult
BTS His teeth closed upon the rabbit and he bore it back to earth with him
BTS Stop it if you can
BTS That would have been terrible
BTS The great captains of industry the oligarchs had for the first time thrown their full weight into the breach the struggling employers' associations had made
BTS But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind
BTS Then the sharp cry of a squaw inside sent him scampering back to Kiche
BTS Prove it he challenged
BTS But there was one particular nightmare from which he suffered the clanking clanging monsters of electric cars that were to him colossal screaming lynxes
BTS Matt made a couple of steps toward White Fang but the latter slid away from him
BTS The capsized sled ground over him and the dogs dashed on up the street adding to the gayety of Skaguay as they scattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare
BTS Even then White Fang was not premature
BTS There was no doubt that we had escaped unseen
BTS Then everything went black before my eyes
BTS Ernest proceeded with his attack
BTS I love you
BTS What is the matter
BTS The boss is kind
BTS I may make or break you
BTS 'Ere she comes
BTS So he worked hard learned discipline and was obedient
BTS When I knocked the shackle-bolt loose the chain roared out through the hawse-hole and into the sea
BTS Into the clearing where the moonlight streamed they poured in a silvery flood
BTS Possibly because of some fault that had occurred when the knolls were flung together and certainly helped by freakish erosion the hole had been scooped out in the course of centuries by the wash of water
BTS It was patent that our comrades were in one building that Mercenaries were in the other and that they were fighting across the street
BTS It was in February 1912 that I first met him when as a guest of my father's at dinner he came to our house in Berkeley
BTS Got rid of her pilots and running into San Francisco
BTS They are plentifully distributed over this part of the ocean
BTS and then for some time he was silent
BTS Men stared at him poked sticks between the bars to make him snarl and then laughed at him
BTS Everhard's social foresight was remarkable
BTS I asked her the hours she worked and she said it depended on the season
BTS The earth is as full of brutality as the sea is full of motion
BTS I know it's a sort of machine-breaking and that it is absurd
BTS The United States and Brazil must both seek out other countries with undeveloped resources in order to unload the surpluses on them
BTS Not a line of which will appear in to-morrow's papers
BTS There was no wind the tide was high and the schooner floated
BTS Some time later as he was going aboard his steamer to sail to England he was approached by another reporter who wanted to know if he had changed his opinion of Chicago
BTS I remember writing a review of a thin little volume  I had begun carelessly when she interrupted me
BTS I promise you a great caterwauling and an illuminating insight into the nature of the beast
BTS All this in frankness to show my first impression after long denial of women in general and of Maud Brewster in particular
BTS P
BTS Don't deny it
BTS Come here you whatever-your-name-is
BTS But in a short while his fear of the tepees passed away
BTS It did not take long to carry out this programme--only several weeks
BTS And I was not
BTS Instead of the whole country being hand in hand in revolt they were all alone and the total strength of the Oligarchy could have been directed against them if necessary
BTS The capitalistic system so far as they were concerned had hopelessly broken down
BTS and even then in his own pitiable plight White Fang experienced a little grateful thrill
BTS She was rushing around on her heel into the wind
BTS Just then my father came in and began making preparations to depart with me
BTS I shall prove the contrary was the retort
BTS And that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling ages
BTS Milk was raised a cent a quart
BTS painful to be weak because of the penalties
BTS What did he say
BTS He had the gift of lucidity
BTS He was a large man poorly dressed and on his back was a great load of rattan and bamboo stands chairs and screens
BTS though I could not quite rid myself of the idea that right conduct for me lay in killing him
BTS Another famous organization of women was The Widows of War
BTS He had used the phrase social revolution
BTS and I flatter myself that I did his work well
BTS All I do is to put it on a star revolve the scale till it is opposite those figures on the map underneath and presto
BTS It had not been mighty enough to face the organized wolf-pack of society
BTS Colonel Ingram is a great lawyer
BTS You call it the Plutocracy
BTS Put Cooky to work on it
BTS Never had I seen so profound a despair as that which I saw on his face the face of Wolf Larsen the fighter the strong man the indomitable one
BTS Lip-lip essayed to back away but White Fang struck him hard shoulder to shoulder
BTS Weakness is wrong
BTS They are no good sir
BTS And within him it aroused feelings which he had likewise never experienced before
BTS They went into the multitudinous divisions of the government took service in the colonial possessions and by tens of thousands went into the various secret services
BTS Henry left the cooking to come and see
BTS One man cannot wrong another man
BTS All night with burning brands he fought off the hungry pack
BTS In return he guarded the god's property defended his body worked for him and obeyed him
BTS I raced aft putting the wheel up
BTS but at the time he suspected nothing
BTS Beauty Smith his hands still behind him began to back away
BTS It was preacher's night as my father privately called it and Ernest was certainly out of place in the midst of the churchmen
BTS Out of the flux of transition the new institutions were forming more definitely and taking on the appearance and attributes of permanence
BTS while Dub an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught was punished for Buck's misdeed
BTS and third to drive in with his teeth at the soft throat
BTS It was dry and cosey
BTS This under his direction I cleansed and sewed together having first shaved the edges of the wound
BTS No noise understand no noise
BTS And keep you I will
BTS You must begin over again
BTS Please please she said oh so softly
BTS Day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller and though one day was very like another it was apparent to Buck that the weather was steadily growing colder
BTS Charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could which was not in the least well
BTS As before the Ghost swung out of the trough lifting her deck again out of the sea and dashed before the howling blast
BTS I asked the cook
BTS That is the women shrank and fear was in their faces
BTS The feel of spring was in the air the feel of growing life under the snow of sap ascending in the trees of buds bursting the shackles of the frost
BTS He knew only that they did threaten evil of some sort and that it was best for him to keep out of their reach
BTS Served me right Matt argued stubbornly
BTS This gave place to a sense of intolerable anguish
BTS In the files of the OUTLOOK a critical weekly of the period in the number dated August 18 1906 is related the circumstance of a workingman losing his arm the details of which are quite similar to those of Jackson's case as related by Avis Everhard
BTS The other unions will be ground out of existence--all of them
BTS The rabbit could not turn and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek
BTS and here he muses for a time howling once long and mournfully ere he departs
BTS His two dogs were missing and he well knew that they had served as a course in the protracted meal which had begun days before with Fatty the last course of which would likely be himself in the days to follow
BTS Mash his brains out
BTS We discovered that we were pawns
BTS They were camped near the log store where she in her friendly way made advances to a husky dog the size of a full-grown wolf though not half so large as she
BTS Then it was that we socialists reaped the fruit of Hearst's pseudo-socialistic preaching
BTS Ernest and his fellow-leaders from their prisons decided what should be done
BTS Their code has been drummed into your head from the time you lisped and in spite of your philosophy and of what I have taught you it won't let you kill an unarmed unresisting man
BTS The boy glowered sullenly but refused to move
BTS His mind was rather hazy concerning the damage suit
BTS Lip-lip was White Fang's own kind and being only a puppy did not seem dangerous
BTS Also he doesn't want to get drunk
BTS And it wanted the war for a dozen reasons
BTS But White Fang was not demonstrative
BTS I had but to look at her or think of her and be strong again
BTS That was all
BTS When I had finished washing the dishes I cleaned the cabin stove and carried the ashes up on deck to empty them
BTS Under the whiskers and all unseen I knew that the skin was taking on a purplish hue
BTS This it was I am certain the most indescribable of blood-curdling sounds that threw me into a panic
BTS The daily press
BTS They called me 'scab
BTS The dear and lovely woman
BTS As I felt about among his blankets something hot fell on the back of my hand
BTS Often in the early morning or in the evening after dark Carlson would steal down to the refuge and work for a couple of hours
BTS You and Ernest will have to get married pretty quickly
BTS Like had been replaced by love
BTS Again they fell to quoting and Maud gave Dowson's Impenitentia Ultima
BTS And long before his eyes had opened he had learned by touch taste and smell to know his mother a fount of warmth and liquid food and tenderness
BTS but to-day she stands in imperishable bronze in the Pantheon of Brotherhood in the wonder city of Serles
BTS His eyes were blinded so that he could not see and the blood running from ears and nose and mouth turned the cabin into a shambles
BTS If you will read your biology and your sociology as clearly as you do your history you will see that this end I have described is inevitable
BTS Come now what is it worth
BTS Their bristly fur was rimed with frost
BTS They will build as the Egyptians and the Babylonians never dreamed of building
BTS Mine
BTS I laughed incredulously
BTS What if I should cry out
BTS The explanation is simple
BTS Van Weyden
BTS Her face was distorted and malignant with menace even the bridge of the nose wrinkling from tip to eyes so prodigious was her snarl
BTS You're right Bill he concluded
BTS Many things were to occur simultaneously when the signal went forth
BTS And never had the white men seemed such marvellous gods as now when he trod the slimy pavement of San Francisco
BTS I remember how he forced the hunter and his two men below a rifle at their breasts when their captain passed by at biscuit-toss and hailed us for information
BTS Henry groaned as he passed from sleep to waking and demanded What's wrong now
BTS Philosophers
BTS Growl he would from the moment the petting began till it ended
BTS Also he has legs to stand on
BTS Beauty Smith was frightened and angry
BTS He had shown signs of consciousness and she had spoken to him eliciting no response
BTS Three dogs could not drag the sled so fast nor for so long hours as could six and they were showing unmistakable signs of playing out
BTS His victory over Death Larsen seemed to have had a remarkable effect upon him
BTS Make fast
BTS We ran on to the north and west till we raised the coast of Japan and picked up with the great seal herd
BTS If I was President of the United Stytes to-morrer 'ow would it fill my belly for one time w'en I was a kiddy and it went empty
BTS But it was no longer his body it seemed so far away
BTS For look you he was saying as I see it a man does things because of desire
BTS Powerful influences must have been brought to bear hence its suppression
BTS I rowed into the adjoining cove and up to the edge of the beach
BTS and in the woods side by side White Fang ran with Collie as his mother Kiche and old One Eye had run long years before in the silent Northland forest
BTS At the end of an hour the single and double blocks came together at the top of the shears
BTS he cried savagely shaking his fist at the hungry beasts
BTS They composed the watch on deck and it was the ship's custom in good weather to let the watch sleep with the exception of the officer the helmsman and the look-out
BTS Now it happened that Leach was one of the sailors told off to douse Mugridge after his game of cards with the captain
BTS Colonel Van Gilbert was a great corporation lawyer
BTS Before I had time to express any desire to know he had me by the throat with his gorilla grip and by a faint quiver of the muscles a hint as it were he suggested to me the twist that would surely have broken my neck
BTS and at the third the boat-steerer let loose his steering-oar and crumpled up in the bottom of the boat
BTS What was he
BTS He no longer marched
BTS It is the darkness of death the ceasing to be the ceasing to feel the ceasing to move that is gathering about you descending upon you rising around you
BTS you get nowhere
BTS He on the other hand being the fastest-footed was unafraid to venture anywhere
BTS His contention was that it was finer for a finite mortal speck of life to feel Godlike than for a god to feel godlike
BTS It would be a most moral act to rid the world of such a monster
BTS Nor did he like it when the man-animals arose and went on with their march
BTS I waved my hand back and forth of course without effect
BTS Matt how much is a good sled-dog worth
BTS And if he interferes  But I dare not stay ashore all night alone Maud was saying when I came back to myself
BTS You are   I was on the verge of saying my woman my mate but glibly changed it to standing the hardship well
BTS They gathered together in bands in order to go to work or to return from work
BTS Then there was his lightning quickness
BTS Buck was raging
BTS I was ignorant of the simplest duties of mate and would have fared badly indeed had the sailors not sympathized with me
BTS I know that I slipped down into the steerage in a daze and that I was just beginning the ascent to the deck a loaded shot-gun in my hands when I heard the startled cry There's five men in that boat
BTS Hammerfield said We do not mind the truth that is in any man
BTS Unless One Ear gnawed 'm loose
BTS An' 'ere I am now
BTS But no thing of fear pounced out and when he had gained the inside he scouted carefully around looking at it and finding it not
BTS Yes eighty-three
BTS I shall use my judgment when to look and when not to look she replied with a grand air
BTS He is a shrewd lawyer
BTS I spik true w'en I say dat Buck two devils
BTS I thought it a certain silly fastidiousness on my part but it persisted in spite of me and I merely shrugged my shoulders in answer
BTS Ah but it is cowardly cowardly
BTS All day he ran
BTS For the Ghost so far as the seamen were concerned was a hell-ship of the worst description
BTS It was a colossal plan--too colossal to be wrought by the genius of one man alone
BTS White Fang hesitated
BTS But that is not the teaching of Christ
BTS My
BTS The aim of life was meat
BTS but Kloo-kooch welcomed him with glad cries and the whole of a fresh-caught fish and he lay down to wait Grey Beaver's coming
BTS From my place in the gallery I saw nothing except the flash of the explosion
BTS It is a canard got up by you socialists
BTS In the eyes of society it will truly be insanity he replied
BTS We had no more than begun work when the sound of my knocking and hammering brought Wolf Larsen
BTS I stole into his state-room and possessed myself of his revolvers
BTS At the instant his jaws closed on it White Fang struck him
BTS They were hard as iron
BTS You see he went on as though addressing his neglected mother across half the girth of the earth each year I was going home
BTS How clearly he thought and how well he expressed what he thought
BTS Three Eagles was going away on a trip up the Mackenzie to the Great Slave Lake
BTS also my wisdom returned with me
BTS His voice sounded hoarse and unreal and he had spoken with apparent effort
BTS The sled swayed and trembled half-started forward
BTS The Mercenaries constituted a race apart
BTS Can we make it work
BTS In all truth there in the labor-ghettos is the roaring abysmal beast the oligarchs fear so dreadfully--but it is the beast of their own making
BTS It's no square Wolf Larsen said
BTS Distribution was as confused and irrational as the whole general system of society
BTS Once out of his presence I calculated the time
BTS Before that he had recoiled automatically from hurt as he had crawled automatically toward the light
BTS It went over suddenly burying its gunwale level with the sea and shipping a bucketful or so of water
BTS I had actually at times considered myself outside the pale a monkish fellow denied the eternal or the passing passions I saw and understood so well in others
BTS Charles demanded rather shortly
BTS I'm just reading Browning he confessed and it's pretty tough
BTS The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test
BTS And again with never-failing wonder I remarked the total lack of viciousness or wickedness or sinfulness in his face
BTS As the Pococks defied the executioners of the Fighting Groups so she defied the executioners of the Iron Heel
BTS He notched the stick at each end and in the notches fastened strings of raw-hide
BTS while Dave who was an experienced wheeler nipped Buck's hind quarters whenever he was in error
BTS Where does the power lie gentlemen
BTS I do not know whether Wolf Larsen cheated or not a thing he was thoroughly capable of doing but he won steadily
BTS We want in our hands the reins of power and the destiny of mankind
BTS It was not alone what he had said and how he had said it but it was the man himself
BTS Or is it a misconception of mine that shipwrecked people are always shown every consideration
BTS I was fascinated by the fascinated look he bent upon Maud
BTS For several days there had been a great hubbub in the village
BTS Brushing the ashes from his clothes he had resumed his conversation with Henderson
BTS At last the gage of battle had been thrown down
BTS White Fang did not wait
BTS They only laughed and poked sticks at him which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that that was what they wanted
BTS In the end one day fear and obedience were swept away by the rush of life and the cub straddled and sprawled toward the entrance
BTS I could be happy anywhere with Ernest
BTS Johansen
BTS From the deck to the truck of the maintopmast is something over a hundred feet while the foremast with its topmast is eight or ten feet shorter
BTS that is the message of the Church today
BTS Mercedes dried her eyes and looked at John Thornton
BTS Our boats hunted across the two or three miles of water between them and the point where the Macedonia's had been dropped and then headed for home
BTS The game of revolution was a game of life and death and mere accessories were traps
BTS As I say while I appreciated the power of the terrific denunciation that swept out of Wolf Larsen's mouth I was inexpressibly shocked
BTS Do you know what they do to poor men in the States who like you do not work for their living
BTS It reminded me of the problem of lifting oneself by one's boot-straps
BTS They might do as they pleased amongst themselves
BTS I sat down and pondered the problem
BTS Wolf Larsen and Henderson were standing near the wheel deep in conversation
BTS Be true to your salt and your hire
BTS The cook made repeated journeys to his bunk for money
BTS but that there was talk and that I would understand
BTS for he had to make a living in addition to all his other labor
BTS I heard Maud cry in dismay and suddenly stop
BTS If there had been one mast standing something high up to which to fasten blocks and tackles
BTS The flesh and the qualms of the flesh she was heir to but the flesh bore heavily only on the flesh
BTS Being sled-leader was anything but gratifying to him
BTS He was a good runner swifter than any puppy of his size and swifter than Lip-lip
BTS Without discussion it was the agents-provocateurs who caused the Peasant Revolt
BTS The porcupine rolled itself into a ball radiating long sharp needles in all directions that defied attack
BTS Scott shouted as he sprang outside
BTS But to die this way
BTS We exchanged nothing more than good-mornings and though he could not see he sat on the rail out of the way and followed by the sound all that I did
BTS but don't you think your measures were rather heroic
BTS as is the good so is the sinner
BTS he roared at them
BTS The Group was composed only of men
BTS And now we shift from this particular process to the sum total of all industrial processes in the United States which includes the leather itself raw material transportation selling everything
BTS commented Judge Scott
BTS She placed the tips of her fingers on them
BTS All day we sailed and all night and the next day and the next day after day the wind always astern and blowing steadily and strong
BTS Environment served to model the clay to give it a particular form
BTS Children six and seven years of age working every night at twelve-hour shifts
BTS And now the next point
BTS It was a most wasteful expenditure of energy
BTS Here Grey Beaver stopped
BTS That's all right old fellow you just run along home ran the talk
BTS And this I doubt not they will go on doing to the end of time
BTS What is to become of the other unions
BTS And as he had seen horses work so he was set to work hauling Francois on a sled to the forest that fringed the valley and returning with a load of firewood
BTS She quit her antics and quieted down for a long minute
BTS Half an hour passed an hour
BTS Remains the proletariat
BTS Johnson looked at me and I could see that his face was worn and haggard
BTS All their old liberties were gone
BTS He had never been struck by a club in his life and did not understand
BTS I have now given the true disappearance of Philip Wickson one-time oligarch and later comrade in the Revolution
BTS He turned to the other men who were anxious to speak
BTS You said to give him a chance
BTS White Fang sliding by in quest of meat stopped and began to eat the chips
BTS He would stand off at a little distance and look on while stones clubs axes and all sorts of weapons fell upon his fellows
BTS But this is my vessel my particular property
BTS Left to myself I proceeded to cook breakfast on the oil stove and to prepare my home
BTS He had been lying down in an abandon of comfort but he arose quickly and as the man arrived slid away in true wolf-fashion to the edge of the camp
BTS David Graham Phillips was a radical writer of the period and the quotation by him is taken from a copy of the Saturday Evening Post dated October 4 1902 A
BTS I ceased waving my hand so that the shadow remained stationary
BTS She inspected it with painstaking care while One Eye who had returned stood in the entrance and patiently watched her
BTS By his side were Bishop Dickinson
BTS He too was bound upon the wheel
BTS And when the sun was up I was scorched and because I had no root I withered away
BTS Ernest's arm about me was eloquent with love
BTS The cook stuck his head out of the galley door and grinned encouragingly at me at the same time jerking his thumb in the direction of the man who paced up and down by the hatchway
BTS Only I guess we know what's best for us a little bit better than you do
BTS Damn sight better dead and outa your reach than alive and in your clutches
BTS Mr
BTS Look at that Bill Henry whispered
BTS The case would not have been decided against him had there been no more to the affair than you have mentioned
BTS But I've stayed by the company through two strikes
BTS White Fang hanging limply continued to cry
BTS Every effort was made by the Oligarchy to save him
BTS I was no longer Humphrey Van Weyden
BTS Capital furnished the factory the machines and paid all the expenses
BTS Again he said and at length and with distressing detail that the Church had wandered away from the Master's teaching and that Mammon had been instated in the place of Christ
BTS A strong hand gripped me and when the Ghost finally emerged I found that I owed my life to Johnson
BTS The blessed woman was an unfailing fount of power to me
BTS Again and this time with purpose did Grey Beaver kick him
BTS In addition to the labor troubles and the discontent of the farmers and of the remnant of the middle class a religious revival had blazed up
BTS As I followed him I noted that in spite of rack and ruin a rough order obtained
BTS This body was made for use
BTS This was living though he did not know it
BTS The supply is too large
BTS They talked it over at meal-time and over their last pipes before going to bed and one night they held a consultation
BTS he demanded
BTS It took its rise out of the tittle-tattle and tale-bearing which had been the cause of Johnson's beating and from the noise we heard and from the sight of the bruised men next day it was patent that half the forecastle had soundly drubbed the other half
BTS The terrific gong was a frying-pan hanging on the wall that rattled and clattered with each leap of the ship
BTS Oh I don't know
BTS It bit like fire and the next instant was gone
BTS nothing perhaps to the nights we should go through in this cockle-shell
BTS He dodged this way and that and curved and turned but to no purpose
BTS For his task he elected a vengeance on the shark
BTS It cried out with terror at the same time snarling and scrambled back to cool its paws in the snow
BTS The bird made a startled rise but he struck it with his paw and smashed it down to earth then pounced upon it and caught it in his teeth as it scuttled across the snow trying to rise in the air again
BTS Then One Eye creeping and crawling every sense on the alert every hair radiating infinite suspicion joined her
BTS After that they ran side by side like good friends who have come to an understanding
BTS But that mental power was yet in the future
BTS Neither could he mobilize his army to go forth to war nor could he punish his recalcitrant subjects
BTS There is no getting away from it
BTS But why stronger
BTS But now alas how welcome would have been the feel of their presence the frou-frou and swish-swish of their skirts which I had so cordially detested
BTS CHAPTER XV LAST DAYS It was near the end of January 1913 that the changed attitude of the Oligarchy toward the favored unions was made public
BTS the rest of the team was strung out ahead single file to the leader which position was filled by Spitz
BTS The swelling had not gone down and the cap was still up on edge
BTS I tried to tell him my gladness at meeting him and that he must come right home with me
BTS It never gave the satisfaction the old windlass had given but it worked and made my work possible
BTS Who goes first
BTS Oofty-Oofty laid hold of Parsons's thumb pulling it out stoutly and snapping it back into place
BTS He noticed my involuntary twitching and grimacing and smirked I only 'ope yer don't ever 'ave to get used to such as that in this life 'cos you've got a bloomin' soft skin that you 'ave more like a lydy's than any I know of
BTS He had been guilty of running the Ghost several points off her course in order that what little wind there was should fill the foresail and hold it steady
BTS He walked boldly about the camp inflicting punishment in the night for what he had suffered in the day
BTS They see clearly as far as they see but they see only to the ends of their noses
BTS These men here shoot seals in order to live
BTS The Church is not teaching Christ these days Ernest put in quickly
BTS My next thought was that Maud and I might yet escape
BTS The willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds
BTS Editorial policy he said
BTS Are you in pain
BTS and in this fashion Buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence
BTS It developed what little executive ability I possessed and I was aware of a toughening or hardening which I was undergoing and which could not be anything but wholesome for Sissy Van Weyden
BTS Ernest asked when the merriment had subsided
BTS I ain't afraid
BTS And yet here you are at the top of your life where diminishing and dying begin living an obscure and sordid existence hunting sea animals for the satisfaction of woman's vanity and love of decoration revelling in a piggishness to use your own words which is anything and everything except splendid
BTS Wolf Larsen dropped my hand with a flirt of disdain
BTS The doctors recommended a sea voyage and I chose the longest
BTS You'd better stick by the sled his partner protested
BTS The bull-dog did little but keep his grip
BTS she asked
BTS The eyes only moved
BTS It's more a feeling on my part than anything else
BTS and the dogs grew excited and frightened and were guilty of panics that tangled the traces and further depressed the two men
BTS In spite of himself and all the pricking warnings of his instinct White Fang began to have confidence in this god
BTS I felt her mittened hand come out to mine
BTS Gun in hand he plunged into the underbrush that lined the side of the trail
BTS You never made anything in your own sweat
BTS We had been so long upon the moving rocking sea that the stable land was a shock to us
BTS Nobody spoke
BTS It was not in the mate's province to go out in the boats and though I manoeuvred cunningly for it Wolf Larsen never granted me the privilege
BTS From the forest came the call or one note of it for the call was many noted distinct and definite as never before a long-drawn howl like yet unlike any noise made by husky dog
BTS I was just a-wonderin' that is all
BTS I remembered the watch-tackle a small double and single block affair and fetched it
BTS And despite the absence of confidence and trust we were compelled to base our every effort on confidence and trust
BTS As he did so a draught of air fanned him and a large winged body swept ominously and silently past
BTS For I had been elevating her too highly in my concepts of her removing her too far from the plane of the human and too far from me
BTS It was dawn of the second day
BTS It is the soul that decides
BTS Thank God we are not scientists Dr
BTS He dropped the whip and shielded his throat with his arms
BTS By means of the watch-tackle I had made a new one I heaved the butt of the foremast across the rail and then lowered it to the deck
BTS He dodged
BTS It's not the nature of life to be otherwise
BTS The conditions were frightful
BTS You'd have robbed him most probably I answered
BTS There were no more spats and squabbles no more tiny rages nor attempts at growling
BTS Now and again he raised his head to note the dying down of the fire
BTS This was reputed to be the fastest train in the world then
BTS Before a month went by Knowlton paid for his treason with his life
BTS What we've got to do is actually and literally to clear that raffle
BTS He could not tolerate them
BTS And I was frightened when I became conscious of the trend of my thought
BTS but what a pony is I don't know
BTS that too too flattering review
BTS There was too much of the fighting beast in him
BTS A shout from Francois hailed his appearance
BTS Perrault found one with head buried in the grub-box
BTS Then he broke loose
BTS But you'll do
BTS Sooner or later he would accomplish his purpose get the grip that would win the battle
BTS I've talked to him like a brother but it's little he sees in takin' in his lights or flyin' false signals
BTS And the sun is gone she said her eyes still fixed upon our island where we had proved our mastery over matter and attained to the truest comradeship that may fall to man and woman
BTS I asked
BTS He is overwrought
BTS These were always males and they were pressingly insistent on joining with One Eye and his mate
BTS The socialists were revolutionists he said struggling to overthrow the irrational society of the present and out of the material to build the rational society of the future
BTS In the past he had liked comfort and surcease from pain disliked discomfort and pain and he had adjusted his actions accordingly
BTS He told us much though he told us more of the joy he had experienced in doing the Master's bidding
BTS He was realising his own meaning in the world
BTS one of the men bellowed in his ear shaking him roughly
BTS I will I will Dr
BTS The others betrayed a well-mannered interest and urged Ernest for a statement of his views
BTS The insurance companies know
BTS Cooky's sharpening his knife for Hump was being whispered about among the sailors and some of them twitted him about it
BTS But her fingers closed on mine
BTS If modern man's producing power is a thousand times greater than that of the cave-man why then in the United States to-day are there fifteen million people who are not properly sheltered and properly fed
BTS This herding movement was practically a failure thanks to the splendid work of the comrades
BTS Johansen
BTS And so it went
BTS Power will be the arbiter as it always has been the arbiter
BTS The next moment I knew how it had happened
BTS It was fair-sized firm and unpeeled
BTS I leaned despairingly over the rail watching the trim little schooner swiftly increasing the bleak sweep of ocean between us
BTS and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe fearful that Buck and Spitz were at it
BTS Even in the daylight he did not dare leave the fire to chop fresh wood
BTS And he knew it in the old familiar way as a sound heard before
BTS That's what I say Matt answered
BTS CHAPTER XXX No wonder we called it Endeavour Island
BTS Buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled
BTS You leave Oofty alone
BTS Wickson broke in to demand
BTS He did not mind the hunger so much but the lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever-pitch
BTS And yet he found time in which to love me and make me happy
BTS Far from it
BTS That is why I cannot work in the shop
BTS I don't think
BTS I knew the kind so thick and so close of texture that it could resist the rain and not be soaked through after hours of wetting
BTS There was no place for Buck save at the front
BTS You've found your legs with a vengeance
BTS many great factories were standing idle against the time when the surplus should be gone
BTS I think and think and I cannot cease from thinking
BTS I was strangely exalted another being in another life
BTS The amusing part of it is that the funds of the insurance companies were frequently plundered and wasted by the very officials who were intrusted with the management of them
BTS They bought nothing
BTS And these perilous contacts from all these strange hands he must endure
BTS But she did not kill Donnelly
BTS Each day this remnant of the pack dwindled
BTS I felt strangely light as I came on deck as though a weight had been lifted off my shoulders
BTS Everhard and eleven others among whom were Theodore Donnelson and Matthew Kent received life imprisonment
BTS A hundred yards ahead the path turned and sloped steeply into the main street
BTS The whip was whistling savagely when once more Mercedes interfered
BTS God
BTS A cuff from the master and a sharp word had then compelled him to permit their caresses though he growled and growled under their tiny hands and in the growl there was no crooning note
BTS again
BTS In the meantime he would wait and see
BTS CHAPTER V THE SLEEPING WOLF It was about this time that the newspapers were full of the daring escape of a convict from San Quentin prison
BTS They were appalled by inaction and by the feel of something terrible impending
BTS He was even gorged from his latest kill
BTS Stand by
BTS And what were we to do
BTS What was happening in the cities of the labor castes and Mercenaries
BTS As a revolutionist myself as one on the inside who knew the hopes and fears and secret plans of the revolutionists I am fitted to answer as very few are the charge that they were guilty of exploding the bomb in Congress
BTS Larger older and stronger Lip-lip had selected White Fang for his special object of persecution
BTS But in the past you have eaten more than I have
BTS Second the organizing of the Fighting Groups and outside of them of the general secret organization of the Revolution
BTS Sons of the one mother though they were they were as different as day and night
BTS And when at last he was dragged shrieking away I sank down fainting upon the floor
BTS You must go through life seeking that flaw and remaining metaphysically silent until you have found it
BTS The figures have been gathered and it has been proved conclusively that accidents rarely occur in the first hours of the morning work but that they increase rapidly in the succeeding hours as the workers grow tired and slower in both their muscular and mental processes
BTS They'd never iv made the land sir I'm thinkin'
BTS I'll wager the Oligarchy finds justification Ernest said when its treachery to the German Emperor became known
BTS The fact that this act and thousands of similar acts went unpunished goes to show how completely the judiciary was the creature of the Plutocracy
BTS The people of the abyss were tormented out of their apathy
BTS Not by reasoning not by the five senses alone but by other and remoter and uncharted senses came the feeling to White Fang that the man was ominous with evil pregnant with hurtfulness and therefore a thing bad and wisely to be hated
BTS What had happened to him we could not imagine
BTS How we bathed our poor bodies in its delicious warmth reviving like bugs and crawling things after a storm
BTS Her hand leapt out at once to mine
BTS They had seen other sleds depart over the Pass for Dawson or come in from Dawson but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs
BTS It's going to be hell there
BTS Of course much grumbling went on and little outbursts were continually occurring
BTS It did not seem possible that any living creature could thus beard Wolf Larsen in his teeth
BTS You cannot steer night and day and for ever
BTS She finished the concluding stanza without faltering and then slowly guided the conversation into less perilous channels
BTS But suddenly with remarkable swiftness Lip-lip leaped in delivering a slashing snap and leaped away again
BTS How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment
BTS It wasn't an agreeable task for him
BTS There is the word
BTS The boat slewed around
BTS She caught her breath and stammered I I thought I was given to understand that Yokohama was only a day's sail away
BTS That was all
BTS Little did I dream the fateful part Jackson's arm was to play in my life
BTS he demanded bluntly
BTS Got to take a gamble
BTS It's ben fifty below for two weeks now
BTS It was a long time before the cub left its shelter
BTS A puff had caught the schooner and he was forced to put the wheel up rapidly to keep her out of the wind
BTS Bitter rage was his but never blind rage
BTS The man you drove from Eden's grove Was I my Lord was I And I shall be there when the earth and the air Are rent from sea to sky
BTS I do not believe in hell-fire and brimstone
BTS but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing Billee and drove him to the confines of the camp
BTS I shouted up to Latimer
BTS Two hours of terrible work followed in which all hands of us two hunters three sailors Wolf Larsen and I reefed first one and then the other the jib and mainsail
BTS The third day we spent in the building and on the fourth Ernest having got permission and an automobile from the authorities we left Chicago
BTS What if I forbid you
BTS It was at this moment that Leach and Johnson looked up into the faces of their shipmates who lined the rail amidships
BTS The trouble arose first with the Grangers in the various states they had captured at the last election
BTS There was a tremendous snarling and spitting and screeching
BTS Here the train was halted
BTS Slowly the butt descended the several intervening inches at the same time slightly twisting again
BTS I could not allow myself to forget for an instant so automatically imperative had become the new personality I had created
BTS That surely is bad doctrine I cried
BTS Then he turned deliberately and took the right fork
BTS Then he was a masterful dog and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery
BTS At any rate it was glorious
BTS McCready and Swanson
BTS I just counted
BTS They were ordinary unsuspecting dogs
BTS And north we travelled with it ravaging and destroying flinging the naked carcasses to the shark and salting down the skins so that they might later adorn the fair shoulders of the women of the cities
BTS er quarrelsome and harsh measures are necessary
BTS That White Fang should quickly gain this post was inevitable
BTS All my work had been for nothing
BTS The average dog was accustomed to the preliminaries of snarling and bristling and growling and the average dog was knocked off his feet and finished before he had begun to fight or recovered from his surprise
BTS But it can scarcely be said that White Fang was a member of the gang
BTS His desire to kill strengthened with the days and he cherished hungry ambitions for the squirrel that chattered so volubly and always informed all wild creatures that the wolf-cub was approaching
BTS Even grown dogs might hurtle him backward or sideways with the impact of their heavy bodies
BTS This he resented and when she stood shoulder to shoulder with him bristling and showing her teeth the aspiring solitary ones would back off turn-tail and continue on their lonely way
BTS Hearst persisted
BTS But when the butt of the topmast was level with the rail everything came to a standstill
BTS The labor castes the Mercenaries and the great hordes of secret agents and police of various sorts were all pledged to the Oligarchy
BTS The dreaded white god was not there
BTS Get up now
BTS But now it was different
BTS he wailed
BTS This puzzled him
BTS So Omar so I so you even you for you rebelled against dying when Cooky sharpened a knife for you
BTS Not that Buck reasoned it out
BTS White Fang sensed the coming calamity even before there was tangible evidence of it
BTS They move in order to eat in order that they may keep moving
BTS They were short of weight and in poor condition when they made Dawson and should have had a ten days' or a week's rest at least
BTS You are not going to
BTS but the food had come too late for her
BTS There were times when several dogs pitching on to him punished him before he could get away
BTS There was a burgeoning within him of strange feelings and unwonted impulses
BTS Good for little else than dish-washing and scullion work
BTS Ernest always overworked
BTS Anaesthesia as a mode of compulsory death was not introduced until later
BTS The Oligarchy stood in the way
BTS He named the points of their illogic
BTS We are saved I said soberly and solemnly
BTS You prefer to play atavistic roles
BTS It was now a variegated wall composed of the trees that fringed the stream the opposing mountain that towered above the trees and the sky that out-towered the mountain
BTS When you testified at the trial you didn't point out that Jackson received his accident through trying to save the machinery from damage
BTS I could see a large black number on one of its sails and I had seen pictures of pilot-boats
BTS I never realized before how many words could be spoken in three short hours
BTS Wolf Larsen had sat about listening to my repairing the windlass and talking with Maud and me upon indifferent subjects
BTS I won't say they was all dogs but there was seven of 'm that got fish
BTS If it didn't tangle so dreadfully she laughed
BTS When they came opposite our stern Wolf Larsen greeted them with a wave of the hand and cried Come on board and have a 'gam'
BTS I gave one fish to each dog an' Henry I was one fish short
BTS The revolutionists maintained schools of acting in all their refuges
BTS I trusted my life to it
BTS I looked at her closely and tried her with one of our signals
BTS There are several copies of various editions in the National Library of Ardis
BTS You've sold out the cause of labor of all labor
BTS I went once to his church
BTS They did not succeed and they were very stupid
BTS A companionship did exist between White Fang and the other dogs but it was one of warfare and enmity
BTS My name is Johnson not Yonson he said in very good though slow English with no more than a shade of accent to it
BTS Time was flying and they should have been on the trail an hour gone
BTS We worked in silence
BTS Weedon Scott bent over removed the arm and turned the man's face upward
BTS You and I are just like them
BTS He ate his share of meat as rapidly as he could
BTS He dared not risk a fight with this young lightning-flash and again he knew and more bitterly the enfeeblement of oncoming age
BTS It seemed monstrous impossible that our whole society was based upon blood
BTS Should Jackson have received damages
BTS Must a' butted clean through it b'gosh
BTS You cannot answer
BTS Now that the terrible unknown had let go of him he forgot that the unknown had any terrors
BTS But they hastened it by overfeeding bringing the day nearer when underfeeding would commence
BTS One may see the soul stir in some men's eyes but his were bleak and cold and grey as the sea itself
BTS For a time the man-animals continued to make their mouth-noises
BTS White Fang had seen the camp-dogs toiling in the harness so that he did not resent overmuch the first placing of the harness upon himself
BTS But Collie did not give over as was her wont after a decent interval of chastisement
BTS Upon that he was resolved
BTS The overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead Buck and his mates struggling frantically under the rain of blows
BTS under British rule in India
BTS the master commanded when he had ascertained his injury
BTS I've thought about it off and on while not wanting to think of it
BTS My ribs kicked loose from my back again
BTS The Trust was in control
BTS He don't like the old man no more nor you or me
BTS I wished merely to prepare you for the worst if the worst is to come
BTS Buck staggered over against the sled exhausted sobbing for breath helpless
BTS I walk always now he said and a blush was on his cheek at the thought of the time when he rode in his carriage as though it were a sin not lightly to be laid
BTS Had the cub thought in man-fashion he might have epitomised life as a voracious appetite and the world as a place wherein ranged a multitude of appetites pursuing and being pursued hunting and being hunted eating and being eaten all in blindness and confusion with violence and disorder a chaos of gluttony and slaughter ruled over by chance merciless planless endless
BTS When the man brought him water he drank eagerly and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat chunk by chunk from the man's hand
BTS Heads nodded around the table in affirmation
BTS the dog-musher exclaimed at supper one night
BTS The months passed by
BTS The end is in sight
BTS It's my dog Hal replied wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back
BTS As he leaned there he ran a calm and speculative eye over us as though to determine the precise point of the collision and took no notice whatever when our pilot white with rage shouted Now you've done it
BTS Immediately I classified him--a sort of prodigy I thought a Blind Tom of the working class
BTS Oh believe me we had many comforts
BTS So he patiently went the round of the publishing houses
BTS The Grangers were powerless
BTS What chance had I
BTS His nose and tongue still hurt but he was perplexed by a greater trouble
BTS I felt over and under his blankets
BTS White Fang did not need the encouragement
BTS but a side-flick of the tail sank sharp quills into it as it was withdrawn
BTS ' 'Section Seven that any officer or enlisted man'--remember Section One gentlemen you are all enlisted men--'that any enlisted man of the militia who shall refuse or neglect to present himself to such mustering officer upon being called forth as herein prescribed shall be subject to trial by court martial and shall be punished as such court martial shall direct
BTS We haven't yet penetrated that far so we couldn't escape being kept in the dark
BTS The only way out was between the two tepees and this the boy guarded
BTS We were to see much of the Black Hundreds as the days went by
BTS I was surprised and joyfully that she was so much the woman and the display of each trait and mannerism that was characteristically feminine gave me keener joy
BTS And still remain the surpluses
BTS There was no room in their theoretical social evolution for an oligarchy therefore the Oligarchy could not be
BTS Yes he is I said sliding out of the bunk and striving my hardest to keep my voice steady and bold
BTS Next we went over a low oak-covered ridge and descended into a smaller meadow
BTS He is greatly disgusted with the outlook and I am given to understand that Wolf Larsen bears a very unsavoury reputation among the sealing captains
BTS Something like that she confessed
BTS Slowly it shifted up along the jugular
BTS he demanded of Harrison
BTS When the steamboat arrived at Dawson White Fang went ashore
BTS I lay back against Ernest in the automobile and with apathetic eyes watched the soldiers trying to get the machine out of the city
BTS but there was no friendliness of intercourse displayed on either side no gladness at meeting no desire to return to the pack-formation
BTS They were a new kind of men to Buck of which he was destined to see many more and while he developed no affection for them he none the less grew honestly to respect them
BTS She was a pretty sight leaping and flying toward us and evidently bound to pass at close range
BTS But Ernest's glance took me in and questioned impatiently past and around the room
BTS I expostulated you advance the fact that it is your ship as though it were a moral right
BTS When he felt him grasp his tail Buck headed for the bank swimming with all his splendid strength
BTS His jaws closed on the hand nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once more
BTS His teeth in passing burst the wall of the great vein of the throat
BTS The book is a good example of what Everhard would have called bourgeois thinking
BTS Buck remembered the man in the red sweater and retreated slowly
BTS But the man had turned and was walking rapidly away
BTS In the United States to-day in spite of all your so-called labor legislation there are three millions of child laborers
BTS That's all right all right Parsons spoke up
BTS By sheer compulsion of personality he commanded silence
BTS But he insisted on his own privacy and self-seclusion and so thoroughly ignored Dick that that good-natured creature finally gave him up and scarcely took as much interest in him as in the hitching-post near the stable
BTS 'Who steals my purse steals trash' she quoted
BTS I began to tremble
BTS he demanded with a recrudescence of fierceness
BTS The street-car strike in San Francisco had been broken
BTS Perhaps also it was the elemental simplicity of his mind that baffled me
BTS White Fang's tongue went out he knew not why and he licked the puppy's face
BTS I thought
BTS Then is it not irrational to destroy that cheap and efficient combination
BTS The four winds had been loosed
BTS Forgotten save once when old One Eye stopped for a moment to lick his stiffening wounds
BTS And in that moment I knew that I loved him and that I was melting with desire to comfort him
BTS but he was a long time regaining his former position where he hung a pitiable object
BTS How could it be otherwise
BTS for the memory of them is forgotten
BTS Ferry-boat
BTS So that was the way
BTS Then the god spoke and at the first sound of his voice the hair rose on White Fang's neck and the growl rushed up in his throat
BTS They were soft and helpless made much noise and floundered around clumsily trying to accomplish by main strength what he accomplished by dexterity and cunning
BTS Then there was no movement
BTS We ran down the flying jib hauled the jib-sheets to wind-ward and the main-sheet flat and came up into the wind
BTS Something might happen
BTS As clearly as in the light of past events he saw the defection of the favored unions the rise and the slow decay of the labor castes and the struggle between the decaying oligarchs and labor castes for control of the great governmental machine
BTS So I lowered the big starboard anchor giving plenty of slack
BTS Three oilers and a fourth engineer was his greeting
BTS a laugh that was as rough and harsh and frank as the sea itself
BTS while no man not a member of the favored unions was permitted to carry weapons
BTS The rest of you tail aft to the mainsheet
BTS The machine stopped for a moment just abreast of us
BTS Never did he fail to respond savagely to the chatter of the squirrel he had first met on the blasted pine
BTS The shark was not in the reckoning
BTS My health is better for it he added hastily
BTS Two other balloons followed at the same time
BTS It had stopped and the master was alighting
BTS Numbers of the farmers impelled by an insane lust for the soil and willing to show what beasts they could become tried to escape expropriation by withdrawing from any and all market-dealing
BTS I remembered her Good-night Humphrey
BTS and twice for short periods we had been hove to
BTS It's all right he repeated
BTS A part-grown puppy somewhat larger and older than he came toward him slowly with ostentatious and belligerent importance
BTS This time though we were continually half-buried there was no trough in which to be swept and we drifted squarely down upon the upturned boat badly smashing it as it was heaved inboard
BTS He was but two paces behind when I tumbled into the boat and as I shoved off with an oar his teeth crunched down upon the blade
BTS Bibles and Prayer-books seemed scarce articles but one of the men volunteered to pursue the quest amongst the watch below returning in a minute with the information that there was none
BTS But they'll work
BTS I could have wept myself
BTS It was cold and he gasped breathing quickly
BTS This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun that there is one event unto all
BTS It was to the death
BTS This time Wolf Larsen's command was thrillingly imperative
BTS He is a free spirit
BTS Well you'll know all right when we pull into McGurry
BTS When his mother was absent he slept most of the time while during the intervals that he was awake he kept very quiet suppressing the whimpering cries that tickled in his throat and strove for noise
BTS It is not the law
BTS With a long running-line coiled down in the stem I rowed well out into our little cove and dropped the anchor into the water
BTS The dogs that still lived looked on and understood
BTS With one accord all eyes left the plates and settled on her
BTS Our complaints were useless
BTS While she accepted him because it was the mandate of the gods that was no reason that she should leave him in peace
BTS then he suppressed the whimper for fear that it might attract the attention of the lurking dangers
BTS I scarcely know where to begin
BTS He is my dog
BTS And with the exception of a solitary man no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known as College Park
BTS I can't believe it I cried
BTS His face was serious
BTS It's a shame after working hard all day that we cannot have an uninterrupted night's sleep I complained after supper
BTS What he foresaw was the defection of the great labor unions and the rise of the castes
BTS In short Beauty Smith was a monstrosity and the blame of it lay elsewhere
BTS Philosophy is the science of science the master science if you please
BTS Van Weyden he said
BTS This seemed to satisfy his master who flung him down roughly in the bottom of the canoe
BTS Possibly in her whole life it was the most terrible snarl she ever gave
BTS I shook my head saying Something has happened to him
BTS Another time he dropped a steel marlinspike from the mizzen crosstree
BTS Also he stood less in fear of them than formerly stalking among them with a certain careless ease that was as new to him as it was enjoyable
BTS It was in the summer that White Fang arrived at Fort Yukon
BTS Such was the impression of strength I gathered from this man who paced up and down
BTS To-morrow I shall pay for it as the drunkard pays
BTS Of course I couldn't accept it under the circumstances
BTS He leaped a ditch went through a rail fence and fled across a field
BTS For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank and during those two days and nights of torment he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him
BTS It was the quality that was peculiarly the possession of his kind
BTS 'Oo I s'y
BTS When he was half-way out the Ghost took a long roll to windward and back again into the hollow between two seas
BTS He did not like to be approached on his blind side
BTS He was especially delighted because his discharge had been precipitated by the publication of his book Economics and Education
BTS She had never forgiven him the chicken-killing episode and persistently held to the belief that his intentions were bad
BTS What is the matter
BTS I had learned nothing but theories of life and society that looked all very well on the printed page but now I had seen life itself
BTS Maybe the man was insolent
BTS And she knew it
BTS Then added with the whimsical smile I adored but I am only one small woman
BTS Now by Gar I feex you
BTS This was a sort of victory for Thomas Mugridge and enabled him to accept more gracefully the defeat I had given him though of course he was too discreet to attempt to drive the hunters away
BTS You wear the warm clothes
BTS and for a long time he clung to his precarious perch without attempting to move
BTS I came upon it abruptly as a wanderer in the country would come upon a flowing stream
BTS But why is it policy
BTS 'E cawn't live as long as me
BTS Round and round he went whirling and turning and reversing trying to shake off the fifty-pound weight that dragged at his throat
BTS 'Ow could it I s'y
BTS White Fang resisted and he could feel the jaws shifting their grip slightly relaxing and coming together again in a chewing movement
BTS He waited
BTS It was a few miles up a small stream that in the summer time flowed into the Mackenzie but that then was frozen over and frozen down to its rocky bottom a dead stream of solid white from source to mouth
BTS It was impossible for one uninformed to escape the vague yet certain feeling that all the land was ripe for the revolt that had already begun to break out
BTS And mind you it's for your own soul's sake
BTS Value
BTS He began in a low voice haltingly and modestly and with an air of evident embarrassment
BTS It smote Miss Brewster likewise a vague and nameless terror rushing into her eyes as she regarded Wolf Larsen
BTS He saw once for all that he stood no chance against a man with a club
BTS I seemed to know just what to do and how to do it
BTS But the boss doesn't know that she added quickly betraying a fear of getting him into trouble
BTS Wherever there was trouble and uproar in camp fighting and squabbling or the outcry of a squaw over a bit of stolen meat they were sure to find White Fang mixed up in it and usually at the bottom of it
BTS In some way he must have escaped
BTS Yes Ernest answered precisely that
BTS You have no fictions no dreams no ideals
BTS Ardis was completed in 1942 A
BTS Clear that raffle I answered pointing to the tangled wreckage overside
BTS This task fell to Biedenbach and slung on a rope from above he toiled cunningly for the rest of the day till no sign remained
BTS Nor is it in your power even to make it stand still
BTS was his retort
BTS They would serve as roof-beams
BTS I could not play the coward before her eyes
BTS I was seeing the other side of the shield
BTS He inspected the grass beneath him the moss-berry plant just beyond and the dead trunk of the blasted pine that stood on the edge of an open space among the trees
BTS I have faint memories of breaking a window and hiding in some shop to escape a street mob that was pursued by soldiers
BTS But it fitted
BTS But so many were the men who had rushed into the Klondike and so many were the sweethearts wives and kin that had not rushed in that the congested mail was taking on Alpine proportions
BTS Not at all
BTS There's no one to stop you
BTS Hammerfield gasped and managed to answer The best of us may be mistaken young man the best of us
BTS Several times I collided against hard objects once striking my right knee a terrible blow
BTS Why you who live on the land know that you house your poor people in the slums of cities and loose famine and pestilence upon them and that there still remain more poor people dying for want of a crust of bread and a bit of meat which is life destroyed than you know what to do with
BTS He encountered a feathered whirlwind
BTS At the break of the poop he reeled raised one hand to his eyes with the familiar brushing gesture and fell down the steps still on his feet to the main deck across which he staggered falling and flinging out his arms for support
BTS The business of love was at hand ever a sterner and crueller business than that of food-getting
BTS Once off his feet and under that mass of huskies there was no hope for him
BTS The upshot of the affair was that she accompanied me next morning
BTS Sail had been made in the early watches so that the Ghost was racing along under everything except the two topsails and the flying jib
BTS Oh it hasn't subsidized all of the unions
BTS They sowed wind and wind and ever more wind
BTS Now you red-eyed devil he said when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of Buck's body
BTS He accepted Destiny marched hand in hand with it and coolly measured the stroke
BTS He was quivering to it
BTS Fool
BTS I asked with a helpless shrug
BTS And the possessors were not of the idle rich
BTS The Sunland was very dim and distant and such memories had no power over him
BTS Scott cried out through the darkness
BTS And so far as your stupidity is concerned you are but the exemplar of your class
BTS And woe to the dog that at such times ran foul of him
BTS Kiche's greeting of her grown son was anything but affectionate
BTS Without warning the love-master disappeared
BTS And at once as in an instant's leap the sun was blotted out there was no sky even our mastheads were lost to view and our horizon was such as tear-blinded eyes may see
BTS Buck sprang upon Sol-leks in a fury driving him back and standing in his place
BTS Hardly had the carriage entered the grounds when he was set upon by a sheep-dog bright-eyed sharp-muzzled righteously indignant and angry
BTS White Fang's suspicious eyes followed every movement
BTS Every little while flurries like this occurred each flurry culminating in the revolver shot that put an end to it
BTS It might have been Grecian it might have been Roman only it was a shade too massive for the one a shade too delicate for the other
BTS Smoke ho
BTS Ah the decisiveness the very sound of the words was good in my ears
BTS Thenceforth in the nature of things he would possess an abiding distrust of appearances
BTS Its forty feet of length would supply the height necessary properly to swing the mast
BTS I saw the other one run off across the snow Bill announced with cool positiveness
BTS The god's hand had come out and was descending upon his head
BTS And now that we had Wolf Larsen in irons how little did we need it
BTS After that he recoiled from hurt because he knew that it was hurt
BTS It was directly above him
BTS Occasionally the wires were up and he spoke as well as ever though slowly and heavily
BTS The tongues of all were out and lolling the white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight
BTS In the morning the door opened and Matt stepped outside
BTS Charles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance
BTS Go away
BTS But he was very sick
BTS It did not take long
BTS Here he was compelled to violate his instinct of self-preservation and violate it he did for he was becoming tame and qualifying himself for civilisation
BTS That's their way
BTS This glimpse I had caught of his other side must have emboldened me for I resolved to speak to him about the money I had lost
BTS The table was not cleared
BTS Still hidden amongst the trees he paused to study the situation
BTS Was he too destined for a cross
BTS Revenge was the ruling motive and the members of the terroristic organizations were careless of their own lives and hopeless about the future
BTS He leaned out of the door
BTS Johnson was a splendid seaman and he knew as much about small boats as he did about ships
BTS But with the master the cuff was always too light to hurt the flesh
BTS You have forgotten the editors
BTS and the curse of it is that I must lie here conscious mentally unimpaired knowing that the lines are going down breaking bit by bit communication with the world
BTS In the suburbs the morning papers came on board the train
BTS His mother represented power
BTS It was a quiet moonlight night but I tossed restlessly and could not sleep
BTS and yet again in his very walk there seemed that suggestion of weakness and indecision
BTS Buck was the exception
BTS Time and again the impulse surged over White Fang and each time as he yielded to it he was checked by the master's voice
BTS The Rockefeller bank--the National City Bank--is by itself far and away the biggest bank in the United States
BTS Something suspiciously akin to moistness dimmed her beautiful eyes before she dropped them and partly turned away her head
BTS Nope
BTS Beyond is the cemetery--long winding galleries hewn out of the solid rock with recesses on either hand wherein tier above tier lie the revolutionists just as they were laid away by their comrades long years agone
BTS His face was anxious as was the face of my companion who had stumped over to the rail and was gazing with a like intentness in the direction of the invisible danger
BTS Besides his hands were full with his sister or his arms rather
BTS Also Dr
BTS He should a-got the damages
BTS Week by week more of the socialist papers were barred from the mails and in a number of instances the Black Hundreds destroyed the socialist presses
BTS This accomplished he cruised back and forth across what he knew must be their course
BTS They were the most terrible of all
BTS but Grey Beaver did not caress nor speak kind words
BTS Orders were being given to clear the wheels of the war-machines
BTS A moment later he was inside the house and the slaughter began
BTS Maud tried to reply but could not speak
BTS At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front
BTS I asked
BTS he cried
BTS A flight of quail thrummed off through the thickets
BTS Nor did he know the desperateness of her deed
BTS Johnson I corrected and reached out my hand for his
BTS The oligarchs believed their ethics in spite of the fact that biology and evolution gave them the lie
BTS The months went by
BTS I'll wager every man Jack of them is over the side to-morrow hunting for Wolf Larsen as contentedly as ever they hunted for Death Larsen
BTS The astounding thing about it was that they refused in almost identically the same language and this in face of the fact that I interviewed them separately and that one did not know that I had seen or was going to see the other
BTS The man you drove from Eden's grove Was I my Lord was I And I shall be there when the earth and the air Are rent from sea to sky
BTS You know that
BTS At five in the morning I dressed and abandoned my bed
BTS With the exception of a few of the musicians and singers and of a few of the oligarchs all the great creators of the period whose names have come down to us were revolutionists
BTS The grip was the thing and the grip he kept
BTS is the test
BTS Big words he smiled
BTS The Wolf I said the Wolf
BTS But he was caught in the machine and worked to death--for profit
BTS I think I'll sit down
BTS Time and again and many times he ranged the horse up to the gate in the effort to close it and each time the horse became frightened and backed and plunged away
BTS What I need is a longer club
BTS Why don't you shoot
BTS He came to a stop and blinked across at White Fang
BTS CHAPTER XVII Strange to say in spite of the general foreboding nothing of especial moment happened on the Ghost
BTS This day was the very day of the explosion
BTS After that he will be left to gibber his visions to padded walls
BTS His cigar went out and he continued to gaze silently and curiously
BTS But he must have recovered himself quickly for the cab hadn't gone fifty feet before it turned around and came back
BTS There was momentum in the twentieth century while there was practically none in ancient Rome
BTS Night had fallen when we made our first change of engine and I walked down the platform for a breath of fresh air and to see what I could see
BTS If he had been a gliding shadow before he now became the ghost of such a shadow as he crept and circled around and came up well to leeward of the silent motionless pair
BTS Though like Everhard they did not dream of the nature of it there were men even before his time who caught glimpses of the shadow
BTS Symptoms I said
BTS Small wonder that I am restless
BTS I struck him with my fist on the face as he raised his head but it was a puny blow
BTS and at the sound of his voice the whole circle was agitated there was a general snarl and the she-wolf slid up close to him across the snow and watched him with hungry wistfulness
BTS but the Cockney was desperately melancholy and I was aware of a great sympathy for the unfortunate creature
BTS It's all right for you 'Ump
BTS Inoffensive ranchers in remote valleys were held up by armed men and compelled to identify themselves
BTS Furthermore the revolutionary parties in all countries gave public utterance to the socialist principle of international peace that must be preserved at all hazards even to the extent of revolt and revolution at home
BTS This delicate aristocratic-featured gentleman was a dummy director and a tool of corporations that secretly robbed widows and orphans
BTS Your claws are trimmed
BTS Go 'way Chook
BTS Go
BTS and though it was a mild night on the sea there was a continual chorus of the creaking timbers and bulkheads and of abysmal noises beneath the flooring
BTS The Great Earthquake of 2368 A
BTS Wolf Larsen had been quite right
BTS The troops operated on the basis that no man not an outlaw remained in the mountains
BTS Even the grim south-western promontory showed less grim and here and there where the sea-spray wet its surface high lights flashed and dazzled in the sun
BTS My father and mother were Danes and how they ever came to that bleak bight of land on the west coast I do not know
BTS Galvin shook his head
BTS Here was the ancient marauder up to his old tricks again
BTS This was the world the universe itself its bounds so near one felt impelled to reach out both arms and push them back
BTS There must have been laughter in hell at the spectacle
BTS He confessed that he never made any profits out of his quarry and this in spite of the enormous volume of business that had been caused by the destruction of San Francisco by the big earthquake
BTS I'm afraid some one else has fed me most of my life she laughed trying bravely to enter into the spirit of his quizzing though I could see a terror dawning and growing in her eyes as she watched Wolf Larsen
BTS the great mass of the people still persisted in the belief that they ruled the country by virtue of their ballots
BTS The deserted boat was in the trough of the sea rolling drunkenly across each comber its loose spritsail out at right angles to it and fluttering and flapping in the wind
BTS They could not continue their method of producing surpluses
BTS That Hal's views on art or the sort of society plays his mother's brother wrote should have anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood passes comprehension
BTS N-no she considered
BTS The oligarchs had succeeded in devising a governmental machine as intricate as it was vast that worked--and this despite all our efforts to clog and hamper
BTS But you should penalise father too interpose Beth
BTS Millions of people were starving while the oligarchs and their supporters were surfeiting on the surplus
BTS He tugged harder
BTS and by the time she joined me I had finished the slaughter and was beginning to skin
BTS All things are relative
BTS Yet again in this new orientation it was the thumb of circumstance that pressed and prodded him softening that which had become hard and remoulding it into fairer form
BTS There will be more of it
BTS Buck was wildly glad
BTS The nails were discoloured and black while the skin was already grained with dirt which even a scrubbing-brush could not remove
BTS But I did not yet have the harsh facts of life at my fingers' ends as Ernest had
BTS This gentleman who collected fine editions and was a patron of literature paid blackmail to a heavy-jowled black-browed boss of a municipal machine
BTS The porcupine had at last decided that its enemy had gone away
BTS In our loins are the possibilities of millions of lives
BTS an' then some
BTS and why should I not fill my eyes with that which pleases me
BTS He must be nursed as you would nurse a human being a sick child
BTS Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed skyward by the unwonted demand it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal
BTS All this was the manifestation of power
BTS Back from the lip of the hole where ended the young man's obliterated trial Carlson put on the shoes and walked away to the left
BTS I just thought you might want to register a kick
BTS They could hardly have fared worse
BTS The information is quite correct I answered
BTS It was an improved crank windlass and the purchase it gave was enormous
BTS All went well until I aimed a blow at an outlying cow's head and fell short
BTS It is a ludicrous spectacle to us but we must not forget that we have seven centuries' advantage over those that lived in that time
BTS So he ate the ptarmigan
BTS Then he saw that no harm befell the dogs that were near to them and he came in closer
BTS He was challenging my manhood with his slurs challenging the very legs he claimed to be instrumental in getting for me
BTS Larsen I heard a muffled voice from within the mass
BTS Without haste with the air of one resigned to misfortune Bill turned his head and from where he sat counted the dogs
BTS Something was wrong inside but they could locate no broken bones could not make it out
BTS He would advance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching movement when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for a few more inches
BTS It was only by the severest muscular exertion and neck-arching that he succeeded in getting the wood between his teeth and barely between his teeth at that
BTS And certainly it was he that caused the mother the most trouble in keeping her litter from the mouth of the cave
BTS Here is what is going to happen
BTS Johnson Wolf Larsen said with an air of dismissing all that had gone before as introductory to the main business in hand I understand you're not quite satisfied with those oilskins
BTS The clubs fell upon them unheeded
BTS As he neared her he became suddenly cautious
BTS And when released he sprang to his feet his mouth laughing his eyes eloquent his throat vibrant with unuttered sound and in that fashion remained without movement John Thornton would reverently exclaim God
BTS Both went down together but Mugridge alone arose
BTS A tingle of excitement ran along the air
BTS Give 'm hell you wolf
BTS He drew attention to me
BTS She was too unused as yet to the whims of the man to accept them with equanimity
BTS Any jackass gets aboard one and runs it from hell to breakfast blowin' his whistle to beat the band and tellin' the rest of the world to look out for him because he's comin' and can't look out for himself
BTS There will be violence and murder now and sorrowing widows and orphans
BTS Nothing could destroy its exquisite oval its well-nigh classic lines its delicately stencilled brows its large brown eyes clear-seeing and calm gloriously calm
BTS In its frozen state it was more like strips of galvanized iron and when a dog wrestled it into his stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious leathery strings and into a mass of short hair irritating and indigestible
BTS Values were pitifully and inconceivably shrunken and the trusts added hugely to their holdings even extending their enterprises into many new fields--and always at the expense of the middle class
BTS His wild flight ceased abruptly
BTS others were long-legged too long
BTS Whatever they have done they have been hounded into doing
BTS Surely it is a waste of time to elaborate these A B C's of commerce Mr
BTS she cried
BTS cried Mercedes throwing up her hands in dainty dismay
BTS He was the one little grey cub of the litter
BTS Hump he said becoming cognizant of the fascinated gaze I bent upon him this beats whisky and is where your Omar misses
BTS So it would seem Three Eagles Grey Beaver answered laying his hand on the cub
BTS From these experiences he became suspicious of all children
BTS Bill seemed to have forgotten his forebodings of the previous night and even waxed facetious with the dogs when at midday they overturned the sled on a bad piece of trail
BTS From the bull's side just forward of the flank protruded a feathered arrow-end which accounted for his savageness
BTS We are in power
BTS The dogs were drawn apart the bull-dog struggling vigorously
BTS ' She made me an elaborate and stately courtesy and said As for you sir  And yet through the five minutes of banter which followed there was a serious something underneath the fun which I could not but relate to the strange and fleeting expression I had caught in her eyes
BTS Ain't thinkin' it'll hurt my digestion
BTS Like sea-sickness I suppose
BTS ' Father paused
BTS He had to be taken into account that was all
BTS All his weight was on one foot and he was in a state of unstable equilibrium
BTS Because he's worth twenty thousand dollars a year to them that's what for
BTS A moment later he had dived under the boat seized the keel in his mouth and was shaking the boat violently
BTS Billee terrified into bravery sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the ice
BTS The hunters possibly no more than tolerated me though none of them disliked me
BTS What d'ye say
BTS When the train stopped at Sixteenth Street Station in Oakland we alighted and there Felice Van Verdighan with her two maids her lap-dog and her lap-dog's maid disappeared forever
BTS His gaze and his hand-clasp grew firmer and steadier if that were possible
BTS As he rounded the house to the porte-cochere he came upon the carriage
BTS He has been attempting to curry favour and reinstate himself in the good graces of the captain by carrying tales of the men forward
BTS Mr
BTS It did not protest as to-day it does not protest
BTS Mercedes screamed cried laughed and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria
BTS I could not be so fortunate
BTS I felt that I should lose my mind and I ran up the companion stairs to open the doors and escape on deck
BTS Then it was that White Fang struck
BTS A man more courageous than ethical and of undeniable ability
BTS To man has been given the grief often of seeing his gods overthrown and his altars crumbling
BTS In his puppyhood under the persecution of Lip-lip and the puppy-pack and in his fighting days with Beauty Smith he had acquired a fixed aversion for dogs
BTS But he himself did not know anything about it
BTS The boat had lowered its sail and run alongside
BTS Buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the woman
BTS Let me show you
BTS Therefore the mind of the man is wrong
BTS And it would have gone hard with him had not Collie appeared on the scene
BTS Larsen but you must grant that the bravery is mine
BTS We can deny him that satisfaction
BTS I shall take the revolvers
BTS But there was no danger
BTS But White Fang was unaware of it
BTS In the end with loud protestations that he could lose like a gentleman the cook's last money was staked on the game and lost
BTS Conversation ceased
BTS There never was a time when there wasn't trouble when you and that brother of yours got together and I'll lay twenty to one on that
BTS We all knew that something terrible was imminent
BTS He did it in a surge of rage
BTS I am so afraid
BTS You are compelled to form a new political party because the old parties are in the hands of the trusts
BTS Regardless of his bulging muscles and prize-fighter's throat he impressed me as an ingenuous boy
BTS All right Hump he said in a low voice
BTS Two years hence every office will be ours from the President down to the local dog-catcher
BTS As usual his was the sheer materialistic side and Maud's was the idealistic
BTS I had burst open the ends of my fingers at the very first and during the reefing I had worked with tears of pain running down my cheeks
BTS He had sprung fully six feet across the deck and driven his fist into the other's stomach
BTS Then I'd show 'em what for damn 'em
BTS Often were we betrayed
BTS Instinctively he leaped into the fire and as he leaped he felt the sharp slash of teeth that tore through the flesh of his leg
BTS but they quickly became hired fighting men of the capitalists and ultimately developed into the Mercenaries of the Oligarchy
BTS The abbreviated leg looked as though the devil had there clutched for the Cockney's soul and missed the shadow for the substance
BTS He had done no wrong broken no law yet here was this boy preparing to give him a beating
BTS And it is by these A B C's I have so carefully elaborated that I shall confound you Ernest retorted
BTS and there to leeward in the troubled silver of the rising sun appeared and disappeared a black speck
BTS He watched and learned
BTS she cried
BTS But to the south-west some six hundred miles is Japan
BTS She's a-comin' I tell you and it'll be sheets and halyards stand by all hands when she begins to howl
BTS Her eyes lifted curiously to mine
BTS after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting
BTS ' Maud looked at me surprised and shocked
BTS I was able always to hear the morning and evening trains arrive and depart and I used to set my watch by the whistle at the brickyards
BTS It was as though our last stormy meeting was forgotten
BTS There was a hint just a slight hint of physical feebleness in his voice and it was so strange that I looked quickly at him
BTS He went about the deck like a tiger cub glaring his hatred openly at Wolf Larsen and Johansen
BTS I thought of that Bill answered gravely
BTS The last lines are going down
BTS Next I tried the newspapers
BTS So the dogs came to understand that when the team stopped by order White Fang was to be let alone
BTS he cried
BTS Leach and Johnson took no part in the discussion and it was plain to see that their mates looked upon them as men for whom the worst was inevitable who were beyond hope and already dead
BTS And once declared against him they found good reason to continue declared against him
BTS But this quarter of a million does not control the government though it renders yeoman service
BTS All this was secret but secrets will out
BTS Ambulances were not for such as he
BTS I cocked both barrels and levelled the shot-gun at him
BTS Clutching the woodwork of the galley for support and I confess the grease with which it was scummed put my teeth on edge I reached across a hot cooking-range to the offending utensil unhooked it and wedged it securely into the coal-box
BTS Without doubt he was on my trail for we had long since learned that my disappearance had been cause of deep concern to the secret service of the Oligarchy
BTS Tyke 'im aw'y carn't yer
BTS And they were not namby-pamby oaths or mere expressions of indecency
BTS Let us throw off all disguise and accept the truth as Mr
BTS The dog-musher made a rush of it and White Fang dodged between the legs of a group of men
BTS She buried her head on my shoulder her frail form shaken with a storm of weeping
BTS but this time his voice was gritty and metallic
BTS The wind balked my every effort ripping the canvas out of my hands and in an instant undoing what I had gained by ten minutes of severest struggle
BTS Fifty-two Congressmen were in prison and fully three hundred more of our leaders
BTS No you are too cunning for that
BTS We will break the machines
BTS Two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses into shape and the wound-stiffened team was under way struggling painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered and for that matter the hardest between them and Dawson
BTS The bell which had seemed straight ahead was now sounding from the side
BTS While he was struggling to his feet the young dog sank teeth twice into his shoulder
BTS At the end of an hour and a half he was nearly alongside standing past our stern on the last leg out aiming to fetch us on the next leg back
BTS I went through high school he replied
BTS There's no denyin' he thinks a hell of a lot of you Matt said
BTS All was unseen much was unguessed
BTS This mob had risen up out of the earth apparently and to all intents and purposes its work done it had gone back into the earth
BTS but his mouth was wide open his breast heaving as though from suffocation as he laboured noisily for breath
BTS Different from the Mackenzie toboggans were the Klondike sleds with runners under them
BTS Here the hunters stored the ammunition-boxes they carried in the boats and here but a few feet from their noisy revels I took possession of two boxes
BTS she asked him
BTS He had shielded me and received the first brunt of the attack
BTS This time the man succeeded only in partly blocking and his throat was torn open
BTS Instead of being crushed by the machines life will be made fairer and happier and nobler by them
BTS I don't care to undertake the herding of one of those harems I objected
BTS He no longer felt anything though very faintly he could hear the impact of the club upon his body
BTS I hesitated to descend
BTS Making the watch-tackle fast I hove on the windlass and brought in the mast inch by inch till its top tilted down to the deck and finally its whole length lay on the deck
BTS As the schooner paid off the fore- and main-sheets were slacked away for fair wind
BTS CHAPTER XV There was a deal of cursing and groaning as the men at the bottom of the ladder crawled to their feet
BTS Let us see
BTS Mit-sah and Kloo-kooch went with him
BTS Get your palm and needle and sew the beggar up
BTS Am I what
BTS We could never hide ourselves upon it
BTS I'm just finishing the finishing touches
BTS It was due to his whim that I was detained aboard in the first place
BTS when he remained still it remained still and he concluded it was safer to continue remaining still
BTS but in time the blood became so widely diffused that it ran in the veins practically of all Americans
BTS Still I advanced steadily looking for him to turn tail at any moment and run
BTS He was master of the situation
BTS It was brought about by a conversation in the Eldorado Saloon in which men waxed boastful of their favorite dogs
BTS It was a time of madness
BTS What do you think
BTS he is too often sad
BTS I felt myself masculine the protector of the weak the fighting male
BTS He faced the boy bristling and snarling his sense of justice outraged
BTS he cried
BTS He knew only hate and lost himself in the passion of it
BTS The land itself was a desolation lifeless without movement so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness
BTS Humphrey Van Weyden she said you are a brave man
BTS So did Mit-sah and Kloo-kooch
BTS She was without value to him
BTS He was the perfect expositor
BTS She never regained them This was what the onlooking huskies had waited for
BTS It was cowardly but what else could I do
BTS He will learn if he has a chance
BTS Nothing happened
BTS But on this trip he did not get lost
BTS The two doors slammed at the same moment and Weedon Scott waited for Matt to come around to the front
BTS I was acquiring more confidence in myself and more confidence in the possibilities of windlasses shears and hoisting tackles
BTS It reminded me of the great hoot-owl listening after its booming cry for the stir of its frightened prey
BTS This little conference in our home was unofficial
BTS He paused at the mouth of the cave with a sudden shock of suspicion
BTS This but served to make the god more wrathful
BTS Before they saw the cause the two men saw him turn and start to run back toward them
BTS But his case was deferred to next day principally for the reason that I did not know anything about broken ribs and would first have to read it up
BTS If the United States becomes too hot for us why I have qualified for citizenship in Turkey
BTS Then you'll see
BTS Can the United States do what she previously did--get rid of her surplus to Brazil
BTS I won't 'it yer
BTS The machinery of society was in the hands of those who were bent on breaking him
BTS Asmunsen said
BTS but Cherokee held on
BTS White Fang was furious
BTS I asked
BTS And break it out and walk off with it for a hundred yards John Thornton said coolly
BTS I have a dread that he will turn upon them unexpectedly some day
BTS But the trouble lay in that the wind was not strong enough nor steady enough to keep the sail full
BTS Surely he had little reason to be afraid
BTS Eh
BTS and escaped
BTS This is a dilemma that interferes somehow with the aim of creation and the only way out as it seems to you is to destroy that which takes from you your profits
BTS Owen insisted
BTS He uttered a glad little cry and bounded to meet her while the man-animals went back hastily several steps
BTS All that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by chemically propelled leaden pellets the blood lust the joy to kill all this was Buck's only it was infinitely more intimate
BTS Hammerfield's discomfiture complete
BTS I remember another street with quiet buildings on either side and the panic that smote me into consciousness as again I saw the people of the abyss but this time in a stream that flowed and came on
BTS Grab hold of something and hang on the red-faced man said to me
BTS It was only a year
BTS but at the time it was the most natural thing in the world
BTS The mob had been stopped in its wild attempt to break through
BTS Did you see that one
BTS But I think I'll leave the bulls alone next time
BTS We must have been well in the path of the trans-Pacific steamships when the typhoon moderated and here to the surprise of the hunters we found ourselves in the midst of seals a second herd or sort of rear-guard they declared and a most unusual thing
BTS You couldn't get it in if you paid ten times the regular advertising rates
BTS Then the sheet gave with greater ease and Wolf Larsen was beside me heaving in alone while I was busied taking up the slack
BTS The next moment Weedon Scott had torn loose from the embrace and closed with White Fang who had become a snarling raging demon
BTS and he won his revenge by spreading glowing reports among the hunters as to what an excellent lydy's-myde I was proving myself to be
BTS Can you explain it
BTS As Austin Lewis says speaking of that time those to whom the command 'Feed my lambs' had been given saw those lambs sold into slavery and worked to death without a protest
BTS Might be a lot of dog in 'm for all you can tell
BTS He came to know that it was not fear of him that drove the thief away but fear of Grey Beaver
BTS From then on he had risen like a rocket
BTS The tackles jammed
BTS Dave and Sol-leks dripping blood from a score of wounds were fighting bravely side by side
BTS He set to work to carry out a new idea that had come to him
BTS But still worse it seemed that his spirit was broken
BTS By the edge head and fore feet in the water lay Skeet faithful to the last
BTS I find life precarious enough in my present humble situation
BTS He has many desires
BTS The circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on his flanks
BTS He bristled and showed his teeth his eyes vigilant his whole body wary and prepared for anything
BTS The crunchin' of the bones wasn't nice was his answer
BTS Now Biedenbach after he left Glen Ellen had invented a most powerful explosive--expedite he called it
BTS Look at me
BTS He was too quick for them too formidable too wise
BTS I borrowed a whetstone from Johansen
BTS The incumbents refused to retire and the courts were in the hands of the Oligarchy
BTS I looked down at the brown glory of her hair glinting gems in the sunshine far more precious to me than those in the treasure-chests of kings
BTS And in place of the merchant class of bourgeoisie will be the labor castes
BTS Trust me it will come right
BTS I want to ask a favour Mr
BTS All that remained to be done was the drawing in of the net
BTS Sir he corrected not harshly but sternly
BTS I have seen him a score of times at table insulting this hunter or that with cool and level eyes and withal a certain air of interest pondering their actions or replies or petty rages with a curiosity almost laughable to me who stood onlooker and who understood
BTS What the devil can you do with a wolf in California
BTS They were truly representative middle-class business men
BTS But the cub saw and it was a warning and a lesson to him the swift downward swoop of the hawk the short skim of its body just above the ground the strike of its talons in the body of the ptarmigan the ptarmigan's squawk of agony and fright and the hawk's rush upward into the blue carrying the ptarmigan away with it
BTS He heard a shot then two shots in rapid succession and he knew that Bill's ammunition was gone
BTS I never could find anything when they had departed
BTS Quite so he said
BTS I was workin' overtime an' I guess I was tired out some
BTS And thus it was that I passed into a state of involuntary servitude to Wolf Larsen
BTS I looked at her
BTS Remained only the trampled snow to show how closely they had pressed him
BTS no I won't
BTS Thus we were in both camps at the same time ostensibly serving the Iron Heel and secretly working with all our might for the Cause
BTS Now what do you do
BTS In the other hand he held a bottle which from time to time was inverted above his head to the accompaniment of gurgling noises
BTS It was bewildering
BTS But you tried to prevent it
BTS You were looking squeamish this afternoon he began
BTS But suppose he desires to do two opposite things neither of which will permit him to do the other
BTS You of the destroyed middle class along with labor--there will be nothing but labor then
BTS They were doing the thing in style with fourteen dogs
BTS For our liberties we are ready to fight and die
BTS One thing about her which surprised me was her lack of timidity and fear
BTS This over he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him sniffing in half-friendly half-savage manner
BTS There are signs of rampant bad temper in the steerage and the gossip is going around that Smoke and Henderson have had a fight
BTS A quick effort brought his hands up to the halyards again
BTS Scott never desisted from his efforts though he looked up coolly and asked Your dog
BTS He was hungry and he remembered pieces of meat and fish that had been thrown him
BTS Sailing one direction drifting another direction to say nothing of the set of the current in some third direction makes a resultant which dead reckoning can never calculate
BTS The shrouds were wet with moisture
BTS When unusual needs arose for them such as the building of the great highways and air-lines of canals tunnels subways and fortifications levies were made on the labor-ghettos and tens of thousands of serfs willy-nilly were transported to the scene of operations
BTS It was well I did for it covered the boat fully a third of the way aft and three times in the next several hours it flung off the bulk of the down-rushing water when the bow shoved under the seas
BTS It was the long wolf-howl full-throated and mournful the first howl he had ever uttered
BTS The dog-musher still on his knees and stooped over White Fang calculated for a moment
BTS All hands were on deck now and all eyes were aloft where a human life was at grapples with death
BTS Then he cast an anxious look about him and said Because I've a good wife an' three of the sweetest children ye ever laid eyes on that's why
BTS I glanced over them noting with astonishment such names as Shakespeare Tennyson Poe and De Quincey
BTS Dead things did their bidding
BTS Your chest is heaving your tongue protruding your skin turning dark your eyes swimming
BTS It was the old village changed to a new place
BTS His face was white his lips were trembling
BTS They began to drop off to be brushed off against the sharp edge of the scuttle to be knocked off by the legs which were now kicking powerfully
BTS They could barely keep the traces taut and on the down grades just managed to keep out of the way of the sled
BTS As Ernest talked he seemed in a fine passion
BTS In the end the master laughed him out of his dignity
BTS If I don't get the hydrophoby  It'll be because you was born to hang laughed the saloon-keeper
BTS Bit by bit an inch at a time with here a wolf bellying forward and there a wolf bellying forward the circle would narrow until the brutes were almost within springing distance
BTS The two men were murdered
BTS A contemporary of John Stuart Mill
BTS His captain could have killed him and I doubt not that blood would have flowed had not Maud Brewster been present
BTS I was quite taken aback and before I could find myself had sillily stammered I I am a gentleman
BTS And there a century and a half ago originated the modern proletariat Ernest continued
BTS You are sure of your resurrection
BTS In quick rage he sprang at the man who met him halfway grappled him close by the throat and with a deft twist threw him over on his back
BTS For we converted him in the end
BTS You live on an income which your father earned
BTS He looked at the potatoes spilling on his arm and at the small parcels on his other arm
BTS He belonged to them as all dogs belonged to them
BTS Life or death
BTS But we've got to do something
BTS Being but partly grown his jaws had not yet become large enough nor strong enough to make his throat-attack deadly
BTS The mate  But he did not finish
BTS Nature had been more generous to him than to the average animal that was all
BTS You are a god and God cannot be killed
BTS Thus would the leaders of the enemy be removed from the field of the local battles that would inevitably be fought all over the land
BTS and I could see nothing but her face and a mass of light brown hair escaping from under the seaman's cap on her head
BTS Sons will succeed fathers and there will be no inflow of new strength from that eternal reservoir of strength the common people
BTS And so I
BTS Who's to pull or steer or sail ship if he loses yer
BTS I was aware of a hungry out-reaching for her as of a starving man for bread
BTS The cry in all Asia was Asia for the Asiatics
BTS And all the time though he did not look he could hear her snarling just one leap behind
BTS Silence would do no good
BTS Wolf Larsen was nearly to the top though I could not see him
BTS The death which Wolf Larsen and even Thomas Mugridge had made me fear I no longer feared
BTS That's why
BTS Driving snow a wind that cut like a white-hot knife and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping place
BTS There is a large balance left over unconsumed
BTS His face underwent a sudden change
BTS Twice he fell over when half up and on the third attempt managed to rise
BTS But nothing happened
BTS As I writhed about I could see in his eyes that curiosity I had so often noted that wonder and perplexity that questing that everlasting query of his as to what it was all about
BTS Under the capitalist regime these periods of hard times were as inevitable as they were absurd
BTS How could I explain my idealism to this man
BTS He lay quietly where he had fallen
BTS Scott shook his head and went on trying to win White Fang's confidence
BTS And for a moment the thought rose in my mind What if he were overawed by this imposing array of power and brains
BTS I doubt if one of them was interested in any business the total capitalization of which exceeded a couple of hundred thousand dollars
BTS She possessed a gentle caressing tongue that soothed him when it passed over his soft little body and that impelled him to snuggle close against her and to doze off to sleep
BTS An' I'll bet it ain't far from five feet long
BTS Also there was awe in their faces
BTS Chapter VII
BTS I mean just that
BTS And this was due I believe first to habit
BTS Also I saw a great wave curling and foaming poised far above the rail
BTS In years and years not one of them has been in contact with a good woman or within the influence or redemption which irresistibly radiates from such a creature
BTS Don't you see there in the stern-sheets on the bottom
BTS Over fifty per cent are thralls by virtue of the fact that they are merely tenants or are mortgaged
BTS Wolf Larsen had taken to his bunk with one of his strange splitting headaches
BTS Asmunsen's narrative of his tribulations as a quarry owner
BTS The effect of all this was to rob White Fang of much of his puppyhood and to make him in his comportment older than his age
BTS Besides time and place were not meet and I wished to earn a better right to declare my love
BTS I looked hastily at the lantern
BTS He knew well the psychology of the little thing and it was the little things by which he kept the crew worked up to the verge of madness
BTS Filling a coffee-pot and frying-pan with part of my plunder and taking some chinaware from the cabin pantry I left Wolf Larsen lying in the sun and went ashore
BTS The spell of the cub's heritage was upon him the fear and the respect born of the centuries of struggle and the accumulated experience of the generations
BTS But at the right moment I passed the tackle to the Kanaka while Wolf Larsen did the same thing forward to Kerfoot
BTS It was the beginning of the end for White Fang the ending of the old life and the reign of hate
BTS Too long had he cultivated reticence aloofness and moroseness
BTS Knowing him I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding
BTS I guess I'll sit down and take the sunshine I heard Wolf Larsen saying
BTS Was I then being carried out to sea
BTS By virtue of that power we shall remain in power
BTS Hammerfield spluttered
BTS There were more men and many women and children forty souls of them and all heavily burdened with camp equipage and outfit
BTS A pair of beasts is what we were penned together and showing our teeth
BTS The wind was now dead astern muttering and puffing stronger and stronger and my head-sails were pounding lustily
BTS It never went entirely back to its normal shape and was called a cauliflower ear by the sailors
BTS but I threw all restraint to the winds and cut and slashed until the whole man of him was snarling
BTS The nausea overpowered me and I managed to crawl to the side of the vessel
BTS Morning found the man haggard and worn wide-eyed from want of sleep
BTS By the very nature of the socialist state the German population would consume all that it produced
BTS It marked his adaptability his capacity to adjust himself to changing conditions the lack of which would have meant swift and terrible death
BTS I pulled till I burst open the ends of all my fingers
BTS He exchanged the whip for the customary club
BTS A sentimentalist he sneered like Mr
BTS They should carry out your plan with expedition
BTS Thus at the first shock would the Iron Heel be brought to earth and lie practically dismembered
BTS He nodded his head
BTS This accomplished the hook was cut out
BTS I felt that I could survive but a few minutes
BTS I understood quite a good deal of First Principles but his Biology took the wind out of my sails and his Psychology left me butting around in the doldrums for many a day
BTS She was very tentative at first until she divined my harmlessness
BTS And I remembered his end upon the cross and my heart contracted with a pang as I thought of Ernest
BTS It was uncanny
BTS I shall try to write simply and to tell here how Ernest Everhard entered my life--how I first met him how he grew until I became a part of him and the tremendous changes he wrought in my life
BTS So the grey cub knew fear though he knew not the stuff of which fear was made
BTS Common shell and shrapnel were thrown in upon them from a distance and when in their desperation they charged the encircling lines they were mowed down by the machine-guns
BTS and though the meat was proffered to him with short inviting thrusts of the hand he refused to touch it
BTS Dr
BTS Yes sir came the answer of a spirit cowed
BTS Of such things he had not the faintest glimmering
BTS The New York Legislature passed a law restricting work in bakeries to ten hours a day
BTS She came close to me and shouted I'm dreadfully afraid
BTS But I tremble for you when I think of all you are to prove by Jackson's arm
BTS It might be lying thus that he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand
BTS He picked the quarrel with the strange dog while the gang waited
BTS All had been arranged
BTS Mrs
BTS White Fang could hear Grey Beaver's squaw taking part in the search and Mit-sah who was Grey Beaver's son
BTS What else are they
BTS Ernest began by describing the army of revolution and as he gave the figures of its strength the votes cast in the various countries the assemblage began to grow restless
BTS We spoke of it and he said that he had never been so healthy in his life
BTS Thornton knelt down by Buck's side
BTS of Ernest's was ringing in my consciousness
BTS White Fang was glad to acknowledge his lordship but it was a lordship based upon superior intelligence and brute strength
BTS He stepped up to the hatch-cover and all caps came off
BTS It cannot help itself
BTS It was better to eat small live things like ptarmigan chicks and to let alone large live things like ptarmigan hens
BTS His mother coming home growled as she smelt the wolverine's track and bounded into the cave and licked and nozzled him with undue vehemence of affection
BTS The jerks perceptibly diminished
BTS Duty rose above fear and thieving gods learned to leave Grey Beaver's property alone
BTS Where we were I did not know though there was quite a likelihood that we were in the vicinity of the Ghost
BTS I ain't been trailed this way by wolves before but I've gone through a whole lot worse an' kept my health
BTS I knew it was coming
BTS You have merely made a few excited and dogmatic assertions about my mental caliber
BTS We of the labor hosts have conned that word over till our minds are all a-tingle with it
BTS And take notice here that what is true of this particular industrial process is true of all industrial processes
BTS Am I not right
BTS Chapter I
BTS He was awakened from self-consciousness but as he drew near his eyes took on a strange expression
BTS No window
BTS We fell into discussion philosophy science evolution religion
BTS He skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt
BTS It stood back from the road half hidden among the trees through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides
BTS But out of this flux of society something is about to crystallize
BTS He always was a fool dog said Bill
BTS Get out of my way or I'll fix you
BTS It seems as simple as A B C
BTS Thornton did not reply
BTS Don't I know
BTS Nor was he executed by the comrades as is commonly supposed
BTS He was crying with sheer rage and eagerness as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in
BTS The wonder was that Ernest was not executed
BTS while I armed could always forestall him should he attempt to grapple me with his terrible gorilla arms
BTS That is the revolution
BTS The hard obstruction of the cave-wall the sharp nudge of his mother's nose the smashing stroke of her paw the hunger unappeased of several famines had borne in upon him that all was not freedom in the world that to life there was limitations and restraints
BTS Almost immediately he launched into a discussion on love
BTS And furthermore I'm not done with you
BTS Most savage of all was the Japanese Oligarchy that arose
BTS In that day there were many thousands of these poor merchants called PEDLERS
BTS So it was you was it you black beggar
BTS The wise heads have puzzled so sorely over truth because they went up into the air after it
BTS It was too much for me to witness
BTS And if it storms very hard
BTS Swinging around the shattered walls of a building in the stockyards district the automobile was stopped by a wave of dead
BTS The pilot-boat plunged past
BTS No more would he conjugate the verb to do in every mood and tense
BTS But he was not compelled to take injustice from the other gods
BTS In his judgment Sol-leks was the best lead-dog left
BTS By this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the Southland had fallen away from the three people
BTS He put a few spokes over and I watched the compass-card swing slowly to N
BTS The cub cowered closer to the ground
BTS They will become worshippers of beauty
BTS Will you get a tourniquet Mr
BTS Kerfoot thus directly addressed was startled into dropping his knife on the floor though he managed to grunt affirmation
BTS He was never known to lose his footing
BTS The restful loneliness of the only life he had known was gone
BTS Whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon
BTS Bill waved his hand at it threateningly and shouted loudly
BTS while the dogs were learning more and more that it was better to be at peace with him than at war and Grey Beaver was coming to prize him more greatly with the passage of each day
BTS And is that all
BTS The Plutocracy by virtue of its possession of the government raised their taxes
BTS he asked so innocently that Wolf Larsen was disconcerted while the others smiled
BTS The night yawned about him
BTS The sound of it was metallic
BTS Weedon Scott patted him and his throat rumbled an acknowledging growl
BTS There seemed a question in them this time and as before he looked at me over long
BTS There was no defending it
BTS Ducking turning doubling he slid about the deck eluding the other's efforts to capture him
BTS His lambs must be fed bread and butter and potatoes and meat
BTS You may die to-day this week or next month
BTS An' I tell you right now Henry I'm goin' to get her
BTS There was imperative need to be constantly alert
BTS Sorry but I've lost the signal book overboard he remarked and the group of hunters grinned
BTS One day she led him off on a long chase through the back-pasture land into the woods
BTS Ernest was madly impatient to be out in the world and doing for our ill-fated First Revolt that had miscarried in the Chicago Commune was ripening fast
BTS bomb and knife and bullet were looked upon as so many fangs of the roaring abysmal beast they must dominate if humanity were to persist
BTS Ernest was speaking
BTS He testified to this at the trial but no one believed him
BTS With all respect to Avis Everhard it must be pointed out that Everhard was but one of many able leaders who planned the Second Revolt
BTS It was warfare dark and devious replete with intrigue and conspiracy plot and counterplot
BTS They served as leaders of troops and as lieutenants and captains of industry
BTS No I am not
BTS His big fists were clenching and unclenching and his face was positively fiendish so malignantly did he look at Johnson
BTS They were young girls brave souls and passionate lovers of liberty Lora Peterson who disappeared in 1922 and Kate Bierce who later married Du Bois and who is still with us with eyes lifted to to-morrow's sun that heralds in the new age
BTS Keep back he warned me
BTS He was speaking rapidly now and his eyes were flashing
BTS The savings bank deposit is simply a piece of the loaf put back on the shelf to be eaten next day
BTS He had no abstract ideas about justice and fair play
BTS He was clad in a blue uniform and I remember noting how trim and quiet he was
BTS Do you think so
BTS They never had a moment's rest or peace
BTS Yes I do
BTS One of these was fidelity
BTS He worked for Wickson in the stables near the hunting lodge
BTS He struck me as stupid and yet the deftness with which he worked with his one hand seemed to belie his stupidity
BTS They do not know mankind nor society and yet they set themselves up as arbiters of the fates of the hungry millions and all the other millions thrown in
BTS He paused and we waited
BTS The quarter-strain of dog he had inherited from Kiche had left no mark on him physically though it had played its part in his mental make-up
BTS We've only just started and we can't quit at the beginning
BTS Scott's eyes were shining
BTS In the mere detail of voice intonation I practised almost perpetually till the voice of my new self became fixed automatic
BTS No high backbone of island sheltered us from the wind and it whistled and bellowed about the hut till at times I feared for the strength of the walls
BTS And so it ended with the phrase she knew had all power over me
BTS This served as a relish and his hunger increased mightily
BTS Into the air he lifted his body in the spring that landed him on the strange god's back
BTS Doubt and distrust showed strongly in his face
BTS Father will be rejoiced to see you I said
BTS Where's my wife
BTS I promise  To obey as a sailor would obey his captain
BTS I saw some of the cases at the sanitarium
BTS Why should I leave one comfortable soul in comfort when there are millions in travail and misery
BTS White Fang trembled waiting for the punishment to fall upon him
BTS He died in Cabanas in Cuba where three of his comrades were also confined
BTS That will of his was breaking down
BTS We had won over the Grangers and in the spring a dozen states would pass into their hands by virtue of the elections of the preceding fall
BTS So I thought at the time
BTS What would death be like
BTS It was at this time that Senator Mark Hanna said The production of wealth in the United States is one-third larger annually than its consumption
BTS But these two affairs were only the opening events of the day's programme
BTS And by that old fossil
BTS Over and done with
BTS It is a bribe he said
BTS Young man you have dreamed all this
BTS When he heard Thornton's command repeated he partly reared out of the water throwing his head high as though for a last look then turned obediently toward the bank
BTS We'll keep him and give him an education
BTS You clean swindled Beauty Smith on top of pushin' his face in with your fist
BTS All right he beamed good-naturedly and I'll tell you where to find him
BTS but before that flaming sheet of death nothing could live
BTS Here
BTS There was nothing the matter with them except that they were dead tired
BTS A hundred yards away I saw the boat-puller pass a rifle to the hunter
BTS But that was all
BTS She strove bravely to hide it from me but while I was kindling another fire I knew she was stifling her sobs in the blankets under the sail-tent
BTS Did he lie down to sleep he was stirred up by a sharp stick so that the audience might get its money's worth
BTS In his conception of things there was no future life
BTS The way was clear and that was all he had wanted
BTS Maud even contrived at times when all my efforts could not budge the windlass to hold the turn with one hand and with the other to throw the weight of her slim body to my assistance
BTS But when the strangers walk became stiff-legged and his lips lifted clear of his teeth White Fang stiffened too and answered with lifted lips
BTS For such destruction of property innocent men were frequently punished--railroaded in the parlance of the times
BTS Its effect on him was that of an impression of power
BTS The Church was dumb then and before I go on I want you either flatly to agree with me or flatly to disagree with me
BTS there you are the ship's precise location
BTS It's a lee shore I laughed and I am sure I'd rather be here than arriving a night like this
BTS He did not love his kind and he was shrewd enough to escape hurt himself
BTS His eyes fixed intently on the sea astern suddenly flashed
BTS But the country did permit it Ernest replied
BTS And is not my brother dead
BTS the labor castes and the Oligarchy will crumble away
BTS Scott turned to see
BTS The years of prosperity were now to be paid for
BTS All the young dogs followed Lip-lip's lead
BTS He had bought the ranch for beauty and paid a round price for it much to the disgust of the local farmers
BTS But White Fang could not get at the soft underside of the throat
BTS He rushed as though attempting the old shoulder trick but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in
BTS This the Plutocracy found an easy task
BTS The divisions of society have become too widely separated
BTS The stage was set for a world-catastrophe for in all the world were hard times labor troubles perishing middle classes armies of unemployed clashes of economic interests in the world-market and mutterings and rumblings of the socialist revolution
BTS And that the strength in me had quieted her and given her confidence filled me with an exultant joy
BTS I spread before me a wrinkled letter written to me by Ernest twenty years ago and from it I copy the following Your father is a member of the Philomath so you are able to come
BTS Promises and agreements were broken and most drastic punishments visited upon even petty offenders
BTS And from then on Ernest pinned his faith in revolution
BTS while dolphin meat is served fore and aft on such occasions as Johnson catches the blazing beauties from the bowsprit end
BTS The boat was caught as it obliquely crossed the crest of a wave
BTS but he did it craftily when Francois was not around With the covert mutiny of Buck a general insubordination sprang up and increased
BTS On the other hand possibly because he divined in Buck a dangerous rival Spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth
BTS Only the persecution
BTS These gods also made overtures to White Fang but he warned them off with a snarl and the master did likewise with word of mouth
BTS but Wolf Larsen's fist drove midway between on the chest with a crushing resounding impact
BTS Humphrey
BTS The Benton Harbor refuge was a catacomb the entrance of which was cunningly contrived by way of a well
BTS Of course I understand
BTS For a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down
BTS He did not steal for joy of it but because of the clamor of his stomach
BTS At times I thought of throwing myself on the mercy of Wolf Larsen but the vision of the mocking devil in his eyes that questioned life and sneered at it would come strong upon me and compel me to refrain
BTS I've seen too many of 'em cut up an' gouged an' chawed not to know
BTS My muscles are growing harder and increasing in size
BTS Keep your eyes upon Knowlton
BTS And at the same time were arrested all socialist Congressmen in Washington including the unfortunate Simpson who lay ill with typhoid fever in his hotel
BTS but a certain measure of controlled anger he allowed himself
BTS Wolf Larsen did not seem affected however
BTS Incidentally its public schools deteriorated and education slowly ceased to be compulsory
BTS A snarl and a flash of fangs and that dog would wail his indignation to the uncomforting stars while White Fang finished his portion for him
BTS and several lesser luminaries in the field of morality and charity
BTS Yet during those first days of our love fear of the future came often to me when I thought of the violence and impetuosity of his love-making
BTS Think it'll ride
BTS The air was filled with oaths and indecent expressions
BTS The mate cursed him in the darkness and the next moment some missile struck the galley a sharp rap
BTS Here's your money
BTS But those are actual things
BTS In its own way it was preparing to set these millions to work but the way was not our way wherefore it had issued its orders that our bill should be voted down
BTS Because I am not a pure exalted soul was the answer
BTS But there was one thing that he never outgrew his growling
BTS Wolf Larsen shouted himself springing to the wheel and whirling it over
BTS He obeyed his natural impulses until they ran him counter to some law
BTS We smiled again said amusing things and waxed optimistic over our situation
BTS He studied the habits of the squirrel with greater carefulness and strove with greater craft to steal upon it and surprise it
BTS She answered with a grateful little smile that sent my heart pounding and started to descend the companion-stairs
BTS He could not stand being laughed at
BTS No more grease and dirt mind and a clean shirt occasionally or you'll get a tow over the side
BTS He wrenched and writhed about convulsively
BTS Then I counted the dogs an' there was still six of 'em
BTS I prompted
BTS He could escape into safety while the god was scrambling to his feet
BTS Dead astern sir
BTS He did not rob openly but stole secretly and cunningly out of respect for club and fang
BTS At first he was not heard
BTS My whole right side is affected
BTS The state court sustained the decision
BTS Here he comes now she whispered
BTS Johansen call all hands
BTS And there will be counter-palace revolutions of the oligarchs and sometimes the one and sometimes the other will be in power
BTS He fled away to Grey Beaver behind whose protecting legs he crouched when the bitten boy and the boy's family came demanding vengeance
BTS We were squeezed out
BTS That is why he got to America
BTS It is no less unreal now that I look back upon it
BTS Her conscience did not trouble her for at that very time occurred the Nashville Massacre when the Mercenaries Donnelly in command literally murdered eight hundred weavers of that city
BTS He still held the wheel and I felt that he was timing Time reckoning the passage of the minutes with each forward lunge and leeward roll of the Ghost
BTS Mr
BTS Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labour that I had laboured to do
BTS I've hearn sailors talk of sharks followin' a ship Bill remarked as he crawled back into the blankets after one such replenishing of the fire
BTS Van Weyden you'd better look in on Cooky
BTS He was confused and blinded by the rush of it and the beat of angry wings
BTS He is the creature of his desires and of the two desires he obeys the strongest one that is all
BTS He sprang through the sleeping camp and in swift silence dashed through the woods
BTS Stand from under you Johansen
BTS Henry called
BTS A curious and amazing literature that served to make the working class utterly misapprehend the nature of the leisure class
BTS White Fang remained on the Yukon the property of a man more than half mad and all brute
BTS for when Hartman had succeeded in withdrawing the bundle we found that it consisted of large printed sheets the proclamations of the revolutionists
BTS The genial playful puppyish side of him found little expression
BTS Nature spills it out with a lavish hand
BTS Now I'll 'ave to boil some more
BTS How great the risk I realized when I was once more buried beneath the pounding seas and clinging for life to the pinrail at the foot of the foremast
BTS Here he removed the shoes and still hiding trail for a distance at last put on his own shoes
BTS He counted them with care and then joined his partner in cursing the power of the Wild that had robbed them of another dog
BTS That fool One Ear don't seem scairt much Bill said in a low tone
BTS I was Hump cabin-boy on the schooner Ghost
BTS White Fang stood before him growling fiercely
BTS an' a piece at a time he went up a leg to-day an' to-morrow an arm the next day the head an' so on
BTS They swung out on the trail with remarkable lack of exertion turned their heads uneasily and stopped in surprise
BTS Have you ever considered where you will stand when the great trusts themselves combine into the combination of combinations--into the social economic and political trust
BTS By evening Perrault secured another dog an old husky long and lean and gaunt with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect
BTS He took Garthwaite's name and number then turned to me
BTS Here were many men and countless dogs and Buck found them all at work
BTS Such was his confidence that when a moose-bird impudently hopped up to him he reached out at it with a playful paw
BTS Also I am suffering from boils due to the diet most likely for I was never afflicted in this manner before
BTS Matt was rolling the master's blankets and fur robe inside a small tarpaulin
BTS The woman in front doubled up and went down her hands on her abdomen in a frenzied clutch
BTS They were of the same large type as Thornton living close to the earth thinking simply and seeing clearly
BTS You ain't going to take him out now
BTS I had seen whisky drunk such as whisky-and-soda by the men of the clubs but never as these men drank it from pannikins and mugs and from the bottles great brimming drinks each one of which was in itself a debauch
BTS I nodded my identity in turn
BTS And then it surely was congenial work for Ernest and furthermore my jealous pride in him made me hail the proffered appointment as a recognition of his abilities
BTS Before White Fang could spring in and deliver the fatal stroke and just as he was in the act of springing in Collie arrived
BTS H
BTS Life proved not to be fine and gracious
BTS But the moment he left the protection of the fire the boldest wolf leaped for him but leaped short
BTS Early one evening while it was yet twilight I had run across the street and into the butcher-shop to get some chops for Ernest's supper
BTS but he must have the advantage of every chance
BTS She aroused smiled drowsily and was off to sleep again
BTS When that goes I go
BTS My eyes had spoken I knew until I had found the culprits out and silenced them
BTS Each was nothing that the other was everything that the other was not
BTS Once the only way past two strong positions of the comrades was through a burnt section that lay between
BTS Far from it far from it he laughed a moment later
BTS It was an exact duplicate of our train though it contained no passengers
BTS In fact we slept till three in the afternoon or at least I did for I awoke to find Maud cooking dinner
BTS But Hartman was cool and was giving the proper passwords
BTS This wild stirring of yeasty life this terrific revolt and defiance of matter that moved perplexed and interested him
BTS Each night after Sierra Vista had gone to bed she rose and let in White Fang to sleep in the big hall
BTS I am courageous
BTS But she has erroneous ideas concerning the American flag and the protection it is supposed to symbolize
BTS It was a clear day and the sun was shining
BTS ' His face turned red and he was so confused that he forgot to tip me
BTS When you say you are here I'd suggest the likelihood of the soul I said
BTS The other lingered desperately for a moment and followed
BTS but this would be quite different from an unconsumable surplus
BTS And he with his incarnate spirit of battle his gladiator body and his eagle spirit--he was as gentle and tender to me as a poet
BTS As I lay there thinking I naturally dwelt upon myself and my situation
BTS What do you think I'd have got if I'd won Jackson's case
BTS She shook her head incredulously
BTS They half circled about each other tentatively snarling and bristling
BTS They were shot with their backs to the firing squad
BTS It was in his eyes that I saw the cause of her perturbation
BTS He looked at me insolently
BTS I beg your pardon I said
BTS The moment the sled started the team took after Lip-lip in a chase that extended throughout the day
BTS Also its appearance had changed
BTS It was dim-lighted
BTS And he had no recourse
BTS You an' me Henry when we die we'll be lucky if we get enough stones over our carcases to keep the dogs off of us
BTS While he lay in the bush recovering from his fright and peering fearfully out the mother-ptarmigan on the other side of the open space fluttered out of the ravaged nest
BTS But in this matter there was a difference and many differences
BTS The cook had glided in
BTS For all the world like a woman wringing her hands he raised his clenched fists and groaned
BTS They know only business
BTS You were afraid to die
BTS But to the cub the spectacle of her protective rage was pleasing
BTS Faint and far came the low thud of an explosion
BTS I ran across it in Spencer
BTS I felt an elation of spirit
BTS He deserves all that can be done for him
BTS They found careers in applied science and many of them became great engineers
BTS Later on two Indians arrived
BTS On May 21 1905 A
BTS He saw clearly the futility of the Bishop's great soul as coming events were soon to show as clearly to me
BTS Then he saw Bill standing amid the dogs half triumphant half crestfallen in one hand a stout club in the other the tail and part of the body of a sun-cured salmon
BTS when the fibre of him had become tough and knotty
BTS The wretched militiamen found that their machine-guns had been tampered with and that the cartridges from the captured magazines did not fit their rifles
BTS If you will remember some of the seed fell upon stony places where there was not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth
BTS All day they swung up and down the main street in long teams and in the night their jingling bells still went by
BTS As you know we're short a mate
BTS Yes Mugridge was saying an' wot does 'is worship do but give me two years in Reading
BTS No one ever came there not even the village boys of Glen Ellen
BTS It was not so much what he said as how he said it
BTS It's you that'll have to come inside
BTS The golden colour and the dancing lights were gone
BTS I noted them walking the deck together one morning and I likened them to the extreme ends of the human ladder of evolution the one the culmination of all savagery the other the finished product of the finest civilization
BTS I thought my right hand had done it--only it didn't
BTS and it's not me should tell you your business but I wouldn't tote that tent along if I was you
BTS I gasped caught my breath painfully and opened my eyes
BTS It is an attack upon all churches upon the pomp and splendor of all churches that have wandered from the Master's path and hedged themselves in from his lambs
BTS His transient masters since he had come into the Northland had bred in him a fear that no master could be permanent
BTS Life had become too populous
BTS Latimer pulled and the next couple of steps were made with a rush
BTS He winced but held on
BTS White Fang watched him
BTS Also a fellow-Senator Chauncey Depew said The American people produce annually two billions more wealth than they consume
BTS He was at high nervous tension and in his eyes there was unspeakable horror
BTS We noticed something strange about him at once
BTS He cleared his throat in embarrassment and I could see the sweat starting out on his forehead
BTS I did not know how to shoot but I proceeded to learn
BTS And there we found a little old German woman--sixty-four years old the Bishop said
BTS Wolf Larsen cried suddenly to the boat-puller
BTS Almost equally swift but not quite was Wolf Larsen
BTS Rendered curious by this new direction of ideas I talked with Johansen last night the first superfluous words with which he has favoured me since the voyage began
BTS Because of the low-roofed entrance the lynx could not leap in and when she made a crawling rush of it the she-wolf sprang upon her and pinned her down
BTS He had been over this ground before when it was bare but now a village occupied it
BTS He'll adjust himself all right
BTS but for us who had known the misery of the open boat it was a snug little habitation
BTS At such moments starting from a windward roll I would go flying through the air with dizzying swiftness as though I clung to the end of a huge inverted pendulum the arc of which between the greater rolls must have been seventy feet or more
BTS An unsatisfactory correspondence followed
BTS Buck because of his record was the target for these men and Thornton was driven stoutly to defend him
BTS His life flickered out in the storm I said
BTS Here in the factory was combination and before it competition faded away
BTS now he hunted in deadly earnestness and found nothing
BTS and you have no more hope against us than have the drones clustered about the honey-vats when the worker-bees spring upon them to end their rotund existence
BTS There was no response
BTS ' It is a question not of grammar but of ethics I answered
BTS But sights and sounds and smells were different from those he had last had when he fled away from it
BTS CHAPTER XXII THE CHICAGO COMMUNE As agents-provocateurs not alone were we able to travel a great deal but our very work threw us in contact with the proletariat and with our comrades the revolutionists
BTS The lords of society stole legally or else legalized their stealing while the poorer classes stole illegally
BTS As a motif in song and story it constantly crops up
BTS We will be content with nothing less than all that you possess
BTS White Fang made several ineffectual efforts to get up
BTS One devil dat Spitz remarked Perrault
BTS The qualities in his kind that in the beginning made it possible for them to come in to the fires of men were qualities capable of development
BTS In an hour what of this and of rests between the heaving I had hoisted it to the point where I could hoist no more
BTS He was greeted with snarls by his kind with curses and stones by his gods
BTS and this made his damnation certain
BTS He resembled a man on the verge of a fit
BTS The figures of misery would have precipitated the revolution that even now is gathering
BTS These great works will be the form their expenditure of the surplus will take and in the same way that the ruling classes of Egypt of long ago expended the surplus they robbed from the people by the building of temples and pyramids
BTS In the Northland he had evidenced his fealty by toiling in the harness
BTS The Plutocracy has all power in its hands to-day
BTS He could resist the call of the world no longer
BTS This had saved me for the jam had quickly become too dense for anything more than the mad gripping and tearing of hands
BTS He wanted it because it was his nature because he had been gripped tight by that nameless incomprehensible pride of the trail and trace that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp which lures them to die joyfully in the harness and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness
BTS His smashing sledge-hammer manner of attack invariably made them forget themselves
BTS I spoke of the professional men and the artists as villeins
BTS The deck was continually awash with the sea which came inboard over the rail and through the scuppers
BTS But the courts I urged
BTS White Fang followed closely at the master's heels
BTS Never had he seen such a dog
BTS But by our law believe me it is quite lawful
BTS but when they took their seats in the spring of 1913 they found themselves without power of any sort
BTS He became very sick so sick that Matt was finally compelled to bring him inside the cabin
BTS We can do it I amended
BTS When everybody was guilty how was anybody to be punished
BTS With four hundred miles of trail still between him and Dawson he could ill afford to have madness break out among his dogs
BTS He started for the companion-way and stepped forward quite as I had been accustomed to see him do
BTS You have all the advantage
BTS He moved his hand over the array of volumes on the walls of his tiny office
BTS It seemed that Johansen in his sleep lived over each night the events of the day
BTS It was the unknown objectified at last in concrete flesh and blood bending over him and reaching down to seize hold of him
BTS And then we quite forgot where we were leaving Wolf Larsen stranded and silent in the midst of our flood of gossip
BTS If you want to keep out of trouble you'll steer clear of him that's my talk
BTS And some men are made sick by the one and some by the other
BTS They got Bill an' they may get me but they'll sure never get you young man he said addressing the dead body in its tree-sepulchre
BTS I wanted to kiss it to ripple it through my fingers to bury my face in it
BTS The fingers could not close on it
BTS There was no warning only a leap in like a flash a metallic clip of teeth a leap out equally swift and Curly's face was ripped open from eye to jaw
BTS He stood by the weather rail for a time we were lowering over the lee rail and then sauntered slowly amidships where he again paused and stood facing the wind with his back toward us
BTS Next came my repulsion when he so savagely attacked my class and me
BTS Though in splendid physical trim a thirty-six-hour trick at the wheel was the limit of my endurance
BTS He had gone to the roots of White Fang's nature and with kindness touched to life potencies that had languished and well-nigh perished
BTS They complained
BTS I did not turn my head though I expected every moment a killing blow from the human brute behind me
BTS One was into the Socialist Party
BTS I shall not be able to side with you openly and no matter what indignities may be put upon me you are to remain likewise silent
BTS Already the canoes were departing and some had disappeared down the river
BTS The meal went on
BTS Come on you wolf
BTS How about this here tide that's rushin' out through the Golden Gate
BTS You pompously call yourselves Republicans and Democrats
BTS but the dead know not anything neither have they any more a reward
BTS White Fang looked on at first
BTS It was a monotonous life operating with machine-like regularity
BTS Hammerfield cried
BTS I wisht we was pullin' into McGurry right now he began again
BTS An hour of this passed when the vibrations of feet in contact with the ground foreran the one who approached
BTS I feel as if all time were echoing through me as though all powers were mine
BTS There they became outlaws and it was not until more peaceful times that they received their punishment
BTS I spoke to him but he made no answer though his head was still rocking from side to side and he was not asleep
BTS Remember that
BTS And always he checked them back to facts
BTS We got back to find Ernest alarmed by my absence
BTS We must have been caught nearly at the centre of this circular storm and Wolf Larsen ran out of it and to the southward first under a double-reefed jib and finally under bare poles
BTS Maud asked cheerfully when the task was accomplished and I pulled on my mittens
BTS 'Look here Professor' he said 'this is too much
BTS There it stands on its two hind-legs club in hand immensely potential passionate and wrathful and loving god and mystery and power all wrapped up and around by flesh that bleeds when it is torn and that is good to eat like any flesh
BTS He ripped them open or split their skulls with shrewdly driven blows of his great hoofs
BTS and now that he looked at the sled itself the concrete fact with the regular team of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it the more impossible the task appeared
BTS He is a favourite of yours I said
BTS But the others did not see this radiance and I assumed that it was due to the tears of joy and love that dimmed my vision
BTS Close in under the sheltering rock Buck made his nest
BTS It's not over the hole she add
BTS William Randolph Hearst--a young California millionaire who became the most powerful newspaper owner in the country
BTS We were a dozen feet apart
BTS She was found insane
BTS Judge Scott nodded his head in agreement
BTS Nevertheless it will make a great impression what the Bishop did and said to-night I said
BTS Toward the end I heard her moving about within the hut making her toilet
BTS We found that labor could buy back with its wages only so much of the product and that capital did not consume all of the remainder of the product
BTS But I am afraid and never stay long in one place
BTS Then she ate the dogs
BTS Was this present life of a revolutionist hiding in a hole a nightmare
BTS Time and again he fought it out with Leach who fought back always like a wildcat tooth and nail and fist until stretched exhausted or unconscious on the deck
BTS He was the food and the sight of him excited in her the gustatory sensations
BTS I could not swim but before I could sink I was swept back again
BTS It was the reward of death
BTS Clasped in the hollow of her arm as a child might be clasped was a bundle of printed matter
BTS I play the braver part
BTS Father was silent for a few minutes
BTS I was indeed clumsy in those days
BTS And so we talked while the killing of the wounded went on
BTS Never in all my life have I heard so many fallacies uttered in one short hour
BTS At the same moment Matt noticed two objects lying in the snow
BTS Big things are happening secretly all around us
BTS What are we going to have
BTS It was so much added fuel to the flame of his fierceness
BTS The night was a repetition of the night before save that the need for sleep was becoming overpowering
BTS He can gnaw through leather as clean as a knife an' jes' about half as quick
BTS It's the bloody mate
BTS They were given short shrift
BTS This occurred in 2002 A
BTS There were days when he crept to the edge of the forest and stood and listened to something calling him far and away
BTS And ever out of the north-east the brave wind blows driving us on our course two hundred and fifty miles between the dawns
BTS Watch them wobble and go to pieces and their members become slaves driven to toil by empty stomachs and the law of the land
BTS All things come alike to all
BTS Pike crippled and limping only half conscious and not conscious enough longer to malinger
BTS I'll wager they've made a text-book out of his 'Benevolent Feudalism
BTS From to-day a child will be able to navigate a ship
BTS I was born to sufferin' and sorrer
BTS It was caused by his trying to save the company a few dollars
BTS Beyond a doubt it was the Macedonia
BTS They were shooting at us with one of the small cannon which rumour had said they carried on board
BTS the boom-boom of guns and the pitiful slaughter through the long day
BTS When summer came on he elected to sweat out a hot and dusty existence in the city and to toil incessantly
BTS He would lie by the hour eager alert at Thornton's feet looking up into his face dwelling upon it studying it following with keenest interest each fleeting expression every movement or change of feature
BTS There was no work for him to do
BTS and having done so every metaphysician can prove every other metaphysician wrong--to his own satisfaction
BTS Perhaps it was from excess
BTS I'm goin' to get you Cooky he said and I'll get you hard
BTS I asked
BTS While old One Eye the wolf crouching in the covert played his part too in the game waiting for some strange freak of Chance that might help him on the meat-trail which was his way of life
BTS It remains for your breath to smash my prophecy
BTS He was plainly expectant of a rebuff and he was just as plainly surprised when her teeth did not flash out at him in anger
BTS Since White Fang continued to fight it is obvious that it was the other dogs that died
BTS Have you read him
BTS He went on whetting his knife
BTS I sprang upon him blindly insanely and drove the knife into his shoulder
BTS I'll show you Ernest said quietly
BTS The Wall Street Journal a stock gamesters' publication in commenting upon Lord Avebury's speech said These words were spoken by an aristocrat and a member of the most conservative body in all Europe
BTS Had this hole existed in the bed of a canyon a mile long or several miles long it would have been well known
BTS Haven't the least idea I said
BTS In the top one lay Oofty-Oofty a Kanaka and splendid seaman so named by his mates
BTS ' And then he turned and left me
BTS One of them Mr
BTS I dwelt upon the idea
BTS Heard him offering it
BTS Our thoughts were deep and solemn and we spoke to each other scarcely above whispers
BTS He began to accompany his mother on the meat-trail and he saw much of the killing of meat and began to play his part in it
BTS I realized that all those potatoes and that bread and butter and meat were mine and that I had not worked to make them
BTS It would do immense good
BTS And in open court-room before all men Jim Hall had proclaimed that the day would come when he would wreak vengeance on the Judge that sentenced him
BTS He was beginning to see red in whatever direction he looked
BTS I looked for his instant annihilation
BTS he cried down the open hatch
BTS He did not mingle with it but remained aloof always himself and was even feared by it
BTS Day by day unions and more unions voted their support to the socialists until even Ernest laughed when the Undertakers' Assistants and the Chicken Pickers fell into line
BTS He combined and made war upon his carnivorous enemies
BTS You have failed in your management of society and your management is to be taken away from you
BTS This was the thing I had set my mind upon doing but the opportunity never offered
BTS The four men greeted him with roars of laughter and explanations were made
BTS What has that to do with it
BTS There is no discussion of this
BTS The halyards became instantly taut
BTS Daylight came at nine o'clock
BTS With iron hand and iron heel it mastered the surging millions out of confusion brought order out of the very chaos wrought its own foundation and structure
BTS They die like flies
BTS And still later it was noticed that a pleased light came into his eyes when he saw them approaching and that he looked after them with an appearance of curious regret when they left him for other amusements
BTS By that I take it you see something that is alive but that necessarily does not have to live for ever
BTS Grey Beaver was a god and strong
BTS It struck me that he was joyous in a ferocious sort of way
BTS For a week she never left the cave except for water and then her movements were slow and painful
BTS Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose
BTS He did not try to run away but retreated around and around the camp advertising plainly that when his desire was met he would come in and be good
BTS This I know I did my best
BTS Opened up top and bottom like a sieve
BTS ' But railways could not alone absorb rapidly enough those mighty floods of gold
BTS The poor farmers were shot and hanged in great numbers
BTS By the way Hump as I have remarked you are a handy man Wolf Larsen began when my work was done
BTS Oh yes they did do something
BTS Whatever a sailor purchases is taken from his subsequent earnings on the sealing grounds
BTS Sauntering around the corner of the house in the early morning he came upon a chicken that had escaped from the chicken-yard
BTS I managed to make my way forward but there was little choice of sides for the weather-rail seemed buried as often as the lee
BTS So he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day's travel
BTS and father's happiness in our changed circumstances rounded out my own happiness
BTS This mother-weasel was so small and so savage
BTS Not at all
BTS They are strong efficient men
BTS They were guilty of torturing their prisoners to death
BTS Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley
BTS These three sails I gathered from the conversation were to be set immediately after breakfast
BTS There were no newspapers no letters no despatches
BTS But before that as trial judge he had earned sentence of death by his fiendish malignancy
BTS You try it then
BTS Still I pulled holding what I gained each time with a double turn until the next slap gave me more
BTS But father was not to be denied
BTS law
BTS The courts are in the hands of the trusts
BTS It was going hard with him
BTS But he ought not to be
BTS He disappeared one morning in the encircling fog with his two men and we never saw them again though it was not many days when we learned that they had passed from schooner to schooner until they finally regained their own
BTS Then he looked back eagerly and questioningly at the master
BTS He met Wickson accidentally on the street in San Francisco and he told Wickson that he was a damned scoundrel
BTS Think of it
BTS ha
BTS I gasped with the anguish and shock of it filling my lungs before the life-preserver popped me to the surface
BTS In the meantime Harrison had started out on the halyards
BTS Why couldn't one of you just one of you get me a knife when I sung out
BTS Frog's gone came the answer
BTS and between all the parts there was a perfect equilibrium or adjustment
BTS but the fear of the future was strong upon him and he was glad each time when he was not selected
BTS There will be a second and we will be wiser then
BTS These are merely a few of the things that went through my mind and are related for the sake of vindicating myself in advance in the weak and helpless role I was destined to play
BTS With the first slash Baseek's right ear was ripped into ribbons
BTS Henry Dallas the superintendent was a vulpine-faced creature who regarded me insolently and refused to talk
BTS It knows my operating expenses to a cent and it knows the terms of my contracts
BTS It was busy arming itself with the rifles of the slain and killing the wounded
BTS When his master had gone out White Fang turned loose and tore around the pen trying to get at the men outside
BTS But to return
BTS The Ghost was going very slowly and when her stern lifted on a wave and she slipped forward she pulled the wretch to the surface and gave him a moment in which to breathe
BTS They ate before the drivers ate and no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the feet of the dogs he drove
BTS We can measure the unknown only by the known I replied in my finest academic manner
BTS His chosen field was physics and in addition he did much original research and was greatly distinguished as a scientist
BTS But more remarkable than this the Yeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack
BTS and during the intervening weeks he must have suffered greatly from loneliness
BTS He even ventured to raise his fist to me but I was becoming animal-like myself and I snarled in his face so terribly that it must have frightened him back
BTS At half after five I went below to set the cabin table but I hardly knew what I did for my eyes and my brain were filled with the vision of a man white-faced and trembling comically like a bug clinging to the thrashing gaff
BTS Was the Church dumb then
BTS The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield
BTS from a blind man
BTS And through it all Buck staggered along at the head of the team as in a nightmare
BTS Johansen Wolf Larsen said briskly to the new mate keep all hands on deck now they're here
BTS The schooner heeled over far out from the perpendicular was bowing and plunging into the long Pacific roll
BTS Your chest heaves and strains
BTS First of all he had to learn the family of the master
BTS Forgotten were the days they had hunted together the game they had pulled down the famine they had suffered
BTS And there were so many of the people of the abyss
BTS He did the cooking for the other men in the fort the dish-washing and the drudgery
BTS What do you mean by that
BTS Ernest stopped and put the question point blank to a number of the men
BTS I was Mr
BTS Not that he was so very large--he stood only five feet nine inches
BTS The Ghost lay half-a-mile beyond the surf-line of a lonely beach
BTS The dogs had quarrels among themselves but these were forgotten when trouble was brewing with White Fang
BTS And you too Mr
BTS It was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food
BTS I am to receive a handsome fee--two hundred and fifty dollars--as befits the man who though a radical once ran for governor
BTS The life of his body and of every fibre of his body the life that was the very substance of his body and that was apart from his own personal life had yearned toward this light and urged his body toward it in the same way that the cunning chemistry of a plant urges it toward the sun
BTS A quarter of a mile from Glen Ellen after the second bridge is passed to the right will be noticed a barranca that runs like a scar across the rolling land toward a group of wooded knolls
BTS In addition to the labor castes there arose another caste the military
BTS I spoke to the cook about it when I went on deck to take up my duties in the galley and though I had looked forward to a surly answer I had not expected the belligerent harangue that I received
BTS Composed of men and women actuated by lofty purpose and unafraid to die the Fighting Groups exercised tremendous influence and tempered the savage brutality of the rulers
BTS I became restless and anxious and when Thomas Mugridge glared down the companion-way sick and angry of countenance I prepared to go about my duties
BTS He ain't had no chance yet
BTS Why should I be parsimonious with this life which is cheap and without value
BTS You are spineless flaccid things
BTS But what I wanted to say was this You are in a perilous position--a peril that my own fear enhances because I am not able even to measure it
BTS For my mind had leaped to a star-cool altitude and grasped a passionless transvaluation of values
BTS At six o'clock when I served supper going on deck to get the food from the galley I saw Harrison still in the same position
BTS The ex-governor of Idaho had been mysteriously murdered
BTS Thus did I receive my red baptism in that Chicago shambles
BTS And truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate raging at their heels and dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees
BTS One small woman
BTS for they too knew that safety lay open in the gaining of Fort McGurry
BTS What's the Constitution got to do with it
BTS And she was as direct as she was subtle
BTS And halfway to the crosstrees and flattened against the rigging by the full force of the wind so that it would have been impossible for me to have fallen the Ghost almost on her beam-ends and the masts parallel with the water I looked not down but at almost right angles from the perpendicular to the deck of the Ghost
BTS He sucked meditatively at his pipe for some time before he went on
BTS Isn't that so Kerfoot
BTS It had been all used the last least bit of it
BTS And after that  She looked at me queerly
BTS But love that was feverish and burning that was adoration that was madness it had taken John Thornton to arouse
BTS Something was impending
BTS only you've got me where you want me
BTS It never emerged
BTS Do you still hear
BTS An' right here I want to remark Bill went on that that animal's familyarity with campfires is suspicious an' immoral
BTS He was curious to observe them fearful of being noticed by them
BTS Nothing to disturb me
BTS A queer sense familiarity made me look again
BTS And there was reason for it
BTS He'll have to learn to walk again said the surgeon
BTS In vain we tried to see him to have his case reconsidered or investigated
BTS Write and let me know how he gets along
BTS We both mean the same thing the large capitalists or the trusts
BTS Once in a gust the rail dipped under the sea and the decks on that side were for the moment awash with water that made a couple of the hunters hastily lift their feet
BTS his brain was purged of the fancy that it was the duty of society to feed the Master's lambs
BTS But he had little time to marvel at the transformation
BTS I could scarcely accept the verdict of my senses
BTS It was he who directed the pack's course on the heels of the she-wolf
BTS It will be great art I tell you and wonder cities will arise that will make tawdry and cheap the cities of old time
BTS And with the coming of the night brooding and mourning by the pool Buck became alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the Yeehats had made He stood up listening and scenting
BTS Without thinking about it he accepted this disappearing into the wall as a peculiarity of his father as milk and half-digested meat were peculiarities of his mother
BTS They were evidently coming down the creek from some prospecting trip
BTS But even his tremendous will could not overcome the dissolution that assailed it
BTS There
BTS It buys so much food
BTS One of them dare-devil launches he said
BTS The cabin light was burning low
BTS He could not loose his war-dogs
BTS Avis will stand by my side in what is to come
BTS What happened after that was very confusing
BTS And here I must say a word for that gentle-souled terrorist than whom there is no comrade in the Revolution more fearfully misunderstood
BTS He was undoubtedly a great genius
BTS I stood motionless a roll of antiseptic cotton in my hand unwinding and spilling itself down to the floor
BTS I cut no more than was necessary and what with passing the long ropes under and around the booms and masts of unreeving the halyards and sheets of coiling down in the boat and uncoiling in order to pass through another knot in the bight I was soon wet to the skin
BTS For don't you see the railway men machinists and engineers iron and steel workers do all of the vitally essential work in our machine civilization
BTS His had softened during the many generations since the day his last wild ancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man
BTS Also he held White Fang's nose down to the slain hens and at the same time cuffed him soundly
BTS Faithfulness and devotion things born of fire and roof were his
BTS ha
BTS I was in my brougham driving through the streets
BTS The team dispersed in ignominious defeat and it was not until after dark that the dogs came sneaking back one by one by meekness and humility signifying their fealty to White Fang
BTS One was blown to pieces in the air the expedite exploding and the shock of it disrupted the second balloon which fell prettily into the remaining fortress
BTS It was not until her racket had faded away in the distance and died out that One Eye ventured forth
BTS Nothin' came the answer
BTS I'm not saying anything O'Connor answered sullenly
BTS It must have been painful I said sympathetically
BTS With some difficulty and at the expense of a wetting to the waist I climbed aboard
BTS Also he saw Wolf Larsen's rifle bearing upon him and knew he would be shot ere he could get his rifle into play
BTS The muscles refused their duty
BTS CHAPTER X THE VORTEX Following like thunder claps upon the Business Men's dinner occurred event after event of terrifying moment
BTS Death as a cessation of movement as a passing out and away from the lives of the living he knew and he knew John Thornton was dead
BTS Buck stalked into the open half crouching body gathered compactly together tail straight and stiff feet falling with unwonted care
BTS What do you intend doing with Leach and Johnson
BTS No need to be I gulped
BTS At the best that was all
BTS Far as it might have seemed no man has ever seen very far into Wolf Larsen's soul or seen it at all of this I am convinced
BTS Again that unnamable and unmistakable terror was in her eyes and she said almost in a whisper You are Lucifer
BTS It had happened many times yet each time it was as fresh a surprise as ever to him
BTS Because of his discoveries he was banished from his native country and he died an exile in England
BTS Having completed my survey of the horizon I turned to my more immediate surroundings
BTS Why will they not let me alone
BTS Also they grew irritated when I told them of the deplorable condition of Jackson's family and when I wondered that they had made no voluntary provision for the man
BTS No
BTS An appreciable time after that the great column of the explosion towered in the air and after that in turn I heard the roar of it
BTS Straight forward he raced the boat-puller Harrison at his heels and gaining on him
BTS By hand pressures after that he answered our questions and when he wished to speak he scrawled his thoughts with his left hand quite legibly on a sheet of paper
BTS Then I went below to Maud
BTS In the great storm of 1927 while attending a meeting of our leaders he contracted the pneumonia of which he died
BTS It is in line with evolution
BTS At first she caressed the cub and licked his wounded shoulder
BTS You might have suggested a window when the walls were going up I said
BTS Why not
BTS It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap
BTS He studied it with unceasing vigilance
BTS Certainly Ernest answered
BTS As it is forward and in the galley so it is in the steerage and aft on this veritable hell-ship
BTS Put up the gun
BTS Fear was strong in their faces and the devilishness which comes of fear
BTS He was sounding the deeps of his nature and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he going back into the womb of Time
BTS But there was that in him deeper than all the law he had learned than the customs that had moulded him than his love for the master than the very will to live of himself
BTS It was a cheap and sordid thing after all this life and the sooner over the better
BTS After a sleepless night I arose weak and in agony to hobble through my second day on the Ghost
BTS You are well-rounded a blue-stocking fit to be the wife of a pirate chief
BTS Buck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell upon him
BTS White Fang snarling fiercely scrambled backward for several yards while Matt stooped and investigated his leg
BTS Topsails would be a nuisance and a danger for a crew of two so I heaved the topmasts on deck and lashed them fast
BTS It was as bold as his eyes
BTS I only wish you fellows knew a little something about evolution and sociology Ernest said wistfully as they shook hands
BTS That's just it she began eagerly and broke off in sudden confusion
BTS Could we but find time and opportunity and utilize the last bit and every bit of the unborn life that is in us we could become the fathers of nations and populate continents
BTS Stand ready for a call
BTS He alone rated himself beyond diamonds and rubies
BTS It had indeed been bloody for they had drawn off and joined our other three boats in the attack on the remaining two of the enemy
BTS Wicked men though they be they are certainly very much afraid of him
BTS cried the Bishop
BTS We were both very tired when we knocked off for supper and we had done good work too though to the eye it appeared insignificant
BTS On his back he carried half a sack of coal with kindling on top
BTS I read more than that I continued boldly
BTS while a dog thus overthrown invariably exposed for a moment the soft underside of its neck the vulnerable point at which to strike for its life
BTS I could weep for the poor creatures did I but forget poor old fat Louis and the troubles before him
BTS It is a parasitic growth that battens on the capitalist class
BTS He raged and snarled at them or lay quietly and studied them with cold hatred
BTS I have here a poem that tells the whole story
BTS It was because of her loss that she paid no attention to the winged bolt of the sky
BTS but with what was I to cover them
BTS We are consumed in our own flesh-pots
BTS It was the Wild still clinging to him asserting itself through him
BTS He is living more royally than any man for'ard though he does not know it
BTS He had been suddenly jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial
BTS He tried it with the ball of his thumb or across the nail
BTS Shark ho sir
BTS Do you mean to tell me that Jackson had the right on his side and yet was beaten
BTS He barely held his own one leap ahead of his pursuer
BTS And man has been achieving greater and greater combinations ever since
BTS I'm a-thinkin' that was the one I lambasted with the club
BTS to will but not to execute
BTS I don't know what but it is coming
BTS Of course we cannot prove this
BTS He smirked greasily up into the face of Wolf Larsen who seemed not to see him
BTS P
BTS See 'em alterin' the course
BTS I debated a moment looking him squarely in the eyes
BTS And half the night we sat up over it
BTS And to love and to wait and win love that surely was glorious enough for me
BTS It is coming now
BTS and so it was that he exalted what he deemed his mortality
BTS A second hand took form in the darkness beside it
BTS Good-bye Lucifer proud spirit Maud whispered so low that it was drowned by the shouting of the wind
BTS But when he was at last unearthed and Spitz flew at him to punish him Buck flew with equal rage in between
BTS We had a gambler's chance in the street but in here there is no chance at all
BTS My views are harsh
BTS Blows were struck and there were always two or three men nursing injuries at the hands of the human beast who was their master
BTS I mistered him and sirred him no longer washed no more greasy pots and peeled no more potatoes
BTS There must be some big men on board Hartman concluded
BTS In the second dog-watch the sailors come on deck stripped and heave buckets of water upon one another from overside
BTS In his own way he had told the truth when he said all were dead
BTS Fear sat upon him
BTS Nine years ago we socialists thought that law was aimed against labor
BTS But the effect upon White Fang was not to cow him
BTS Talk of a mess
BTS for I assure you I am not in the least angry
BTS It was an intolerable period of anxiety
BTS A common device of competition
BTS Maud who refused to stay alone ashore slept in the forecastle
BTS Leach was shouting
BTS Fear surged through him again
BTS Here and there Buck met Southland dogs but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed
BTS I am not fit dear brethren to tell you anything about morality
BTS Hartman and I had breakfast together in the dining car and I forced myself to eat
BTS They were irregular shapes and sizes
BTS and the chief outlet of expression that remained to him was in the allegiance he tendered the gods he had accepted as masters
BTS I fell to the floor feeling very faint while he sat down lighted a cigar and watched me as a cat watches a mouse
BTS Remember to-morrow is coming and you're so tired now that you can hardly stand
BTS We began with a particular industrial process the shoe factory
BTS I take it back
BTS Up to her old tricks she too had fled the inhospitable fires of the gods and gone back to her old refuge to give birth to her young
BTS After two efforts they stood still panting
BTS Oh that's all right that's all right the man hastened meekly to say
BTS and White Fang slunk away to the sheltering woods his head turned to observe as he glided softly over the ground
BTS He was seeing life in the raw and it was a different life from what he had known within the printed books of his library
BTS You are not exactly afraid
BTS Our failure so to report would be excused we knew in the light of subsequent events
BTS First she ate the dog-food
BTS Francois's whip snapped less frequently and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up his feet and carefully examining them
BTS When there is no pain I have perfect peace and quiet
BTS It was at the beginning of this movement that Garthwaite and I had encountered the young officer
BTS In the night-time after they had gone to roost he climbed to the top of a pile of newly hauled lumber
BTS His body thanks to his Scandinavian stock was fair as the fairest woman's
BTS The she-wolf had by now developed a ferocious temper
BTS As for this return to nature that you say you learned at college before I was born permit me to point out that on the face of it you cannot have learned anything since
BTS Nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp
BTS But they could hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river timber
BTS Among the Revolutionists were many surgeons and in vivisection they attained marvellous proficiency
BTS All de tam I watch dat Buck I know for sure
BTS The next moment I was being introduced to him as Mary Holmes
BTS But even as he reached and before his fingers had closed on the missile she sprang back into safety
BTS We squared away and ran for it
BTS Its nose was to the trail and it trotted with a peculiar sliding effortless gait
BTS No one had gone below and no one was speaking
BTS The clay of White Fang had been moulded until he became what he was morose and lonely unloving and ferocious the enemy of all his kind
BTS The situation was now reversed
BTS Oh only on the other side he added as though divining the suspicious glance I flung at his left leg the knee of which had just then drawn up and elevated the blankets
BTS All too quickly far more quickly than he had expected it happened
BTS The trail was in excellent condition well packed and hard and there was no new-fallen snow with which to contend
BTS I'll bushwhack her as sure as my name is Bill
BTS But Lip-lip was no longer leader except when he fled away before his mates at the end of his rope the sled bounding along behind
BTS he was demanding
BTS You merely questioned their morality
BTS What do they do to the poor men who are like me
BTS Man is a natural gambler and life is the biggest stake he can lay
BTS The power of subsidization of thought was theirs to a remarkable degree as I was soon to learn under Ernest's tuition
BTS At irregular intervals whenever a fight could be arranged he was taken out of his cage and led off into the woods a few miles from town
BTS He was a man beaten at birth
BTS The dog-musher laid his hand on Beauty Smith's shoulder and faced him to the right about
BTS There are still two billions to be accounted for which labor cannot buy back and consume
BTS Perforce in this enlightened age we have much to blush for in the acts of our ancestors
BTS The master was still in the cabin
BTS A gaping throat explained the manner of his death
BTS On the other hand the great helpless mass of the population the people of the abyss was sinking into a brutish apathy of content with misery
BTS He oppressed the weak with a vengeance
BTS redoubled
BTS That's not necessary
BTS You cannot be dogmatic with truth when you deal with me
BTS Murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up
BTS cried the other
BTS But to their nostrils came the myriad smells of an Indian camp carrying a story that was largely incomprehensible to One Eye but every detail of which the she-wolf knew
BTS They would rage around just outside the throwing-distance of the whip while Lip-lip devoured the meat and Mit-sah protected him
BTS He put his arms around me and kissed me and took it for granted that we should be married
BTS Bishop Morehouse nodded
BTS He lay down and waited while the porcupine grated its teeth and uttered grunts and sobs and occasional sharp little squeals
BTS Sometimes like to-day I am given eight pair to finish before night
BTS That is what we socialists are trying to bring about--the abolition of the conflict of interest
BTS In the afternoon while the cook was below asleep and I was peeling the everlasting potatoes Louis dropped into the galley for a yarn
BTS But the governments were taken away from them by the militant proletariat
BTS It was only next day when Wainwright Island loomed to windward close abeam that Wolf Larsen opened his mouth in prophecy
BTS It would be so much nicer if he would be friendly with us and help us
BTS On the other hand the unanimous affirmative answer will be that the return to nature and socialism are diametrically opposed to each other
BTS You must go aboard Humphrey and find out she said
BTS The Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal the like of which they had never seen before
BTS It was a sea-fitting for the buccaneers and pirates of by-gone years
BTS And now with the love-master his snuggling was the deliberate act of putting himself into a position of hopeless helplessness
BTS As he said Up above me I knew were unselfishnesses of the spirit clean and noble thinking keen intellectual living
BTS Numbers of the buildings held out over a week while one held out eleven days
BTS Her lines and fittings though I know nothing about such things speak for themselves
BTS Hump he said to me elaborately polite kindly take Mr
BTS for these were the very young and the very old the feeble and the sick the helpless and the hopeless all the wreckage of the ghetto
BTS I'm sorry sir
BTS They might have fought but even wooing and its rivalry waited upon the more pressing hunger-need of the pack
BTS So White Fang knew nothing of the heaven a man's hand might contain for him
BTS But this proof never got anywhere
BTS I roused at the first sound of his voice
BTS Wolf Larsen regarded me with smiling eyes
BTS Once again he lived in the lair with Kiche crept trembling to the knees of Grey Beaver to tender his allegiance ran for his life before Lip-lip and all the howling bedlam of the puppy-pack
BTS Thornton saw him coming and as Buck struck him like a battering ram with the whole force of the current behind him he reached up and closed with both arms around the shaggy neck
BTS There was a playfulness about her nips and a gentleness that prevented them from really hurting him
BTS As a sample of the decisions of the courts adverse to labor the following instances are given
BTS But you better speak soft with him
BTS You don't mean to say
BTS He stole a glance upward
BTS When I had gained the ladder I turned to the circle of brutal and malignant faces peering at me through the semi-darkness
BTS Thus in the early morning instead of roaming and foraging or lying in a sheltered nook he would wait for hours on the cheerless cabin-stoop for a sight of the god's face
BTS and you know that in the end they will destroy you take away from you the last per cent of your little profits
BTS We needed the sail for the boat and the tarpaulin had begun to leak
BTS There was no fight left in Lip-lip and he ran away shamelessly his victim hot on his heels and worrying him all the way back to his own tepee
BTS So large was the supply of things that a number of trips would be necessary to carry them to the refuge
BTS for in such way only I knew I could be stirred to shoot
BTS He started for the companion stairs but turned his head for a final word
BTS It made a lot of smoke but hurt no one except me
BTS Besides Maud begged me to heave to and I knew if the wind and sea increased at the same rate during the night that it would soon be impossible to heave to
BTS And so with me if I should exercise what little moral courage I may possess
BTS You cannot escape us
BTS I was jerked from swing to counter swing with irritating haste
BTS She is an old woman
BTS All passiveness and unconcern had dropped from them
BTS Next he dragged a dying woman over on top of me and with much squeezing and shoving crawled in beside me and partly over me
BTS We strolled across the poop to the lee side
BTS Hammerfield
BTS I looked instantly to Maud Brewster
BTS Growling savagely White Fang sprang out of the corner overturning the boy and the girl
BTS he queried a short while after
BTS It recovered its old-time solidarity and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the traces
BTS Had there been a steady breeze it would not have been so bad but the Ghost was rolling emptily in a long sea and with each roll the canvas flapped and boomed and the halyards slacked and jerked taut
BTS Events were rushing too rapidly to culmination
BTS Pertonwaithe's spacious walls beheld such a spectacle
BTS It was wide and heavy and protruded outward and down until it seemed to rest on his chest
BTS They learned that it was when a steamer first tied to the bank that they had their fun
BTS It was wanton slaughter and all for woman's sake
BTS He went about in it with greater confidence with a feeling of prowess that had not been his in the days before the battle with the lynx
BTS When I took the steering-oar I had first to unbend her cramped fingers
BTS It won't happen again
BTS My nerves were shocked
BTS I did it
BTS The first balloon missed the fortresses completely and disappeared into the country
BTS At the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp on the shore of Lake Le Barge
BTS She even went so far as to murmur that they were non-essentials and that my trip after them might be inexpedient
BTS You you  Go on Wolf Larsen prompted
BTS Just call up the firm Red 4451 I think it is and tell them what size and kind of glass you wish
BTS Half the men forward are deep-water sailors and their excuse is that they did not know anything about her or her captain
BTS to decline
BTS The 'Frisco Reds pledged themselves to his execution
BTS I'm doing it now
BTS I worked seventeen years in them mills an' I've took notice that most of the accidents happens just before whistle-blow
BTS This man was called Beauty by the other men of the fort
BTS I shouted when I thought it was meet to arouse Maud
BTS And you've been shooting off your mouth about them
BTS Van Weyden there he replied nodding to me with a mischievous twinkle
BTS At the same time he flung the coil of rope
BTS Well
BTS I asked
BTS A lynx's lair is not despoiled with impunity
BTS They don't love us an' bloody well glad they'd be a-seein' us cuttin' our throats
BTS the true
BTS I was struck a crushing stunning blow nowhere in particular and yet everywhere
BTS We bought our groceries from them
BTS We surely are not to expect some wildly romantic sea-story from your sober pen
BTS The law was a puppet with which he played
BTS An endless creaking was going on all about me the woodwork and the fittings groaning and squeaking and complaining in a thousand keys
BTS Also he was desperate
BTS But when the ends of the rope were placed in the stranger's hands he growled menacingly
BTS We live only a stone's throw away
BTS If we could put a couple of shots into 'em they'd be more respectful
BTS and it was they in turn that later became that terrible weapon of the Oligarchy the agents- provocateurs
BTS In the interest of meeting the other guests and what of my unfavorable impression I forgot all about the working-class philosopher though once or twice at table I noticed him--especially the twinkle in his eye as he listened to the talk first of one minister and then of another
BTS I noticed at the same time that the Kanaka's knuckles were laid open clear across and to the bone
BTS Any of you fellows got a Bible or Prayer-book
BTS It is a true indictment
BTS The boiler exploded down at the works
BTS It was drastic
BTS It is supposed that it was warmly seasoned
BTS He did not know anything about entrances passages whereby one goes from one place to another place
BTS the other thundered with abrupt fierceness
BTS The air was thick with flying wreckage detached ropes and stays were hissing and coiling like snakes and down through it all crashed the gaff of the foresail
BTS Suddenly I became aware of him leaning back from the table and listening curiously to our alien speech of a world he did not know
BTS When I asked him if he had broken some rule of working the machinery he shook his head
BTS With it we would repel the invasion of the regular army
BTS Oppression sat heavily upon them
BTS The two men looked at each other
BTS It was no light running now nor record time but heavy toil each day with a heavy load behind
BTS All my wrongs and humiliations flashed upon me with a dazzling brightness all that I had suffered and others had suffered at his hands all the enormity of the man's very existence
BTS That's a steam-siren a-goin' it over there to the left
BTS Their husbands you know are the two principal stockholders in the Mills
BTS Then it was that Beauty Smith had talk with him again about the sale of White Fang
BTS Like his mates he was barely able to get up but unlike them he had made up his mind not to get up
BTS That will be a good name for that despotism the Iron Heel
BTS Walk over and examine those lanyards he said pointing to where the mizzen-rigging should have been
BTS The fear of death for myself and for others left me
BTS The old-party orators were usually greeted with empty halls though occasionally they encountered full halls where they were so roughly handled that more than once it was necessary to call out the police reserves
BTS It's the best I can do for you sir
BTS Ain't the slightest doubt in the world was Henry's response
BTS And what is he
BTS So next day the hunting began
BTS I was beneath the water suffocating and drowning
BTS So you're afraid eh
BTS The middle class owns twenty-four billions
BTS Wolf Larsen was my captain Thomas Mugridge and the rest were my companions and I was receiving repeated impresses from the die which had stamped them all
BTS It is exceeded in the world only by the Bank of England and the Bank of France
BTS Never mind the preamble
BTS At the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand
BTS The man waited in vain for them to go
BTS They were as dead men in their comrades' eyes and between them was the gulf that parts the living and the dead
BTS The seals could depart on their mysterious journey into the south at any time now for all we cared
BTS but the blood she had lost had taken with it her strength and for all of a day and a night she lay by her dead foe's side without movement scarcely breathing
BTS We stopped the war with Germany
BTS But more things and most grievous ones were happening with equal suddenness
BTS Oh Henry
BTS Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights
BTS But the next moment two of Ernest's statements came flashing into my consciousness The company employs very efficient lawyers and Colonel Ingram is a shrewd lawyer
BTS Yes thank you for the word all my brutishness but he can scarcely read or write
BTS Van Weyden was Wolf Larsen's command
BTS Where's Maud
BTS At once he became an enigma
BTS Like other men they passed out of Buck's life for good
BTS She looked me bravely in the eyes
BTS an' I wouldn't do it over for a thousand cold cash
BTS Bill had already gone from sight
BTS Little more I saw of the Chicago Commune
BTS This was a surprise to many of the revolutionists
BTS Nor was he slow in advertising the fact
BTS It is a plot
BTS Nothing much he began slowly except that the gown you wear is stained with blood
BTS Then why did you advise father to accept the vacation
BTS I could see that he knew what had made me possibly as sick as Harrison that he was trying to draw me and I answered It was because of the brutal treatment of that boy
BTS But listen to that will you
BTS But God has forsaken you small capitalists
BTS Henry queried
BTS When he dozed despite himself the whimpering and snarling of the dogs aroused him
BTS I heard her words with a responsive thrill it was all so dearly intimate and natural and I said It seems as though I have lived this life always
BTS I looked with misgiving toward the south-west and thought of the six hundred miles of hardship before us ay if it were no worse than hardship
BTS He knew that he was doing the right thing by holding on and there came to him certain blissful thrills of satisfaction
BTS I have an income I answered stoutly and could have bitten my tongue the next instant
BTS The halyards slackened and though it all happened very quickly I could see them sag beneath the weight of his body
BTS They shook their heads and some one made a jocular remark which I did not catch but which raised a general laugh
BTS Then the three writhed together in a swaying tangle struggling sliding and falling into the arms of their mates on the crosstrees
BTS He had not been born right and he had not been helped any by the moulding he had received at the hands of society
BTS The door would open and thrust in upon him would come the awful electric car
BTS Jones and Philip Ward who had already risen from their chairs led the Bishop off the platform while the audience sat breathless and shocked
BTS The United States is a capitalist country that has developed its resources
BTS But what scenes of hell the Bishop's eyes had seen I knew not for he seemed too stunned to speak about them
BTS With a large business there is always less waste and greater efficiency
BTS The same conditions obtained in the nineteenth century A
BTS He held steadily on his way
BTS And when it did get its teeth into him it did not hold on but let go instantly and darted away again
BTS But the dead man was unconcerned
BTS Not at all
BTS In the industrial warfare of that time profit-sharing had been tried
BTS I don't understand I lied for I thoroughly understood
BTS Casting off the shore-lines I kedged her out by main strength the windlass being broken till she rode nearly up and down to the small anchor too small to hold her in any breeze
BTS Of his own choice he came in to sit by man's fire and to be ruled by him
BTS Every community was as completely isolated as though ten thousand miles of primeval wilderness stretched between it and the rest of the world
BTS Some sailor he told me had laid hold of it by his teeth at the beginning of the fight and hung on and been dragged to the top of the forecastle ladder when he was kicked loose
BTS Ere he landed on his feet he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before
BTS He did not pause to worry the victim but ripped in passing with the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man
BTS He sprang to the side
BTS If I were Mr
BTS Such high souls are made for crucifixion
BTS All life likes power and Beauty Smith was no exception
BTS Owen murmured We would not go into the militia
BTS A panic seized him and he ran madly toward the village
BTS Blows were falling on me
BTS I have lived in shame and hypocrisies too long to be able to help others
BTS yet all the time I shall be here alive active and powerless
BTS His quietness under the circumstances was terrible
BTS Hammerfield taunted him
BTS Of course I would he cried angrily
BTS and the especially acceptable brands are acceptable because they do not menace the established order of society
BTS It is true one cannot eat much when there is no work
BTS Bill had finished his pipe and was helping his companion to spread the bed of fur and blanket upon the spruce boughs which he had laid over the snow before supper
BTS But I didn't tell my wife
BTS He really never crystallized mentally
BTS His jaws let go their grip and he leaped backward to escape this strange danger his lips drawn back from his fangs his throat snarling every hair bristling with rage and fright
BTS I agree with you heartily he answered
BTS You preach what you believe
BTS But he was trapped amid the palms and rubber trees
BTS A decade before this speech of Everhard's the New York Board of Trade issued a report from which the following is quoted The railroads control absolutely the legislatures of a majority of the states of the Union
BTS As Buck drew himself together to spring after them out of the tail of his eye he saw Spitz rush upon him with the evident intention of overthrowing him
BTS But he was anything save a beauty
BTS It seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins
BTS They were stars I knew and flaring comets that peopled my flight among the suns
BTS Of course I began if you prefer  But what shall I be doing
BTS No man can be intellectually insulted
BTS It was some of the blood from that arm that I heard dripping from your roof-beams Ernest said with continued gentleness
BTS These women capable of the most sublime emotions of the tenderest sympathies were open-mouthed and screaming
BTS He revelled in the vengeance he wreaked upon his kind
BTS He stood gazing stupidly across at White Fang the raw red shin-bone between them
BTS The tooth of every dog was against him the hand of every man
BTS And here may well end the story of Buck
BTS I asked the maid in the dressing-room how late the train was and she told me two hours
BTS Don't be afraid of my feelings
BTS 'Tell me are you happy
BTS I came back to the bag afterward an' got 'm his fish
BTS At the first step upon the cold surface Buck's feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud
BTS I know
BTS Occasional light airs were felt however and Wolf Larsen patrolled the poop constantly his eyes ever searching the sea to the north-eastward from which direction the great trade-wind must blow
BTS We want all that you possess
BTS He could do nothing and he could not understand
BTS I watched him breathing carefully so that he should not hear me
BTS Even at that time I flattered myself that I played some part in causing his visits and it was not long before I learned the correctness of my surmise
BTS He snarled involuntarily as he felt her teeth in his shoulder but beyond this made no offer to hurt her
BTS Good-bye Matt old man
BTS And that great humanist Abraham Lincoln said just before his assassination I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country
BTS Many events are focussed sharply on my brain but between these indelible pictures I retain are intervals of unconsciousness
BTS I stood still in trepidation
BTS Out of this pack-persecution he learned two important things how to take care of himself in a mass-fight against him and how on a single dog to inflict the greatest amount of damage in the briefest space of time
BTS I looked at Maud
BTS There was no need for him to go and see what had happened
BTS and not only that for his features as human features at all were unrecognizable so discoloured and swollen had they become in the few minutes which had elapsed between the beginning of the beating and the dragging forward of the body
BTS Well
BTS But the cook was after me shouting through the lee galley door 'Ere you
BTS Then some deep-water sailor from the waist of the ship lifted a rich tenor voice in the Song of the Trade Wind Oh I am the wind the seamen love  I am steady and strong and true
BTS It was a strength I had not possessed a few months before on the day I said good-bye to Charley Furuseth and started for San Francisco on the ill-fated Martinez
BTS And very quietly he smelled the air and read the message it bore of a strange god's presence
BTS What I don't know
BTS Henry called after him
BTS He was in perfect condition without an ounce of superfluous flesh and the one hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit and virility
BTS The crime at the time was openly charged to the mine owners by the socialists and miners
BTS It is very simple
BTS It breaks off abruptly in the middle of a sentence
BTS But father was nothing if not a scientist
BTS Since it was to be done let it be done with despatch
BTS A collision with the table partially knocked the wind from my body and brought me to myself
BTS He raised himself on his flippers with an angry movement
BTS and father had only laughed at him for his pains
BTS he asked
BTS In the end he worked out the complete law
BTS Thomas Mugridge backed away glaring as hatefully and viciously as I glared
BTS To get it patented to make money from it to revel in piggishness with all night in while other men do the work
BTS Sometimes the revolver shots drowned the voices of Garthwaite and the officer and they were compelled to repeat what they had been saying
BTS The metaphysician reasons deductively out of his own subjectivity
BTS In no time I was on the bottom
BTS He took no notice of me
BTS His primacy was savage and savagely he ruled administering justice with a club punishing transgression with the pain of a blow and rewarding merit not by kindness but by withholding a blow
BTS I guess you can come an' get me any time he mumbled
BTS It was because nothing daunted him that he had been chosen for government courier
BTS CHAPTER IV THE WALL OF THE WORLD By the time his mother began leaving the cave on hunting expeditions the cub had learned well the law that forbade his approaching the entrance
BTS All about me was the same movement
BTS It was his mate who relieved him from the quandary in which he found himself
BTS Because I am solid and stolid and selfish
BTS And when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away
BTS White Fang saw his mother taken aboard Three Eagles' canoe and tried to follow her
BTS The right of masters to dispose of the time of their slaves has been distinctly recognized by the Creator of all things who is surely at liberty to vest the right of property over any object whomsoever He pleases
BTS And your branch store absorbed the profits of the three small ones
BTS I wisht they'd spring up a bunch of moose or something an' go away an' leave us alone Bill said
BTS It means that the United States is coming to own railroads in Brazil factories mines and lands in Brazil
BTS It's what I should have done at first I answered hugely disgusted with myself
BTS We will grind you revolutionists down under our heel and we shall walk upon your faces
BTS When I finished he had me read it over a second time and a third
BTS It was the maker of the track a large female lynx
BTS It was an even toss whether the shark or we would get him and it was a matter of moments
BTS Careful as you go
BTS He studied the nail-formation and prodded the finger-tips now sharply and again softly gauging the while the nerve-sensations produced
BTS and in the centre of the clearing stood Buck motionless as a statue waiting their coming
BTS And the pang of new-born jealousy put all incredulity to flight
BTS It was the time of the famine and there was no meat for the dogs
BTS Denied their usual food-supply weakened by hunger they fell upon and devoured one another
BTS There was no sound
BTS He it was who had dragged me out and saved me
BTS It was this automatic assumption of a role that was considered imperative
BTS He stood staring after her for a minute then returned to himself and to me
BTS It was bottom up and there was no sign of its crew
BTS Calling us weak does not make you stronger in the face of the strength of the Plutocracy Ernest retorted
BTS The man in the red sweater had proved that
BTS So come to-night
BTS At such moments when his dogs snarled the whole circle would be agitated the wolves coming to their feet and pressing tentatively forward a chorus of snarls and eager yelps rising about him
BTS And others were exasperated too and some were smiling in an amused and superior way
BTS Three were short-haired pointers one was a Newfoundland and the other two were mongrels of indeterminate breed
BTS Indeed it was a safe refuge
BTS My mother and sisters were always about me and I was always trying to escape them
BTS Often one pair is all I can get
BTS Impelled by the blows that rained upon him now from this side now from that White Fang swung back and forth like an erratic and jerky pendulum
BTS The Preacher who was king over Israel in Jerusalem thought as I think
BTS Everything now went smoothly
BTS Let me point out the power of but one of them the railroad group
BTS It's a circle
BTS But this vindication did not satisfy
BTS The light had become painfully bright
BTS By midday though we were well up in the northerly latitudes the heat was sickening
BTS Light came at nine o'clock
BTS It had taken Cherokee a long time to shift that grip upward and this had also tended further to clog his jaws with fur and skin-fold
BTS As it was it made me quite squeamish though this nausea might have been due to the pain of my leg and exhaustion
BTS Did it right before me
BTS I'll try to tell you why not though the telling will be rather hard
BTS I sat down on the hatch-combing and rested my chin on my hands in black despair
BTS In this battle the middle class has no place
BTS Stick to it
BTS He could die dumb-mad and fighting to the last but he could not live and be beaten
BTS On the other hand instead of having to devote my energy to the learning of a multitude of things I concentrated it upon a few particular things such as for instance the analysis of Poe's place in American literature an essay of mine by the way in the current Atlantic
BTS Civilized he could have died for a moral consideration say the defence of Judge Miller's riding-whip
BTS Sparkling points of light spluttered and shot past me
BTS Oh nothing Wolf Larsen said lamely
BTS A pretty mess that 'Frisco whisky got me into an' a prettier mess that woman's got you into aft there
BTS I'm all right
BTS And after all delight is the wage for living
BTS In three hours it was midnight I well remember and as dark as I had ever seen it on the sea the wind still blowing out of the south-west rose furiously and once again I was compelled to set the sea-anchor
BTS She regarded him with amazement unconcealed
BTS They sought no farther
BTS This spirit had infected the Mercenaries of which three regiments in particular were ready to come over to us en masse
BTS He lay where he had fallen and from there he watched the man in the red sweater
BTS Go on home and tell them what's happened to me
BTS They were alert and active anxious that the work should go well and fiercely irritable with whatever by delay or confusion retarded that work
BTS Henry squatting over the fire and settling the pot of coffee with a piece of ice nodded
BTS Buck retreated two or three steps
BTS And at first I thought he had some show too
BTS for I want you a few thousand miles away from here
BTS Harrison clinging on made the giddy rush through the air
BTS I shall not take any risks I said
BTS It was a saturnalia
BTS But why didn't you
BTS the body of the lord and master was sacred not to be defiled by the teeth of such as he
BTS He looked appealingly around the table but no one answered for him
BTS It's got away with three of our dogs an' we oughter put a stop to it
BTS that manufacturers have deliberately provoked strikes in order to get rid of surplus stock
BTS Immortality is a thing without beginning or end
BTS And then boastingly We work from the time we are born until we die in my country
BTS From pavement to pavement and covering the sidewalks it lay there spread out quite evenly with only here and there a lump or mound of bodies to break the surface
BTS and second by climbing out the peak-halyards to the end of the gaff itself an exceedingly hazardous performance
BTS Every man aboard with the exception of Johansen who is rather overcome by his promotion seems to have an excuse for having sailed on the Ghost
BTS Here a squat and brawny god held sway with much noise hurling trunks and boxes about dragging them in through the door and tossing them into the piles or flinging them out of the door smashing and crashing to other gods who awaited them
BTS The cabin-boy and he weighed one hundred and sixty-five at the very least crumpled up
BTS Then we raced and wildly across the wild sea the while I hung like a fly in the crosstrees and searched for the other boats
BTS and those meals
BTS They scattered far and wide over the country and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses
BTS He became malignant and morose
BTS I ground my teeth in my anger and determination till the man I was attending winced under my hand and Oofty-Oofty looked at me with curiosity
BTS It is so much more beautiful
BTS It is good for one to possess it
BTS Buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of murmured oaths and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy
BTS it will all come right
BTS It was a simple war of the castes Coolie versus Samurai and the coolie socialists were executed by tens of thousands
BTS We cannot but marvel at Everhard's foresight
BTS And while the whole face was the incarnation of fierceness and strength the primal melancholy from which he suffered seemed to greaten the lines of mouth and eye and brow seemed to give a largeness and completeness which otherwise the face would have lacked
BTS You must come now
BTS The dog-musher indicated White Fang with a backward thrust of his thumb
BTS Your hands are soft with the work others have performed for you
BTS My man she said looking at me for an instant with tremulous lids which fluttered down and veiled her eyes as she snuggled her head against my breast with a happy little sigh
BTS Henry I'm a-thinkin' Bill announced
BTS They are dead
BTS And in that moment the sapling reared its slender length upright and the rabbit soared dancing in the air again
BTS Six cents for finishing
BTS The Ghost seemed to start into life as she heeled to the first fill of her sails
BTS But of Leach's behaviour By the time I had finished cleansing the cabin he had taken care of Johnson
BTS And so I was kept in touch with all that was happening in the world without
BTS At such moments I felt strangely alone with God alone with him and watching the chaos of his wrath
BTS There were artists scientists scholars musicians and poets among us
BTS I feel it
BTS And they've about all the escaping they want I said
BTS I could imagine he was speaking the thoughts of his own mind as he read to me and his voice reverberating deeply and mournfully in the confined cabin charmed and held me
BTS Here it is The silver trumpets rang across the Dome
BTS At once he became a thing of the wild stealing along softly cat-footed a passing shadow that appeared and disappeared among the shadows
BTS She seemed to me like a being from another world
BTS She made no reply and I knew my tone must have hurt her
BTS His muzzle was the long wolf muzzle save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf
BTS The oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him
BTS There were both partners of the big drug firm of Kowalt  Washburn and Mr
BTS Wolf Larsen shouted after
BTS Instead of crossing the street I hurried after the man
BTS Her temper was now shorter than ever
BTS and I smiled as I saw a copy of The Dean's English
BTS Whether it was my love for Ernest or the clear sight he had given me of the society in which I lived that made me a revolutionist I know not
BTS Of course there was no hope for him not the slightest and he knew it as well as I but by the manhood that was in him he could not cease from fighting for that manhood
BTS There was a smack of success in her words
BTS Splay hoofs and palmated antlers they knew and they flung their customary patience and caution to the wind
BTS He interrupted her when she gave the lines And her eyes should be my light while the sun went out behind me And the viols in her voice be the last sound in my ear
BTS I caught him under the shoulders and dragged him to the companion-way
BTS We were not making more than nine knots but the fog-bank was very near
BTS It's chaos
BTS What I am striving to express is this strength itself more as a thing apart from his physical semblance
BTS Where did you go to school
BTS So convincing was all this misrepresentation that even sincere ministers in the pulpit praised the Black Hundreds while regretting the necessity of violence
BTS The two girls arrived in a flurry of excitement danger and sudden death
BTS Yes they're quarrelling over the division of the earnings of the street railways
BTS I have listened carefully and there is only one name that will epitomize you
BTS Wilcox was the superannuated president of the university whose withered mind was stored with generalizations that were young in 1870 and which he had since failed to revise
BTS He studied her his eyes rarely leaving her face unless to follow the movements of her hands or shoulders
BTS Under some pretext after the girls had landed at Petaluma Creek and taken to the horses he managed to get away from the boat
BTS Mebbe you'll need that in your business Henry said
BTS They're gettin' anxious up there
BTS Also he worked at odd jobs and the work was play as well as learned investigation for he delighted in it and was always returning home with copious notes and bubbling over with new adventures
BTS Oh ask him  She hesitated
BTS We cannot follow you
BTS The destruction of the Roman yeomanry proceeded far less rapidly than the destruction of the American farmers and small capitalists
BTS but at such times Mit-sah would throw the stinging lash of the thirty-foot cariboo-gut whip into his face and compel him to turn tail and run on
BTS Even the labor castes of the city were alive with revolt
BTS It is our lives against theirs
BTS I shouted at her harshly
BTS What is the cause of the merriment
BTS Gif it to heem the dirty t'eef
BTS She had not raised her voice and yet I was struck by its clear and bell-like tone
BTS Of course they saw nothing of the sort
BTS The old man'll be wantin' yer on deck an' this ayn't no d'y to fall foul of 'im
BTS You must have been overboard sir
BTS That is the meaning of the capitalist system
BTS In the late spring a great trouble came to White Fang
BTS Did you feel that
BTS My pocketbook is stuffed with the old coinage and it's a stubborn thing
BTS Thomas Mugridge demanded a moment later
BTS Then it is good to be an anarchist
BTS Why we'll be clamorous for something to do
BTS They will not count
BTS And there was a smell in the air of fish
BTS There is no discussion of this I am sure
BTS I have no experience
BTS And so terribly did he live this vendetta that Grey Beaver fierce savage himself could not but marvel at White Fang's ferocity
BTS And as I faced him with levelled gun shaking in my hands I had time to note the worn and haggard appearance of his face
BTS It's up to the editors
BTS We had been having a heated discussion upon life of course and grown over-bold I was passing stiff strictures upon Wolf Larsen and the life of Wolf Larsen
BTS After several experiences White Fang never stopped without orders
BTS From your own figures we of the middle class are more powerful than labor Mr
BTS He began to notice near objects an open portion of the stream that flashed in the sun the blasted pine-tree that stood at the base of the slope and the slope itself that ran right up to him and ceased two feet beneath the lip of the cave on which he crouched
BTS That is unconstitutional
BTS Kowalt
BTS I spoke stoutly but I did not believe a word
BTS There's too much of the schoolboy in me
BTS Three-quarters of a million of miners went out on strike
BTS She's a-comin'
BTS There is not a man aboard but hates or fears him nor is there a man whom he does not despise
BTS Had the porcupine been entirely unrolled or had it not discovered its enemy a fraction of a second before the blow was struck the paw would have escaped unscathed
BTS You are a pauper
BTS But it was not altogether an unhappy bondage
BTS Callous as they were to my suffering they were equally callous to their own when anything befell them
BTS And we to-day looking back across the centuries can safely say that even had he lived the Second Revolt would not have been less calamitous in its outcome than it was
BTS In short when all things were considered he had to achieve an orientation far vaster than the one he had achieved at the time he came voluntarily in from the Wild and accepted Grey Beaver as his lord
BTS Do you see this
BTS You have no right to put temptation in the way of your fellow-creatures
BTS The only crime of Moyer and Haywood is that they have been unswervingly true to the working class
BTS All right
BTS He had sunk down on the snow in the circle of his blood and was plainly in the last gasp
BTS It is the race heritage the sadness which has made the race sober-minded clean-lived and fanatically moral and which in this latter connection has culminated among the English in the Reformed Church and Mrs
BTS This the Iron Heel foresaw and laid its schemes accordingly
BTS He nodded his head with a savage pleasantness
BTS Bill grunted his disagreement with the diagnosis and lapsed into silence
BTS You and I are the only men on this ship who know its meaning
BTS You have not answered
BTS He did not go down again
BTS I don't think they'd insure me at all
BTS It was said he had not seen his own feet in years
BTS While he was fighting off two or three it was disappearing down the throats of the others
BTS The strange god walked softly but more softly walked White Fang for he had no clothes to rub against the flesh of his body
BTS The mastiff shook his head growled hoarsely and plunged at White Fang
BTS As fiction those morning papers of October 27th were masterpieces
BTS but I found that I was now looking on it for the first time
BTS The huskies had chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings
BTS The capitalist system will fall to pieces
BTS he merely lived the law without thinking about it at all
BTS Humphrey Van Weyden the cold-blooded fish the emotionless monster the analytical demon of Charley Furuseth's christening in love
BTS Their homes were palaces
BTS Thus we landed on Endeavour Island as we came to it land-sick from long custom of the sea
BTS If for no other reason the memory of my poor old father and the way he was worked to death would prevent
BTS By this time he had become the centre of interest
BTS The thunder of the streets smote upon his ears
BTS One of the men was General Altendorff
BTS So I tucked a blanket and pillow under my arm and went up on deck
BTS It was the colossal bulk of them that impressed him
BTS This tirade against destiny went on for an hour or more and then he buckled to his work limping and groaning and in his eyes a great hatred for all created things
BTS We agreed that the average man is selfish
BTS In spite of his fear at the reckoning he must expect to pay for what he had done he could see that it had been an object-lesson to me and he became more domineering and exultant
BTS Emotional delight is followed by no more than jaded senses which speedily recuperate
BTS The men remained grouped amidships
BTS And his comrades called him a calamity howler
BTS And now we are no longer travelling toward Japan I answered
BTS All his bluster had gone and he seemed to have caught the contagion of preternatural calm
BTS Silently without flinching he took a second cut in his forward rush and as he leaped for the throat the groom cried out My God
BTS I had stepped underneath the open hatchway so that I could see him
BTS The eyes themselves were of that baffling protean grey which is never twice the same
BTS Possibly he had seen men towed before
BTS It was good that men should be specialists I mused
BTS Unfortunately when running free it is impossible to lash the wheel so I faced an all-night watch
BTS This he took in good part and was really pleased nodding his head with direful foreknowledge and mystery until George Leach the erstwhile cabin-boy ventured some rough pleasantry on the subject
BTS Here and there whole districts were still in possession of the comrades but such districts were surrounded and guarded by heavy bodies of troops
BTS The gun was on the way to his shoulder but it never got there
BTS We explain the nature of the conflict of interest that produces the class struggle
BTS But the hunger-madness made them terrifying irresistible
BTS Plainly I read between the lines that our plot had been discovered that we had been countermined
BTS Buck had sprung in on the instant
BTS They went away together leaving me smarting with a sense of injustice that had been done me and my class
BTS but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater the death of Curly the great fight with Spitz and the good things he had eaten or would like to eat
BTS The puppy sprawled in front of him
BTS Gallantly they did
BTS I'll wait for a dead sure shot was the reply
BTS Now and again men came strangers who talked excitedly wheedlingly and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater
BTS Van Weyden fore and aft and it was only unofficially that Wolf Larsen himself ever addressed me as Hump
BTS The other Indians laughed loudly and urged the man on to pick up the cub
BTS I slept only cat-naps
BTS For the possession of a flesh-and-blood god he exchanged his own liberty
BTS There was furthermore another virtue in the fan-formation
BTS I won't stand it he said
BTS Was he a coward
BTS while to show mercy was a weakness
BTS On the other hand there was something about him that prevented great familiarity
BTS It was introduced by Representative Dick of Ohio
BTS Outside the pen men would be gathering and he knew that a fight was on
BTS What are you doing down there
BTS From regarding me curiously he turned his head and glanced out over the leaden sea to windward
BTS That night when supper was finished and they sat on the oblong box and pulled at their pipes the circle of gleaming eyes drew in even closer than before
BTS Maud released the hand
BTS And furthermore the trusts control the markets
BTS Not but that I was afloat in a safe craft for the Martinez was a new ferry-steamer making her fourth or fifth trip on the run between Sausalito and San Francisco
BTS Are you  I began
BTS But there is only so much gold and not much of it in the world Ernest objected
BTS she asked
BTS I had not yet had a glimmering of unconsciousness and it seemed that an interminable period of time was lapsing before I heard her feet flying back
BTS In spite of the bad weather and of the wind which especially hindered me I was on deck from daylight till dark and making substantial progress
BTS It was a simple affair now to go forth in the morning and return by noon with a boatload of seals
BTS Of course this overproduction he mentions was the profits of the capitalist system over and beyond the consuming power of the capitalists
BTS and small manufacturers and farmers to-day are reduced to all intents and purposes to feudal tenure
BTS and that all their days they fester in brutality and viciousness and in the end die as unlovely as they have lived
BTS Asmunsen answered sadly
BTS She could not fly in the face of the gods who permitted him but that did not prevent her from making life miserable for him in petty ways
BTS said Maud
BTS A German Jew of the nineteenth century
BTS Don't you think you've stretched that neck of yours just about enough
BTS Yet it was a secret growth
BTS He was afraid of them
BTS A kind word a caressing touch of the hand on the part of Grey Beaver might have sounded these deeps
BTS He set sail and bore away into the west-north-west two hunters constantly at the mastheads and sweeping the sea with glasses himself pacing the deck like an angry lion
BTS As Buck sprang to punish him the lash of Francois's whip sang through the air reaching the culprit first
BTS Yes
BTS Making this tackle fast I took to the windlass the shears-tackle which was connected with the end of the boom and with a few turns had the mast perpendicular and clear
BTS Flying-fish are beginning to be seen and during the night the watch above scrambles over the deck in pursuit of those that fall aboard
BTS White Fang scanned him apprehensively when he came out
BTS The same shirt and he hasn't had it off once in all this time
BTS And she was so much the woman clinging and appealing sunshine and dew to my manhood rooting it deeper and sending through it the sap of a new strength
BTS One string he tied around the throat of Kiche
BTS This with a gratified smile
BTS Asmunsen replied curtly
BTS It was a clumsy way but it did not take long and soon the foresail as well was up and fluttering
BTS Of all our Fighting Groups this one was the most formidable ferocious and merciless
BTS There was soon literally no field of industry where their millions were not at work
BTS Deep in him below any reasoning process or act of consciousness he had associated power with godhead
BTS At once the sapling shot up and after that gave no more trouble remaining in the decorous and perpendicular position in which nature had intended it to grow
BTS but the next moment in a rush of anger he was upon Lip-lip and snapping viciously
BTS If trouble comes will you stand by
BTS Wolf Larsen stooped coolly to the Cockney and pressed with thumb and finger at the rear of the jaws and below the ears
BTS I remembered Charley Furuseth and knew this man's sadness as the penalty which the materialist ever pays for his materialism
BTS To me death had always been invested with solemnity and dignity
BTS Yet he continued to fear and he stood on guard expectant of unguessed evil alternately suffering and enjoying as one feeling or the other came uppermost and swayed him
BTS It was amusing
BTS But we did not know it at the time
BTS The sun had come back and all the awakening Northland world was calling to him
BTS This bit of the ferment we call Johnson' when he is no longer a bit of the ferment only dust and ashes will have no more nobility than any dust and ashes while I shall still be alive and roaring
BTS But in the confusion I managed to crawl into an empty lower bunk out of the way
BTS It simply means that in the attack on my brain the higher psychical centres are untouched
BTS He stood watching and waiting
BTS True and you will grant that capital would perish if there were no labor to earn the dividends
BTS Then at twilight came John Carlson who demanded Wickson's shoes
BTS Look the matter in the face and state it in direct terms
BTS I did return not long ago but unfortunately the skippers were dead all but one a mate in the old days a skipper when I met him and when I left him a cripple who would never walk again
BTS You can depend upon it that they're holding them like this thirty or forty miles outside the city on every road
BTS It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work
BTS If you were a grocery trust for the whole United States you would be singing another song
BTS Certainly he answered
BTS Subjugation meant death for no quarter was given and they fought heroically to the last man
BTS Hal had traded off his revolver so he took the axe and knocked Billee on the head as he lay in the traces then cut the carcass out of the harness and dragged it to one side
BTS Yet this endurance he achieved
BTS There had been no reservation on White Fang's part and the bond was not to be broken easily
BTS We were out of the Trades and the Ghost was forging ahead barely a knot an hour
BTS I could almost have shrieked and flown at his throat with my naked hands before his final cold-blooded instructions were given
BTS There was no freshness in the air
BTS But don't make the mistake of under-estimating me
BTS He was all interested attention and waited for me to go on though I could see in his eyes the certitude that my convictions had been shaken
BTS Calvin and the rest of the dairymen
BTS It was a clarion-call that thrilled me
BTS I could catch glimpses of my face white and ghastly distorted with pain in the cabin mirror
BTS Now what do you say
BTS And then there were our sweet stolen moments in the midst of our work--just a word or caress or flash of love-light
BTS Calhoun said A power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves consisting of many and various and powerful interests combined into one mass and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks
BTS Then he sallied forth
BTS The Black Hundreds are being organized in the United States he said
BTS When I emerged on deck it seemed that the end of everything had come
BTS You'll find it knockin' about by the bitts Leach said sitting down on the edge of the bunk in which I was concealed
BTS Again I fled to the boat hotly pursued
BTS My headache was gone but body and soul I was very tired
BTS I pointed out to you the wretchedness of modern man--three million child slaves in the United States without whose labor profits would not be possible and fifteen million under-fed ill-clothed and worse-housed people
BTS His eyes were wide and staring and he was trembling violently
BTS Them hunters is the wicked boys he broke forth again for he suffered from a constitutional plethora of speech
BTS Remember he said in a voice that made itself heard above the din that as you show mercy now to the proletariat some day will that same proletariat show mercy to you
BTS I called repeatedly but was denied access to him
BTS and men mere motes of light and sparkle cursed with an insane relish for work riding their steeds of wood and steel through the heart of the mystery groping their way blindly through the Unseen and clamouring and clanging in confident speech the while their hearts are heavy with incertitude and fear
BTS He seemed possessed by an insatiable fury which gave no time for grief
BTS His mother verified it
BTS There is such a thing as moral courage and moral courage is never without effect
BTS The steerage told the same tale as the forecastle
BTS The sharp clang of a passing ambulance at the corner gave him a start
BTS Dr
BTS It was well that it was arranged for by evening his voice had gone from him
BTS Avaricious farmers hunted him with shot-guns
BTS It ran lightly on the surface of the snow while the dogs ploughed through by main strength
BTS He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem
BTS You've discovered your own and learned to stand on them
BTS From time to time I forsook my own thoughts to follow him and I followed in amaze mastered for the moment by his remarkable intellect under the spell of his passion for he was preaching the passion of revolt
BTS If our friends could see us now she said
BTS As he told me the Ghost is an eighty-ton schooner of a remarkably fine model
BTS But his reputation was made and from that day his name spread through every camp in Alaska
BTS Symons's lines came into my head I wandered all these years among A world of women seeking you
BTS It seems to me if we find where they haul out  It seems to me that your fighting instinct is aroused I laughed
BTS So I was not altogether surprised when the squall foretold by Louis smote me
BTS And even as they eased him down upon the blankets his snores were rising on the frosty air
BTS I shrugged my shoulders
BTS Yes those who work in the shop get eight cents
BTS Ernest demanded
BTS And you won't find another publishing house in the country to touch it Ernest said
BTS But let that go Wolf Larsen continued
BTS This was doubly resented even triply resented
BTS Hand-clapping and pleased cries from the gods greeted the performance
BTS He had lifted his eyes to me at the commencement of my outburst and followed me complacently until I had done and stood before him breathless and dismayed
BTS Mr
BTS Far off to the right a wide smoke haze dimmed the sky--the town of Pullman the soldier chauffeur told us or what had been the town of Pullman for it was utterly destroyed
BTS But the cove that intervened
BTS Your own hired purveyors of knowledge will tell you that you are wrong
BTS Life had been unfair to him
BTS So in the night when the men in the fort were asleep White Fang applied his teeth to the stick that held him
BTS It was frightful
BTS CHAPTER V THE LAW OF MEAT The cub's development was rapid
BTS The hunters left the table and went on deck and still we talked
BTS They spoke no more until camp was made
BTS He did not question it nor puzzle over it
BTS Had he merely stood over the meat head up and glowering White Fang would ultimately have slunk away
BTS That bear reached out his paws tonight to crush us
BTS Several such illustrations culled from the documents of the times are here appended
BTS He had not eaten in forty hours and he was weak with hunger
BTS Then we'll learn together sir
BTS Don't take no chances
BTS It seems unreal
BTS Billee the good-natured could lead for all they cared so long as he kept order
BTS As twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head watching his mates the cows he had known the calves he had fathered the bulls he had mastered as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading light
BTS Moral suasion was a thing unknown
BTS They had been for several weeks very turbulent and sullen and for that reason had been kept in camp
BTS Countless executions took place everywhere
BTS Fair weather was over and there was nothing left but to return to the galley
BTS Henry looked about with great carefulness and shook his head
BTS I am eating them now and you too
BTS How do you measure it
BTS And she had found him or what remained of him at the end of the trail
BTS I raised a shout and she ran down to see
BTS There is no Republican Party
BTS It was Spitz
BTS There is the militia
BTS One of the first ships that carried colonies to America after the discovery of the New World
BTS White Fang expected a beating
BTS Didn't you see the reporters scribbling like mad while he was speaking
BTS This body of soldiers had been evolved out of the old regular army and was now a million strong to say nothing of the colonial forces
BTS Before him was bounding the faint patch of white he had discovered
BTS Shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green
BTS There was a cry in my being like bugles calling me to her
BTS You have called me snake tiger shark monster and Caliban
BTS There are not enough soup-kitchens and bread-lines to go around you know and when men have nothing in their purses they usually die and die miserably unless they are able to fill their purses pretty speedily
BTS By the second night Maud was falling asleep from exhaustion
BTS A whitecap foamed above it and broke across in a snow-white smother
BTS I asked still holding his wrist
BTS What vessel is that
BTS A member who failed to complete his number committed suicide
BTS When it was over and Mugridge was back in the galley he became greasily radiant and went about his work humming coster songs in a nerve-racking and discordant falsetto
BTS And terrible they were for every foot of them was accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man
BTS I used to belong to the union
BTS Now it bound him with insentient fetters walling his soul in darkness and silence blocking it from the world which to him had been a riot of action
BTS Life became for me very happy in the refuge
BTS His body was theirs to maul to stamp upon to tolerate
BTS for a certain tie of attachment was forming between him and his surly lord
BTS All was ready and we were in the cave-room that served for kitchen and dining room when Ernest opened the door and entered
BTS Harrison heard the order and understood what was demanded of him but hesitated
BTS While the arch-oligarchs were no more than a handful there were myriads of lesser ones of the type say of Mr
BTS There you have it
BTS Suppose we refuse to turn the government over to you after you have captured it at the ballot-box
BTS I had never rowed in my life but I put out the oars and at the expense of much effort got the boat clear of the Ghost
BTS When I thought I had it I cried to her to slack away
BTS The comrades of the Fighting Groups were heroes all and the peculiar thing about it was that they were opposed to the taking of life
BTS Nor did I call this time from the top of the companion-way
BTS You are doomed to perish as all atavisms perish
BTS And when I pleaded guilty but defended the act as highly rational he but pressed me closer and laughed as only one of God's own lovers could laugh
BTS O'Toole or McCarthy would suit your mug a damn sight better
BTS I never heard a voice I hated so
BTS And at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them
BTS CHAPTER V THE COVENANT When December was well along Grey Beaver went on a journey up the Mackenzie
BTS How can you know anything about the working class
BTS It was not born of any knowledge of his yet it was the visible expression of the fear that was in him and for which in his own life there was no accounting
BTS No less an authority of the times than Carroll D
BTS He never let go his rifle even passing down the tackles with one hand
BTS And who in hell is Weedon Scott
BTS I must see him as soon as I am dressed
BTS But to return
BTS which is grey dark and light and greenish-grey and sometimes of the clear azure of the deep sea
BTS Nothing was happening to them
BTS She found him guilty before the act and treated him accordingly
BTS I saw her lips trembling and the tears swimming up in her eyes
BTS Sometimes she whirled with him
BTS and the question that had grown from the first in his eyes grew only the more imperative
BTS Wolf Larsen was apprehensive
BTS and with a deal of exertion got it on deck and into the boat
BTS I rose swiftly to my feet and I know quite unconsciously assumed a defiant attitude
BTS Labor's deposits in the savings banks are only a sort of reserve fund that is consumed as fast as it accumulates
BTS And so it is in this anxious time of waiting that I shall write of my husband
BTS And beyond that fire in the circling darkness Buck could see many gleaming coals two by two always two by two which he knew to be the eyes of great beasts of prey
BTS but Smoke closed his mouth again without having said anything
BTS A new and incomprehensibly fairer life was dawning
BTS Wolf Larsen rove a bowline in a piece of rope and slipped it under his shoulders
BTS They jes' know we ain't loaded to kill Henry remarked at bed-time indicating the gleaming circle that hemmed them in
BTS We will not reply to the bear in words
BTS There had been warning but White Fang was unversed in such things and did not understand the packing of a grip
BTS And you too seem a part of it
BTS And with the opening of my eyes and the looking came intolerable torment
BTS He thought he had me inside
BTS It was only a foot and a half long and in my superb ignorance I never dreamed that the club used ashore when raiding the rookeries measured four to five feet
BTS And White Fang won out on the one chance in ten thousand denied him by the surgeon
BTS More and more soldiers were arriving and in the jam we were unable to get away
BTS My present opinion is that hell is a pocket edition of Chicago
BTS Again the whole table agreed with Ernest
BTS And you are Maud Brewster I said solemnly gazing across at her
BTS There are the seals she suggested
BTS Blind and helpless I answered promptly waving him aside as a straw
BTS So were his brothers and sisters
BTS And look at that good wood
BTS It  But at this juncture Mugridge who had lifted his head and ascertained the extent of his loss floundered over on the deck and buried his teeth in Wolf Larsen's leg
BTS It is a miracle that you have survived
BTS At the sound Kiche leaped snarling to the end of her stick and there raged terribly because she could not come to his aid
BTS He's trying to speak I do believe Beth announced
BTS The Ghost was deserted
BTS I crept softly up the companion-way and peeped at him
BTS In those days thievery was incredibly prevalent
BTS And there was a wind blowing upon me which I could not resist swaying the very body of me till I leaned toward her all unconscious that I leaned
BTS Beauty Smith started to walk away
BTS He had found game but he had not caught it
BTS Baseek was old and already he had come to know the increasing valour of the dogs it had been his wont to bully
BTS Rather did they tolerate him in a broad human way as one tolerates any creature evilly treated in the making
BTS The arm and hand relaxed
BTS We were like good comrades and we grew better comrades as the days went by
BTS The Cockney popped out of the galley
BTS Had the windlass been in order it would not have been so difficult
BTS The men were foredoomed
BTS When they want to do a thing in business of course they must wait till there arises in their brains somehow a religious or ethical or scientific or philosophic concept that the thing is right
BTS She had not moved
BTS Of course at first much was mere blundering experiment
BTS That is all
BTS It seems as though you're standing on your own legs at last Hump we heard him say
BTS but so infinitesimal were the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous
BTS Then White Fang to show his friendship will have to be chief mourner at the funeral laughed the master
BTS The narrow scientist with his nose in a test-tube cannot understand philosophy
BTS They've ate the leather offen both ends
BTS But he held out till camp was reached when his driver made a place for him by the fire
BTS but wait until the favored unions develop caste
BTS Then Grey Beaver took a knife from a sheath that hung around his neck and went into the thicket and cut a stick
BTS He dozed despite himself crouching by the fire the blankets about his shoulders the axe between his knees and on either side a dog pressing close against him
BTS Her lips moved and though they formed no words she commanded me with her eyes plainly as speech to go to the help of the unfortunate man
BTS Even you laugh at the idea
BTS Then the circle would lie down again and here and there a wolf would resume its broken nap
BTS and he could hear the cries of the man-animals the sound of clubs striking upon bodies and the yelps of pain from the dogs so struck
BTS This is a mistake
BTS He gave one yelp of consternation and then her punishing jaws closed upon him
BTS The other portion killed and ate his own kind or was killed and eaten by his own kind
BTS There was a grunt from Weedon Scott's bunk and a stir of blankets
BTS I came to in the midst of wild movement
BTS The young fellow seemed to have recovered his composure for he answered steadily enough I don't know sir
BTS They had died so easily
BTS From the Yukon arose the hoarse bellowing of a river steamboat
BTS For that matter I cannot think of my husband without thinking of it
BTS Don't go please don't go
BTS I was looking up from the galley door and I could see him trembling as if with ague in every limb
BTS Her lips were blue with cold and she was hollow-eyed but oh how bravely her brown eyes looked at me
BTS His face was quite expectant when I began my answer but you should have seen it when I finished
BTS Mush on there
BTS He had come to know quite thoroughly the world in which he lived
BTS I had not thought there was any particular strain I answered
BTS All the men must have seen my condition but not one spoke or took notice of me till I was almost grateful to Wolf Larsen later on I was washing the dishes when he said Don't let a little thing like that bother you
BTS Francois called him and sought him in vain
BTS You who have destroyed the government of the people and who shamelessly flaunt your scarlet shame in public places call me anarchist
BTS The cut of her teeth in his neck still hurt but his feelings were hurt more grievously and he sat down and weakly whimpered
BTS One hundred dollars has been added to the value of the leather
BTS You poor devil he said gently rubbing White Fang's ears and tapping his spine
BTS Hi-yu Major
BTS And such a waist
BTS He sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great stiffness
BTS Only a short time ago I had my books gone through for the past ten years
BTS With the foremast in the work now went on apace
BTS I became a member of a section--that was in the day of the S
BTS And so we shall
BTS White Fang could see nothing dangerous in that
BTS They're after us Bill said the man at the front
BTS It's my miserable body not I
BTS Colonel Ingram and Judge Caldwell are pretty friendly
BTS The captain broke loose upon the dead man like a thunderclap
BTS His reason was unseated by the blind yearning of the flesh to exist and move at all hazards to move to continue to move for movement was the expression of its existence
BTS It was a moment of anxiety for the Ghost was rushing directly upon the beach a stone's throw distant
BTS But on the day we finished bending the schooner's sails he heard his last and the last movement of his lips died away but not before I had asked him Are you all there
BTS And they were unconscious that they had made this sound
BTS nor did he wonder where or why the call sounding imperiously deep in the forest
BTS The revolutionists everywhere are calling her the Red Virgin
BTS But first let me tell of my marriage
BTS Just turned sixteen sir A lie
BTS We have no food no water no blankets nothing
BTS Corporations have been enthroned an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed
BTS You must be very tired
BTS Maud made the discovery in the afternoon while trying to give him nourishment
BTS Oars were shipped and its occupants waited for us to heave to and take them aboard
BTS For no other reason has Anna Roylston refused blessed motherhood
BTS Who then controls the government
BTS I did not see into the eyes of Leach for he was looking at Wolf Larsen the old and implacable snarl of hatred strong as ever on his face
BTS He was justifying his existence than which life can do no greater
BTS Weedon Scott was in truth this thumb
BTS Life and death and the Cause were in the issue
BTS I rose to a climax of enthusiasm and worship and before he could guess my intention threw my arms around his neck and kissed him on the lips
BTS Unlike any other wall with which he had had experience this wall seemed to recede from him as he approached
BTS Then came trouble and violence
BTS Nineteen years have elapsed and despite our untiring efforts we have failed to find the man who really did throw the bomb
BTS But Bill ignored him
BTS Nothing worked
BTS Then where could they possibly be
BTS The voice of my companion brought me back to myself with a laugh
BTS They did nothing
BTS He took his head in his two hands and rested cheek on cheek
BTS Though he was my husband I was not permitted to get to him
BTS But you ought to know quite closely
BTS Ah I thought so
BTS On the night of the 22d of April they arose and murdered their officers only a small remnant of the latter escaping
BTS One instance in particular I remember
BTS You might wrap up the goods before you deliver 'm the stranger said gruffly and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around Buck's neck under the collar
BTS I burst into tears of mortification and hurt vanity
BTS There is no such law
BTS The bull-dog had managed to roll him over on his back and still hanging on to his throat was on top of him
BTS An hour went by and a second hour
BTS Major staggered to his feet but the blood spouting from his throat reddened the snow in a widening path
BTS In the middle of it White Fang rushing in sank his teeth into Lip-lip's hind leg
BTS Mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded comprehensively it was all so very simple
BTS When White Fang was nearly five years old Grey Beaver took him on another great journey and long remembered was the havoc he worked amongst the dogs of the many villages along the Mackenzie across the Rockies and down the Porcupine to the Yukon
BTS but he whispered in his ear
BTS His face in relation to the rest of him was prodigious
BTS You must cease to be
BTS He thought you were going to injure me and he wouldn't stand for it
BTS Wolf Larsen asked a peculiar softness in his voice as though he were overwhelmingly curious to hear the unspoken word
BTS The old dog did not like it and showed plainly that he was afraid of Buck
BTS Something must be done Humphrey Maud said next morning when I had told her of the night's occurrence
BTS It maintains luxurious lobbies at every state capital and at the national capital
BTS And there's not a soul in this world except myself that cares whether they starve or not
BTS yet he knew that here was horror and fled away from it in a panic
BTS Calvin confessed
BTS One was struck at once by his straightforwardness and manliness which in turn were tempered by a modesty which might be mistaken for timidity
BTS What took them possibly two minutes took me twenty but in the end I succeeded in setting and trimming it and with the steering-oar in my hands hauled on the wind
BTS W'y 'as all this come on me
BTS Wolf Larsen asked
BTS After his outbreak at the I
BTS Beaten decisively on its own chosen field it had abandoned that field and come over to the political field of the socialists
BTS Half a mile up the right fork his quick ears caught the sound of gnawing teeth
BTS A lowering of selling price to cost and even to less than cost
BTS Delicate as was the situation not alone in this but in other ways I flattered myself that I was able to deal delicately with it
BTS It   Here she paused and looked about the table at the circle of unsympathetic faces staring hard at the plates
BTS But at two in the morning his anxiety drove him out to the cold front stoop where he crouched and waited
BTS In fact the grey cub was not given to thinking at least to the kind of thinking customary of men
BTS You should have seen him when he came on board
BTS The hair began to rise on his neck and across the shoulders
BTS The butt rested against the outside of the port rail while the top of the mast overhung the water far beyond the starboard rail
BTS She lifted her lip at him in the old snarl of menace and his memory became clear
BTS Pertonwaithe the two men who held most of the stock in the Sierra Mills
BTS Yes Mr
BTS Buck's marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead
BTS But that danger-point was never reached
BTS Turn 'm loose for a spell
BTS But his eyes did light upon me and looked squarely into mine
BTS Still further other groups of comrades at the signal were to seize the officers of the Mercenaries and the police as well as all Oligarchs of unusual ability or who held executive positions
BTS Water was a consideration and I robbed every boat aboard of its breaker
BTS And what we learn of this will serve us with everything else we have to hoist aboard
BTS and with your atavistic ideas they will have nothing to do because they are what I said they are henchmen retainers of the Plutocracy
BTS One Eye with pointed interested ears laughed at her and beyond outlined against the white light she could see the brush of his tail waving good-naturedly
BTS For the Preacher loved life and did not want to die saying For a living dog is better than a dead lion
BTS The sight of him was sufficient to start them rushing after him at which times his swiftness usually carried him into safety
BTS I thought I saw for an instant the boat's bottom show black in a breaking crest
BTS What
BTS He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge's sons
BTS There was no place to which to flee
BTS Their hair already betrayed the reddish hue inherited from their mother the she-wolf
BTS At sight of the crowd they stopped their dogs and came over and joined it curious to see the cause of the excitement
BTS You must do as I say I interrupted authoritatively for I saw Wolf Larsen's gaze wandering toward us from where he paced up and down with Latimer amidships
BTS The Church shall not be dumb
BTS But the progress shoreward was slow
BTS and then began the cold grey of afternoon that would merge three hours later into night
BTS Hurled into hell he was unbeaten
BTS With the simpler creatures good and bad are things simply understood
BTS He merely surmises that there is some strain of dog in White Fang
BTS And now breakfast
BTS Seven days from the time they pulled into Dawson they dropped down the steep bank by the Barracks to the Yukon Trail and pulled for Dyea and Salt Water
BTS What is true of the United States is true of every other capitalist country with developed resources
BTS Come in and be fat was their proposition or stay out and starve
BTS You have already forgotten what we had agreed upon Ernest replied
BTS Oofty-Oofty had been the only one whose lines were at all pleasing while in so far as they pleased that far had they been what I should call feminine
BTS But I answered you say 'class struggle
BTS But you are not to be blamed for this
BTS And it is an irreconcilable conflict
BTS You're right he acknowledged at once
BTS As I was saying he went on as though nothing unwonted had happened the shark was not in the reckoning
BTS We of the East have seen to very little of you too little indeed of the Dean of American Letters the Second
BTS The boat-puller obeyed taking a turn around the little forward thwart and paying the line as it jerked taut
BTS We could hear the rising roar of it
BTS His hair was standing out all over him in tufts where her teeth had mauled
BTS She laughed and shook her head and held her hands up for inspection
BTS By the middle of the second day he had been running continuously for thirty hours and the iron of his flesh was giving out
BTS Rioting and mob-rule reigned throughout the rural districts
BTS You'll have to get a pry Matt counselled
BTS the sun ate from above
BTS During that time we were never apart
BTS It was there or not at all that the Macedonia could hope to catch us
BTS Shoulder to shoulder he struck her squarely
BTS Or at least it seems to me that such was society's attitude
BTS Nor did he give the wounded bull opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams they crossed
BTS And in order to do so let us apportion society into its class divisions
BTS You have not taken Bishop Berkeley into account
BTS Slowly the whole eastern sky filled with clouds that over-towered us like some black sierra of the infernal regions
BTS The she-wolf the young leader on her left and the one-eyed elder on her right led their half of the pack down to the Mackenzie River and across into the lake country to the east
BTS ' 'Section Nine that the militia when called into the actual service of the United States shall be subject to the same rules and articles of war as the regular troops of the United States
BTS Then there were comrades these were the women for the men would be busy elsewhere who were to post the proclamations from our secret presses
BTS Besides there was no false sentiment about her feeling
BTS But the elder leader was wise very wise in love even as in battle
BTS There had been no second bomb only a fear of one
BTS Then she looked at me and her face turned slowly toward the beach
BTS Them animals is damn hungry an' once they start in they'll sure get you Bill
BTS Every Granger state was ravaged with violence and washed in blood
BTS They were the first warning that I was on a lee shore
BTS and every act White Fang now performed was based upon the feeling that the white men were the superior gods
BTS She took my advice and was turning to put it into execution when her eyes lighted on Oofty-Oofty immediately before her his body instinct with alertness and grace as he held the turn of the rope
BTS You have talked of the instinct of immortality
BTS He looked as if he were going to break down but the next moment he had himself in control
BTS Ernest's prophecy was strikingly fulfilled in the cases of Mr
BTS White Fang followed and lay down beside her
BTS For my sake she begged
BTS There was no warmth no sign of fire
BTS He smiled inscrutably but did not answer
BTS A business man who was also a biologist and a sociologist would know approximately the right thing to do for humanity
BTS And so it went the inexorable elimination of the superfluous
BTS A big jackrabbit crossed our path leaping swiftly and silently like a deer
BTS he cried straightening up and turning around on the dog
BTS The Aurora's whistle hooted a final announcement of departure
BTS he demanded
BTS At last his nose touched the canvas
BTS Yet one habit remained to him from the old life
BTS Hartman was right
BTS A boat was being lowered
BTS It was this that made him protest at the commencement of our acquaintance against being called Yonson
BTS Neglecting the boats that remained to her she had altered her course so as to anticipate ours
BTS And to me they talked in fatherly ways patronizing my youth and inexperience
BTS How do you do Captain Larsen she answered
BTS I Humphrey Van Weyden was in love
BTS Come on
BTS You have closed your ears to the voices that are crying in the land--the voices of pain and sorrow that you will not hear but that some day will be heard
BTS The Bishop was struggling hard
BTS A sudden and deep sympathy welled up in me
BTS Ernest shrugged his shoulders whimsically and accepted a cup of tea
BTS Not so was it with the hunters
BTS And there out in the snow of their back track was the she-wolf waiting for him
BTS What gets me Henry is what a chap like this that's a lord or something in his own country and that's never had to bother about grub nor blankets
BTS It was at Circle City ere the year was out that Pete's apprehensions were realized
BTS Furling the sail and lashing it securely about the mast boom sprit and two pairs of spare oars I threw it overboard
BTS And by this ascertained standard White Fang treated them accordingly
BTS And yet I could not imagine him lying prone in death
BTS He Wickson a sordid money-grabber has the power to determine whether I shall or shall not teach in the university of the state
BTS The changes in expression they accomplished were wizard-like
BTS I do not follow you the Bishop said faintly
BTS They seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of John Thornton
BTS Each day he made it a point to caress and pet White Fang and to do it at length
BTS Prisoners and captors hiccoughed on one another's shoulders and swore mighty oaths of respect and esteem
BTS White Fang had done his work
BTS but both sides together were bewildering
BTS I did not dream of what was to occur until it did occur but he knew from the very first what was coming and awaited it bravely
BTS They have enabled us to sell more abroad which means that we'll be compelled to consume less at home
BTS Correct Scott answered passing the money over to him
BTS He is too ethical
BTS I've whispered never a word
BTS so you and all the rest of labor will participate in the equitable distribution of the products of the wonderful machines
BTS But the wind
BTS One hand extended outward and began to descend upon his head
BTS The yelping died away
BTS Not that he went out of his way looking for trouble
BTS That was why I became a physicist
BTS I made to step by him and he stood aside
BTS With the exception of Lip-lip they were compelled to hunch together for mutual protection against the terrible enemy they had made
BTS He tried to rise to his feet and after several attempts fell down from weakness
BTS The Ghost clung on close to the wind and betrayed no inclination to fall off broadside to the trough
BTS Others in the water were clamouring to be taken aboard again
BTS As it was spray and spume came aboard in such quantities that I bailed without cessation
BTS The audience was agitated but unresponsive
BTS I was so terror-stricken by this fight in the dark that I leaned against the ladder trembling and unable to ascend
BTS The stream was a small one but in the pool it widened out to a score of feet
BTS Do not forget he said that we had tacitly agreed that liberty in your case gentlemen means liberty to squeeze profits out of others
BTS the quality that has enabled the wolf and the wild dog to come in from the open and be the companions of man
BTS He had grown stronger and wiser and more confident
BTS But not quite
BTS He was a coward afraid to strike me because I had not quailed sufficiently in advance
BTS Once again I undid all my work by lowering the mast into the water
BTS This helped the cub's courage and though the woodpecker he next encountered gave him a start he proceeded confidently on his way
BTS And you know also how I crept about and avoided him I contended gaily
BTS Yes pig-ethics Ernest went on remorselessly
BTS In fashion distantly resembling the way men look upon the gods they create so looked White Fang upon the man-animals before him
BTS Call it that or anything you want to call it
BTS He sprang upon White Fang and began savagely to kick him
BTS Let us profit by their efficiency and cheapness
BTS A clean space of deck showed where it had stood
BTS You mean
BTS An hereditary servility no doubt was responsible
BTS How do you do Miss Brewster he said suddenly after a pause
BTS It had played him a scurvy trick when it fashioned him into the thing he was and it had played him scurvy tricks ever since
BTS Delightfully vague I murmured
BTS Fresh from his revolutionists he was shocked by the intellectual stupidity of the master class
BTS They were to be loosed on the palaces and cities of the masters
BTS The difference between them was that the guard carried a bunch of keys and a revolver
BTS The awe of man rushed over him again
BTS The hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on the ground swinging by the arms from limb to limb sometimes a dozen feet apart letting go and catching never falling never missing his grip
BTS And as fast as capitalistic governments crashed cooperative commonwealths arose in their place
BTS The lee rail where the dead man lay was buried in the sea and as the schooner lifted and righted the water swept across the deck wetting us above our shoe-tops
BTS He never got over it and it was delicious
BTS Van Weyden
BTS But Cherokee did not seem anxious to fight
BTS Cooky cannot hurt you
BTS It was patent to us what had happened
BTS For several minutes he was to all intents insane
BTS Then jump for the topsails and spread them quick as God'll let you the quicker you do it the easier you'll find it
BTS One reason for this is that Wolf Larsen seems to have taken a fancy to him
BTS Jibing the fore- and main-sails and setting the topsails again we headed back into the bank
BTS That'll do easy as she goes Wolf Larsen counselled back
BTS CHAPTER IV THE TRAIL OF THE GODS In the fall of the year when the days were shortening and the bite of the frost was coming into the air White Fang got his chance for liberty
BTS Van Weyden was the Cockney's fervent ejaculation
BTS The pair paused and surveyed the locked dogs
BTS All night he ran blundering in the darkness into mishaps and obstacles that delayed but did not daunt
BTS You have received the command from your masters to vote against it
BTS Hartman ran to the gutter and stooped over the object
BTS Maud looked at me inquiringly as I emerged
BTS which runs through many shades and colourings like intershot silk in sunshine
BTS It was quite similar to the one I had witnessed in the cabin
BTS It just comes to me she said that Captain Larsen was telling me how the men raided the rookeries
BTS Then he traced the development of machinery and social organization so that to-day the producing power of civilized man was a thousand times greater than that of the savage
BTS One Eye scooped out mouthfuls of the blood-soaked snow and chewed and tasted and swallowed
BTS Priest-like he wore a robe more white than foam And king-like swathed himself in royal red Three crowns of gold rose high upon his head
BTS The resulting wreck tied the line up for days
BTS To destroy the trusts is the only way we can see to escape their domination
BTS As it was he never had a chance to kill them
BTS A shaft of sunlight smote the over-curl and I caught a glimpse of translucent rushing green backed by a milky smother of foam
BTS The boat itself was crushed and splintered against the schooner's side as it came inboard
BTS He ought not to be selfish but he will continue to be selfish as long as he lives in a social system that is based on pig-ethics
BTS This is the first work the boss has given me in a week
BTS I overheard Henderson and another of the hunters Standish a Californian talking about it
BTS I knew then that it was no more than a flesh wound I had felt the steel grate on his shoulder-blade and I raised the knife to strike at a more vital part
BTS Hints that were untrue of course were given of insubordination all over the land crudely disguised with complacent references to punitive measures to be taken
BTS Locked in the yard and there deserted by the master White Fang lay down and went to sleep
BTS Does the middle class with its eight million occupied members
BTS also he did not attempt to steal from the newcomers
BTS I gave the actual facts of the case the long years Jackson had worked in the mills his effort to save the machinery from damage and the consequent accident and his own present wretched and starving condition
BTS He saw the camp again the tepees and the blaze of the fires
BTS The rasping scorching sands were a man's hard hands chafing my naked chest
BTS Less difficult it was to guess whom he hated than whom he did not hate
BTS Caste lines formed automatically
BTS They had but to appear on deck at the same time when they would be at it cursing snarling striking
BTS For six years the rebuilding of San Francisco had been going on and his business had quadrupled and octupled and yet he was no better off
BTS He seemed torn by some mighty grief
BTS And another such sea meant the end
BTS How is it that we have never heard of this law
BTS 'Cos you've 'urt yer pore little leg pore little mamma's darlin'
BTS The first time occurred when the master was trying to teach a spirited thoroughbred the method of opening and closing gates without the rider's dismounting
BTS She was too subtle not to follow the trend of my silence
BTS Bankruptcy--a peculiar institution that enabled an individual who had failed in competitive industry to forego paying his debts
BTS And now while we are on the trusts Ernest went on let us settle a few things
BTS Even the wheel quite a deal higher than the waist was covered and swept again and again
BTS Yesterday they evicted her
BTS Bill shook his head
BTS Manuel had one besetting sin
BTS I love animals
BTS When he appeared amongst them there was always a squabble
BTS and such a panic I now suffered
BTS The world was filled with surprise
BTS And yet it was not physically painful
BTS So far so good but there had been no hint of insanity nor even of nervous collapse
BTS He stepped out of the companion-way and came up to me
BTS Bring a light
BTS This is sold abroad
BTS From Brazil the United States in return for her surplus gets bonds and securities
BTS I glanced up
BTS She pressed my hand earnestly and let me go
BTS I am still a bit of the ferment you see he wrote a little later
BTS There is no accounting for it
BTS There is the danger that he has sold us out or is going to sell us out
BTS His father was what you call an agitator and his father was in jail for lese majesty--what you call speaking the truth about the Emperor
BTS Just as all was ready and the coffee poured the door opened and she came forth
BTS The manhood and the deep-hidden tender nature of their Bishop burst out and his Christian audience that loved him concluded that he was crazy
BTS I nodded my head
BTS I saw him looking anxiously about him and noted that Kelly who had come forward at the last moment was missing
BTS Thornton was running behind encouraging Buck with short cheery words
BTS Here Collie
BTS But it would be cowardly was the protest
BTS She defied all efforts of the master to make her become friends with White Fang
BTS I had much for which to thank Wolf Larsen was my thought as we went along the path between the jostling harems
BTS You would not think so to look at him but he was quite unable to stand alone at first
BTS He was in the same position in which I had left him and his head was rocking almost writhing from side to side
BTS It has been truly said that a little learning is a dangerous thing and you have exemplified it to-night with your madcap theories
BTS We left the table to go on deck for a steamer was a welcome break in the monotony of the sea on which we floated while the conviction that it was Death Larsen and the Macedonia added to the excitement
BTS and as the days went by and he did not reappear there was much gossip to the effect that he had committed suicide while temporarily deranged
BTS Of course it's all right because it comes out all right don't you see
BTS The other suspicion was allayed
BTS That is the capitalists had striven to placate the workers by interesting them financially in their work
BTS At first speech in French is self-conscious a matter of the will
BTS These were trapped by the Indians for the purpose and a fight between White Fang and a wolf was always sure to draw a crowd
BTS He had outgrown his mother
BTS I ain't a-sellin' he said
BTS but I knew she was wrong and I wondered if she likewise knew
BTS that the international organization of the socialists finally formulated their long-maturing policy on war
BTS That nothing moved nor sounded seemed ominous
BTS He came back dragging a heavy sea-chest which he deposited on top of the trap
BTS Now hell's a poppin' for somebody
BTS And he is all the happier for leaving life alone
BTS and in 1910 1688211
BTS The flying men were sheepishly coming back but all the while their eyes were raised apprehensively to the many-windowed lofty buildings that towered like the sheer walls of a canyon on each side of the street
BTS It was a starlight night and I could see the bulk of him dimly as he moved about
BTS But White Fang did not mind
BTS A thoughtless whim seized Thornton and he drew the attention of Hans and Pete to the experiment he had in mind
BTS And there it is
BTS You hardly realize sir that I am not a man or that I am unaccustomed to the vagrant careless life which you and your men seem to lead
BTS I took it from Larsen's private stores
BTS I was alone
BTS He was in a panic of terror
BTS But it was Dave who suffered most of all
BTS They were losing all touch and sympathy with the rest of the people and in fact were developing their own class morality and consciousness
BTS But the man whose hand he had bitten was angry
BTS Therefore was the father of Kiche a wolf
BTS Looks nasty he commented
BTS In the meantime we talked and talked much to the disgust of the hunters who could not understand a word
BTS We do not know what they are but they are there
BTS There were eight of them the two watches below and the air was thick with the warmth and odour of their breathing and the ear was filled with the noise of their snoring and of their sighs and half-groans tokens plain of the rest of the animal-man
BTS After that as I saw that he had not maligned my class and that the harsh and bitter things he said about it were justified I had drawn closer to him again
BTS The executions were afterward apportioned by lot
BTS 'Ere you come a pore mis'rable specimen of 'uman scum an' I tykes yer into my galley an' treats yer 'ansom an' this is wot I get for it
BTS The maids guided by trusty comrades were led away
BTS Labor does not consume its two billions even Mr
BTS It employs forty thousand lawyers to defeat the people in the courts
BTS On their backs in bags that fastened tightly around underneath the dogs carried from twenty to thirty pounds of weight
BTS It was her first time on deck since she had come aboard
BTS The other end of the stick in turn was made fast to a stake in the ground by means of a leather thong
BTS Strange to relate not one received the death sentence
BTS also she turned a deaf ear to my entreaties when I begged her to desist
BTS No shipping masters or beach-combers over here and he wants yer in his business and he wants yer bad
BTS In fact he seemed as much at home among the trees as on the ground
BTS You would make the sun go backward in the sky
BTS He stood on his dignity and when they attempted it his warning snarl and bristling mane were anything but playful
BTS for at that moment a man passing along the sidewalk stopped and glanced in at us
BTS His two dogs stayed close by him one on either side leaning against him for protection crying and whimpering and at times snarling desperately when a wolf approached a little closer than usual
BTS second to surprise it and knock it off its feet
BTS I can readily understand she began that this morning's affair was largely an accident
BTS and in the moment of asking I was aware of a solicitude that was something more than slight
BTS Even a man-animal a god White Fang ignored such was the terror he was in of losing his mother
BTS The barranca is the site of the ancient right of way that in the time of private property in land ran across the holding of one Chauvet a French pioneer of California who came from his native country in the fabled days of gold
BTS and from him he was now to learn much of the change and development that had taken place in himself
BTS The steerage where were two wounded hunters was a repetition of the forecastle except that Wolf Larsen was not being cursed
BTS But Ernest was merciless
BTS The gods held the power of life and death over their subjects and the gods were jealous of their power
BTS But Colonel Ingram did not curse
BTS Have you a catacomb here
BTS Here horses were ready and another comrade and without delay we were away through the starlight
BTS But not one of them made love to me as Ernest did
BTS you feel their mailed hands descending upon your profits and taking a pinch here and a pinch there--the railroad trust the oil trust the steel trust the coal trust
BTS But it seems you have breath to use and I'll give you a chance to use it
BTS Some pitched the flies others cut firewood and pine boughs for the beds and still others carried water or ice for the cooks
BTS He had been born in the working class though he was a descendant of the old line of Everhards that for over two hundred years had lived in America
BTS Scott Matt objected
BTS I wish you wouldn't she said
BTS They bristled up to him stiff-legged and challenging while he wasting no time on elaborate preliminaries snapping into action like a steel spring was at their throats and destroying them before they knew what was happening and while they were yet in the throes of surprise
BTS Besides organized labor had been so badly beaten that it did not care
BTS He was succeeded by his son Lewis Pocock and for five generations this remarkable line of slave-drivers handled the coal mines
BTS I would call her and start
BTS With his rifle in the broad daylight it might be possible for him to awe the wolves and save the dog
BTS A miners' meeting called on the spot decided that the dog had sufficient provocation and Buck was discharged
BTS It's not me duty but me bread an' butter an' the life of me children to stand by the mills
BTS Let me briefly go over the ground with you again Ernest said
BTS They sledded seventy miles up the Yukon swung to the left into the Stewart River passed the Mayo and the McQuestion and held on until the Stewart itself became a streamlet threading the upstanding peaks which marked the backbone of the continent
BTS And then the wheel would reappear and Wolf Larsen's broad shoulders his hands gripping the spokes and holding the schooner to the course of his will himself an earth-god dominating the storm flinging its descending waters from him and riding it to his own ends
BTS She was appalled by what she had done in bringing this firebrand before her blessed Philomath Club
BTS You tempted Cooky and he fell
BTS There were the marks he had left when descending the crumbling wall of the hole
BTS I who had lived my life in quiet places only to enter at the age of thirty-five upon a course of the most irrational adventure I could have imagined never had more incident and excitement crammed into any forty hours of my experience
BTS This it repeated several times till it was a short hundred yards away
BTS Asmunsen
BTS The family was on the porch taking the cool of the afternoon when White Fang arrived
BTS He had been brow-beaten and confused by Colonel Ingram
BTS He nodded his head
BTS Six thousand of the militia mutinied
BTS Across roofs and through buildings they made their way till they found themselves looking down upon the close-packed soldiers
BTS He licked his chops and waited
BTS Several buckets of water sufficed to put out the burning mattress in the middle of the steerage floor
BTS Ordinarily grey and cold and harsh they were now warm and soft and golden and all a-dance with tiny lights that dimmed and faded or welled up till the full orbs were flooded with a glowing radiance
BTS Ergo to the asylum with him
BTS Good-by
BTS The strange god paused at the foot of the great staircase and listened and White Fang was as dead so without movement was he as he watched and waited
BTS It is useless I answered
BTS And there were further reaches of vague and indeterminate feelings that stirred in me
BTS That settles it he announced
BTS Wot's the good of mykin' a 'oly show of ourselves for them mugs
BTS Then came another stirring of Wolf Larsen's tremendous strength
BTS Mugridge had heard the Kanaka's warning cry and was screaming madly
BTS The Kanaka leaped backward to his bunk to return with a second leap flourishing a long knife
BTS It was an avalanche of fury that Johnson strove vainly to fend off
BTS Scott queried eagerly
BTS I--I--think some of his blood is dripping from our roof-beams
BTS Irresponsibility had weakened him
BTS All the hours of his short life he had depended upon her
BTS He worked along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining and in this angle he came to bay protected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the front
BTS The last few inches to the wall of the tepee were crawled with painful slowness and precaution
BTS And then I saw there was nothing to fear
BTS I was confronted by the concrete
BTS But it is a revelation on the other hand
BTS They are practically unskilled labor
BTS There was no place for her in his scheme of things as there was no place for him in hers
BTS For days his manifestations of desire to lay hands on him had been growing more insistent and during that time White Fang had been compelled to avoid the camp
BTS So snug and warm was it that he was loath to leave it when Francois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire
BTS The members were executed one at a time at intervals of three weeks and their bodies exposed in the labor-ghetto of San Francisco
BTS I asked Peter Donnelly one of the foremen who had testified at the trial
BTS Otherwise I am in splendid condition feel that I am in splendid condition
BTS I could have kissed them had I dared even then in my rage the touch of them was so sweet so very sweet
BTS I was amused a couple of evenings back by seeing Wolf Larsen reading the Bible a copy of which after the futile search for one at the beginning of the voyage had been found in the dead mate's sea-chest
BTS CHAPTER XII The last twenty-four hours have witnessed a carnival of brutality
BTS Maud was pale but composed my eyes had gone instantly to her face and she was looking at me with mingled alarm and relief
BTS This would not do for a draw-knife so he laid hold of the running part hove taut and made fast
BTS But he was thrown down and choked repeatedly till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass collar from off his neck
BTS I did and it is because I did that I have a quarrel with you I challenged
BTS Better have a club handy Matt warned
BTS The worst of the storm must have blown that night though little I noticed it
BTS Well we don't I concluded defiantly beginning again my knocking and hammering
BTS I remembered Michelet's To man woman is as the earth was to her legendary son
BTS I could see the vessel being swallowed up in the fog
BTS They arose around him on every side like some monstrous quick-growing form of life
BTS Then he peered over the rail with levelled rifle
BTS A derrick-boom rigged to the foremast had accomplished this
BTS Somebody strike a light my thumb's out of joint said one of the men Parsons a swarthy saturnine man boat-steerer in Standish's boat in which Harrison was puller
BTS Wolf Larsen nodded approval and relinquished the wheel to me
BTS Buck rushed at the splintering wood sinking his teeth into it surging and wrestling with it
BTS Will you have to begin all over
BTS Those who hurried up heard him cursing Buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly
BTS Then I bethought me of the great yachtsman's knife he always carried and I came to him and spoke to him first softly then loudly
BTS So the cub had no quarrel with his hostile environment
BTS At a particularly bad spot where a ledge of barely submerged rocks jutted out into the river Hans cast off the rope and while Thornton poled the boat out into the stream ran down the bank with the end in his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge
BTS The wind was strengthening steadily and the sea rising
BTS D'ye hear
BTS I talk of the instinct of life which is to live and which when death looms near and large masters the instinct so called of immortality
BTS Your socialistic dream is
BTS He shook his head his stern mouth shaping the strangest twisted smile
BTS that muscles were softly crawling and shaping about the hips along the back and across the shoulders
BTS it may be a very beautiful spirit that will go soaring up into the blue from that ugly carcass
BTS Opportunity favoured when White Fang remained quiet
BTS She smiled at me whimsically gloriously and I knew there was no need for forgiveness
BTS Well Matthewson said slowly and deliberately so that all could hear I've got a thousand dollars that says he can't
BTS The knuckles were skinned and inflamed clear across the fingers swollen the nails rimmed with black
BTS There is no telling what he may do
BTS It was my father's name for my mother
BTS Ernest is a very remarkable young man and I'd rather see you his wife than the wife of Rockefeller himself or the King of England
BTS The cook grinned at my exhibition of nerves and thrust into my hand a steaming mug with an 'Ere this'll do yer good
BTS I am giving these details so that the size of this little floating world which holds twenty-two men may be appreciated
BTS So when his blue moods come on nothing remains for him but to be devilish
BTS and his blood carried it to the farthest reaches of his body building it into the toughest and stoutest of tissues
BTS She draws out the dog an' then all the rest pitches in an' eats 'm up
BTS The hair hung down limp and draggled or matted with dried blood where Hal's club had bruised him
BTS Wickson and Mr
BTS I had stood on my father's legs
BTS Once more the clenched fists went upward and he groaned
BTS It can never be taken away from me because it can never be found
BTS If the desire to remain sober prevails it is because it is the strongest desire
BTS Now the Philomath Club was the most select on the Pacific Coast
BTS Nex' time you can go to 'ell say I an' I've a good mind to give you what-for anyw'y
BTS So near did the wolves approach that the dogs became frantic with terror and it was necessary to replenish the fire from time to time in order to keep the adventurous marauders at safer distance
BTS Not only does Thomas Mugridge continue to hate me but he has discovered a new reason for hating me
BTS This certitude was shown by the whole pack
BTS They sat dumbly acquiescent with the exception of Dr
BTS He occupied an anomalous position preaching an emasculated socialism combined with a nondescript sort of petty bourgeois capitalism
BTS You were light in my darkness but now I too see the light
BTS This was a serious masquerade on the part of Avis Everhard
BTS and it was her husband and family and toy
BTS while he would have welcomed with delight Lip-lip and the whole snarling cowardly pack
BTS And how my hatred for him grew and grew during that fearful time to cyclopean dimensions
BTS It was against the law and he had learned it
BTS A dozen times Perrault nosing the way broke through the ice bridges being saved by the long pole he carried which he so held that it fell each time across the hole made by his body
BTS Where was the grandeur of life that it should permit such wanton destruction of human souls
BTS One of the hunters a little dark-eyed man whom his mates called Smoke was telling stories liberally intersprinkled with oaths and obscenities
BTS 'The courtesies of ecclesiastical controversy
BTS If I should catch you by the throat thus his hand was about my throat and my breath was shut off and began to press the life out of you thus and thus your instinct of immortality will go glimmering and your instinct of life which is longing for life will flutter up and you will struggle to save yourself
BTS at Ernest
BTS He was bearded and gaunt and dirty but I succeeded in remembering him as the stalwart youth that had spent several months in our Glen Ellen refuge three years before
BTS In mid air just as his jaws were about to close on the man he received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip
BTS If they strike the first violent blow we will strike the last
BTS And the gods were kind
BTS The noblest metaphysician of them all Ernest laughed
BTS The three maids who accompanied me were revolutionists
BTS One leap more and his teeth would be sinking into it
BTS Instead of coming back he was carried away to a hospital with a bullet through his lungs and another through the fleshy part of his neck
BTS but there was more to it than this
BTS Me only friend is the company
BTS They did sir
BTS Besides this god had no club no whip no firearm
BTS Cornered in the right-angle of the poop and galley he sprang like a cat to the top of the cabin and ran aft
BTS Answers to the name of Buck' the man soliloquized quoting from the saloon-keeper's letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents
BTS Why my dear fellow you will live for ever
BTS His stout mittens temporarily protected his hands and he scooped live coals into the air in all directions until the campfire took on the semblance of a volcano
BTS He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat
BTS This lost mine was steeped in tragedy and shrouded in mystery
BTS Besides it is as I have said the law
BTS And if I and a few others should lead a million and a half of men into the houses of all the well-to-do there would be a great deal of shooting wouldn't there
BTS Our interests became mutual and we worked together and played together
BTS He fired rapidly six times and six of the pack lay dead or dying another manifestation of power that sank deep into White Fang's consciousness
BTS Ernest laughed quickly
BTS White Fang leaped clear and as the man struggled to rise was in again with the slashing fangs
BTS Had he fallen and dripped his brains upon the deck like honey from the comb there would have been no loss to the world
BTS My mind itself was shocked
BTS He was worried and apprehensive yet the camp lured his mate and she was loath to depart
BTS A creature of the Iron Heel he had successfully masqueraded as a revolutionist and penetrated deep into the secrets of our organization
BTS At five in the morning Maud brought me hot coffee and biscuits she had baked and at seven a substantial and piping hot breakfast put new lift into me
BTS It's childish I laughed later for him to do such things and for me to grow angry over them for that matter
BTS Nevertheless he ran with his head even with the shoulder of his one-eyed elder
BTS nor do I wish ever to see him in a genuine rage when all the force of him is called into play
BTS I offer you eight hundred for him sir before the test sir
BTS Then from above I heard a sound of scrambling
BTS I heard them when I drove in last night
BTS They were perambulating skeletons
BTS Van Weyden's neck
BTS I cannot say that my very first impression of him was favorable
BTS There was a slight flush under his bronze but otherwise he bore no signs of the battle
BTS Wot 're you good for any'wy
BTS They philosophized if you will pardon my misuse of the word about the heart as the seat of the emotions while the scientists were formulating the circulation of the blood
BTS Through daylight and dark I follow the bark I keep like a hound on her trail
BTS It was all very well for half a dozen wolves to drive a lynx spitting and bristling up a tree
BTS Ernest ignored the thrust
BTS The labor castes were honeycombed by our agents--men whose eyes saw beyond the belly-need the radiant figure of liberty and brotherhood
BTS I demanded
BTS He could not understand what it all meant
BTS The master's voice was sufficient
BTS A line connected it with the bow and as it floated low in the water practically unexposed to the wind it drifted less rapidly than the boat
BTS I'll go out the back
BTS Well I think doing a few things for yourself will hardly dislocate any joints
BTS Not on yer life was the angry retort
BTS You are beginning to dig truth for yourself
BTS The bepuzzlement in their faces was delicious
BTS But I called her this and other and dearer things in my thoughts only
BTS At sound of this the cry of Life plunging down from Life's apex in the grip of Death the fall pack at Buck's heels raised a hell's chorus of delight
BTS No member of the favored unions was safe
BTS He sensed the evil in him and feared the extended hand and the attempts at soft-spoken speech
BTS The bad stands for all things that are fraught with discomfort menace and hurt and is hated accordingly
BTS There it was the question flat
BTS The load quivered and from under the runners arose a crisp crackling
BTS CHAPTER XX The remainder of the day passed uneventfully
BTS He was put into a baggage-car by the master chained in a corner in the midst of heaped trunks and valises
BTS As they swung on the turn the sled went over spilling half its load through the loose lashings
BTS Of course the Iron Heel kept the figures secret but at a very conservative estimate at least one hundred and thirty thousand Mercenaries were slain
BTS Live things were meat
BTS He clung on growling savagely
BTS This was more of the terrible unknown
BTS It became quite a movement in fact
BTS The roll of the martyrs increased mightily
BTS This gentleness and violence on his part was a curious blend similar to the one in his carriage of awkwardness and ease
BTS It was long a question of debate whether the burning of the South Side ghetto was accidental or whether it was done by the Mercenaries
BTS And in prison while awaiting trial he suffocated himself under his blankets
BTS He gave them a bigger lay
BTS And not for nothing had he learned to walk softly when superior strength went by
BTS His actions were theirs to command
BTS Then and with black suddenness the boat would shoot clear through the foaming crest bow pointed to the sky and the whole length of her bottom showing wet and dark till she seemed on end
BTS The bull-dog stood too short while its massive jaws were an added protection
BTS This was not without its effect on White Fang
BTS Ernest demanded
BTS Scott asked
BTS It is no slight matter for two men particularly when a stiff wind has sprung up to handle a vessel like the Ghost steering keeping look-out for the boats and setting or taking in sail
BTS Your eyes are becoming set
BTS I'll be back were his parting words
BTS Then there came a time when the grey cub no longer saw his father appearing and disappearing in the wall nor lying down asleep in the entrance
BTS The Bishop shook his head
BTS The silence was painful
BTS But gods are accustomed to being obeyed and Grey Beaver wrathfully launched a canoe in pursuit
BTS But life and death were in that glance
BTS Wolf or dog it's all the same he's ben tamed 'ready
BTS was Johnson's cry
BTS Look at me
BTS He prowled about the cabin while the sled-dogs slept and the first night-visitor to the cabin fought him off with a club until Weedon Scott came to the rescue
BTS Sometimes they chanced upon other wolves usually in pairs
BTS As I have said there was never such a lover as he
BTS The top one I had drawn over her face to shelter it from the night so I could see nothing but the vague shape of her and her light-brown hair escaped from the covering and jewelled with moisture from the air
BTS His is the courage of fear a strange thing I know well of myself and at any moment it may master the fear and impel him to the taking of my life
BTS But the work was going on everywhere
BTS Yer should 'a been born a gentleman an' never 'ad to work for yer livin'
BTS But the machine killed her
BTS On every hand were tall wooded knolls a group of them with all the seeming of having been flung there from some careless Titan's hand
BTS The two animals threshed about the lynx ripping and tearing with her claws and using her teeth as well while the she-wolf used her teeth alone
BTS This was the mouth of the cave and the source of light
BTS The unknown had caught him at last
BTS I place the transparent scale on this star-map revolving the scale on the North Pole
BTS My mate's gone and there'll be a lot of promotion
BTS He gave no protection
BTS She laughed with amused appreciation
BTS A change a great change is coming in society
BTS He was daring destiny and he was unafraid
BTS They paused with instant alarm and looked at each other suspiciously
BTS And then suddenly he turned upon her
BTS Our minds were at ease
BTS I who had lived out of the whirl of the world had never dreamed that its work was carried on in such fashion
BTS When Buck and Curly grew excited half wild with fear he raised his head as though annoyed favored them with an incurious glance yawned and went to sleep again
BTS CHAPTER XIX TRANSFORMATION You must make yourself over again Ernest wrote to me
BTS With the exception of our little cove the other beaches sloped gently back for a distance of half-a-mile or so into what I might call rocky meadows with here and there patches of moss and tundra grass
BTS nor could she gain on him so great was his terror nor could he leave her so great was her madness
BTS Wolf Larsen and I between us cut off Kerfoot's crushed finger and sewed up the stump
BTS There were cries of men and churn of sleds the creaking of harnesses and the eager whimpering of straining dogs
BTS And on being solicited he explained
BTS And the idea of the solidarity of labor so evidenced appealed to the imagination of all
BTS I've never been sick in my life Hump he said as I guided him to his room
BTS but they were frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence
BTS Hans promptly snubbed with the rope as though Buck were a boat
BTS Now look here Mr
BTS nor would they by paying for accident tempt the poor to hurt themselves in the machinery
BTS He was yet to learn that for size and weight the weasel was the most ferocious vindictive and terrible of all the killers of the Wild
BTS And the Church ignored it
BTS He swam powerfully and was dragged ashore by Pete and Hans at the very point where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began
BTS There was no telling
BTS And all that is the woman who wrote A Kiss Endured
BTS His chin fell forward on his chest
BTS They too have muscles of one kind and another made to grip and tear and destroy
BTS We are not responsible for it
BTS In addition to some small change and I have a good memory for such things it had contained one hundred and eighty-five dollars in gold and paper
BTS Men were holding their breaths intensely unconscious of the fact
BTS And there will be no tea no soups nothing hot till we have made land somewhere somehow
BTS For days at a time we could never see the sun nor take an observation
BTS The moment before we had been leaping through the sunshine the clear sky above us the sea breaking and rolling wide to the horizon and a ship vomiting smoke and fire and iron missiles rushing madly upon us
BTS Eh
BTS I forgot to inquire he went on suavely as to the nature of your occupation
BTS Dave he was called and he ate and slept or yawned between times and took interest in nothing not even when the Narwhal crossed Queen Charlotte Sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed
BTS and the storms held no terror for us
BTS Life sums itself up to you in profits
BTS I want to get some sleep
BTS You'll learn in time how to take care of your money for yourself
BTS But when the frames of poles were made into tepees by being covered with cloth and skins White Fang was astounded
BTS I said 'selfish
BTS But I have discovered a place where I can get three for ten cents
BTS They are hanging on your lips for that answer because they have no answer themselves
BTS namely the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers
BTS and during that brief time I was proud of myself and I grew to love the heave and roll of the Ghost under my feet as she wallowed north and west through the tropic sea to the islet where we filled our water-casks
BTS But the god talked on interminably
BTS The horror of it drove me out on deck
BTS It was a bribe father protested
BTS And that was all
BTS Life itself was meat
BTS What if the trail of the gods led out on that side
BTS and when the whole arrangement was completed I could not but be startled by the power and latitude it gave me
BTS In the division of the joint-product capital wanted all it could get and labor wanted all it could get
BTS But the fight lasted so long that he had time to cry himself out and to experience a second burst of courage
BTS Give him hell for me
BTS She too rendered submission to the man-animals
BTS He at least after the customary agonizing of youth found content and made of his materialism a joyous thing
BTS The bull-dog missed by a hair's-breadth and cries of praise went up as White Fang doubled suddenly out of danger in the opposite direction
BTS He pulled on a pair of mittens put on his cap and ascended the companion-stairs while I followed his suggestion by going to bed
BTS I am almost sure of it
BTS was his next question
BTS Maud Brewster
BTS I've got my peepers on yer
BTS She was consigned to the Napa Asylum
BTS I was confident that we should find a station in some one of the coves for I knew that the rookeries of Bering Sea were thus guarded
BTS White Fang drove in upon it but his own shoulder was high above while he struck with such force that his momentum carried him on across over the other's body
BTS Latimer cried
BTS Sometimes he was under sometimes on top
BTS We had no other interest than Wolf Larsen and his presence weighed us down with an apprehension which prevented us from doing any of the little things we had planned
BTS It happened in an instant
BTS The other dog made no advances nor received any
BTS She acknowledged her identity with a nod
BTS Not sighted I answered
BTS When you get a dollar hang on to it
BTS I've learned that much at any rate
BTS Dave and Sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership
BTS It was patent to everybody that the boy was afraid
BTS And White Fang was growling responsively the crooning note of the growl more pronounced than ever
BTS There was an ominous and worried expression on their faces
BTS They even see their way to doing wrong that right may come of it
BTS He's my old man
BTS It was only by long practice that such results could be obtained
BTS It is sold abroad Mr
BTS We talked a little longer before she went
BTS And you hear that fellow with a frog in his throat a steam schooner as near as I can judge crawlin' in from the Heads against the tide
BTS O'Brien contended it was Thornton's privilege to knock the runners loose leaving Buck to break it out from a dead standstill
BTS But there were coastwise skippers I would have returned and killed when a man's strength came to me only the lines of my life were cast at the time in other places
BTS There was a puff of white smoke a burst of flame and the rough edge of the paper was alight
BTS Instead he pointed towards the wall of darkness that pressed about them from every side
BTS Father made no outcry
BTS Each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty miles
BTS He shook himself but more of it fell upon him
BTS A familiar pair of shoulders in a cotton shirt and a familiar fringe of white hair had caught his eye
BTS The fog was gone and in its place the sun sparkled crisply on the surface of the water I turned to the east where I knew California must lie but could see nothing save low-lying fog-banks the same fog doubtless that had brought about the disaster to the Martinez and placed me in my present situation
BTS Miss Brentwood thinks I am as mild as a kitten and as good-natured and stolid as the family cow
BTS After each repulse when the old wolf sheered abruptly away from the sharp-toothed object of his desire he shouldered against a young three-year-old that ran on his blind right side
BTS It was a challenge but Smoke refused to accept it
BTS During this period there were many ministers cast out of the church for preaching unacceptable doctrine
BTS He must do his work quickly and get away
BTS There was movement in the doorways
BTS A companion organization to the Valkyries was the Berserkers
BTS They were labor-slaves
BTS I could hear the explosions of their mines and bombs and see the smoke of their conflagrations and that was all
BTS And I will answer for you that you were afraid
BTS Henry grunted and crawled into bed
BTS He ignored my sarcasm saying Suppose I clap the hatch on now
BTS His naked fangs and writhing lips were uniformly efficacious rarely failing to send a bellowing on-rushing dog back on its haunches
BTS father cried
BTS Look sharp or you'll get doused was Mr
BTS He smoked his cigar and looked on quietly till the thing was accomplished and then paced aft by my side along the weather poop
BTS But you who make a mock of human life don't you place any value upon it whatever
BTS He stood upon his right to go his way unmolested and to give trail to no dog
BTS And out of all the rack and ruin rose the form of the nascent Oligarchy imperturbable indifferent and sure
BTS Then there were long deep-drawn sniffs
BTS But three days was all Wolf Larsen allowed him in which to recover from the effects of the beating
BTS for the general strike was a political strike
BTS In order to face the constant danger of hurt and even of destruction his predatory and protective faculties were unduly developed
BTS White Fang did not run away though he was allowed to remain loose because he liked this new god
BTS His development was in the direction of power
BTS The wind smote the schooner with a sudden gust and she heeled over till her lee rail was buried the roar in her rigging rising in pitch to a shriek
BTS This would always culminate with the master's arms going around White Fang's neck and shoulders while the latter crooned and growled his love-song
BTS This dog was thrashing about in a death-struggle directly on the trail and Buck passed around him without stopping
BTS If it wasn't for his kindness I'd starve
BTS They are not biologists nor sociologists
BTS To him it stood as the greatest of hurts
BTS There's one now I said pointing to a young bull in the water
BTS And bah
BTS I felt that under the guise of an intellectual swashbuckler was a delicate and sensitive spirit
BTS But there were many police and watchmen in evidence and now and again automobile patrols of the Mercenaries slipped swiftly past
BTS He never took his eyes from the god thrusting his head forward with ears flattened back and hair involuntarily rising and cresting on his neck
BTS The belly flashed white in swift upward rush
BTS Also this live thing was meat
BTS I never did a bit of work in my life except to appeal aesthetically to Pharisees--I thought I was preaching the message--and yet I was worth half a million dollars
BTS but Francois not noticing him brought Sol-leks to the coveted position
BTS I could hardly believe until the next incident occurred that it was the face of a man who could behave as he had behaved to the cabin-boy
BTS Deep in the forest a call was sounding and as often as he heard this call mysteriously thrilling and luring he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire and the beaten earth around it and to plunge into the forest and on and on he knew not where or why
BTS But a friendly little yelp reassured him and he went back to investigate
BTS I promise you that you will have the time of your life
BTS They talked in large ways of policy and they identified policy and right
BTS He also was addicted to crowding her to veering toward her till his scarred muzzle touched her body or shoulder or neck
BTS Have you made up your mind
BTS When she had slipped this on over her head I exchanged the boy's cap she wore for a man's cap large enough to cover her hair and when the flap was turned down to completely cover her neck and ears
BTS That would settle it
BTS The she-wolf's need to find the thing for which she searched had now become imperative
BTS On the way to town hanging around the saloon at the cross-roads were three dogs that made a practice of rushing out upon him when he went by
BTS I made certain that it contained the proper equipment of oars rowlocks and sail
BTS Please please understand me I said hurriedly lowering my voice
BTS It was not well
BTS her ferocity equalled his
BTS It was at this time that my father disappeared
BTS He took it as his master's will that Matt should drive him and work him just as he drove and worked his master's other dogs
BTS Jackson who had lost his arm in the Sierra Mills and who had been the cause of my own conversion into a revolutionist I never saw again
BTS We were creating a new art and we had much to discover
BTS From his St
BTS My shears were too short
BTS My skin was scorching in the torment of fire
BTS The forecastle was like an angry hive of bees aroused by some marauder
BTS Its members were fanatics madmen
BTS whoa
BTS That will be civil war Ernest warned them
BTS He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up
BTS The strength of your wealth at this moment is only an empty shell
BTS The Macedonia was now but a mile away the black smoke pouring from her funnel at a right angle so madly she raced pounding through the sea at a seventeen-knot gait 'Sky-hooting through the brine as Wolf Larsen quoted while gazing at her
BTS That dog of yourn won't let me lay a finger on your stuff
BTS But bit by bit whenever the chance offered he was getting more of the loose skin and fur in his mouth
BTS Avis Everhard would have had to live for many generations ere she could have seen the clearing up of this particular mystery
BTS He had one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky enough to discover
BTS I lifted the trap in the floor but for some moments gazed dubiously into the darkness of the lazarette beneath
BTS And on the last night of the second week they topped White Pass and dropped down the sea slope with the lights of Skaguay and of the shipping at their feet
BTS I had lived a placid uneventful sedentary existence all my days the life of a scholar and a recluse on an assured and comfortable income
BTS Many little privileges were taken away from it while its wages and its standard of living steadily sank down
BTS Down that flying jib Mr
BTS Do you know it sometimes makes me afraid
BTS I helped myself also to blankets mittens oilskins caps and such things from the slop-chest
BTS His views were perilous to society and society could not conceive that such perilous views could be the product of a sane mind
BTS The hunter golden bearded like a sea-king came over the rail and dropped on deck
BTS But be that as it may they joined with Lip-lip in the persecution
BTS And in these cities will the oligarchs dwell and worship beauty
BTS What are we to do then
BTS On the other hand try as they would they could not kill White Fang
BTS he had so loved the Ghost and delighted in her sailing powers
BTS And his facts made for them a Waterloo
BTS So saying he put up his fists and started for me
BTS At four o'clock he executed a running jump gained the roof of the chicken-house and leaped to the ground outside whence he sauntered gravely to the house
BTS Growth is life and life is for ever destined to make for light
BTS Their work was to blow up the magazines and to destroy the delicate mechanism of all the war machinery
BTS His lips moved and he gave voice to this enigmatic utterance A shilling's worth a quarter
BTS Bitter experiences these which perforce he swallowed calling upon all his wisdom to cope with them
BTS But I couldn't believe it
BTS Its flight was lame
BTS Thus and unavoidably at the very beginning out of this segregation arose caste
BTS With Leach it was different
BTS That's what you call a paradox isn't it
BTS Club and whip were both used upon him and he experienced the worst beating he had ever received in his life
BTS It was no reasoned impulse that made White Fang do what he then did
BTS He had only intermittent use of it
BTS It is a very little world a mote a speck and I marvel that men should dare to venture the sea on a contrivance so small and fragile
BTS Why not
BTS The banks themselves constituting one of the most important forces of the Oligarchy continued to call in credits
BTS Hartman was hopeless over the situation
BTS Unpossessed of conscience or moral instinct you might have mastered the world broken it to your hand
BTS Why not creep aboard the Ghost well I knew the way to Wolf Larsen's bunk and kill him in his sleep
BTS this joy of living
BTS an' never once have I opened me lips but to say fine things iv them an' him God curse his soul an' may he rot in purgatory ten thousand years and then go down to the last an' deepest hell iv all
BTS I asked
BTS He glanced at the hand that held the brand noticing the cunning delicacy of the fingers that gripped it how they adjusted themselves to all the inequalities of the surface curling over and under and about the rough wood and one little finger too close to the burning portion of the brand sensitively and automatically writhing back from the hurtful heat to a cooler gripping-place
BTS Get your traps aft into the mate's berth
BTS He could not follow for before his nose leaped the merciless fanged terror that would not let him go
BTS These were so many suggestions
BTS Grey Beaver got the thirst
BTS And behind all ever menacing was death violent and terrible
BTS where are you
BTS It is true Mr
BTS yet he had to do something
BTS or I'll sail you all into Kingdom Come
BTS A snappy breeze was blowing from the west with the promise of more wind behind it
BTS And by doing nothing they tied their war-lord's hands
BTS The Church condones the frightful brutality and savagery with which the capitalist class treats the working class
BTS If you'll come with me in the boat we'll get to work and straighten things out
BTS We will say for the sake of round figures that the total production of wealth in the United States is one year is four billion dollars
BTS the saloon-keeper demanded
BTS But this is too far in advance of events
BTS Again the Ghost sprang away and raced before the wind and for two hours Johnson and Leach pursued us
BTS Morgan so potent though it may be added they need his brains more than he needs their votes-- at present and the combination of the two constitutes in large measure the 'community of interest
BTS He must have suffered severely for he called me in and obeyed my commands like a sick child
BTS They still trouble me was his answer
BTS he asked apathetically
BTS CHAPTER II THE LAIR For two days the she-wolf and One Eye hung about the Indian camp
BTS Indeed she was a slender delicate woman as women go but to me she was so ethereally slender and delicate that I was quite prepared for her arm to crumble in my grasp
BTS In those early days the agents of the Iron Heel were clumsy in their methods
BTS I don't know was my answer
BTS Everhard Bishop Morehouse said
BTS The warders said it was impossible but nevertheless the cell was empty and half in half out of it lay the body of a dead guard
BTS The car had been to him no more than a room in a house and when he had entered it the city had been all around him
BTS Ernest paused looked at him searchingly and accepted the challenge
BTS So with a You beast
BTS Not only were we sure of being dry and warm and sheltered from the wind but we had the softest and most luxurious mattresses that could be made from moss
BTS Thus discontent was lulled and the proletariat robbed of its natural leaders
BTS And what did the company do for him
BTS Yes sir killed 'im dead-oh
BTS It is clumsy but it will serve the purpose and that is the main thing I went on yearning for her praise
BTS Father wrote to the publishers and was informed that the plates had been accidentally injured
BTS but I knew that it would work and I felt myself a man of power as I looked at it
BTS It is what comes when there is nothing wrong with one's digestion when his stomach is in trim and his appetite has an edge and all goes well
BTS Besides I was not skilled in the speech of eyes
BTS Right of way
BTS Those cursed hunters was his comment
BTS she asked in a strained tense voice
BTS I guess he's digested by this time an' cavortin' over the landscape in the bellies of twenty different wolves was Henry's epitaph on this the latest lost dog
BTS Druther break cayuses any day and twice on Sundays was the reply of the driver as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses
BTS This was the moment of danger
BTS Van Weyden will you kindly put about on the port tack
BTS Perrault was a French-Canadian and swarthy
BTS At such times love was joy to him a wild keen-thrilling satisfaction
BTS I asked
BTS And sure enough
BTS he was repeating over and over in a whisper
BTS I've 'ad the fever in Aspinwall in 'Avana in New Orleans
BTS He had earned it and he would not be content with less
BTS I know that my own kind could not have believed it possible
BTS His muscles were surcharged with vitality and snapped into play sharply like steel springs
BTS Calm and sure they were as her spirit itself
BTS We tied our horses among the redwoods at the pool
BTS It is not given us to know how some animals know laughter and know when they are being laughed at
BTS Quarter was neither given nor taken and in the fighting the revolutionists had the advantage of being above
BTS The mast was stepped
BTS I don't know she answered smiling at me
BTS The man addressed as Yonson a man of the heavy Scandinavian type ceased chafing me and arose awkwardly to his feet
BTS Maud was only faint and dizzy and I left her lying on the deck when I took my second plunge below
BTS Grey Beaver never petted nor caressed
BTS There was no sounding such a spirit no measuring no determining of metes and bounds nor neatly classifying in some pigeon-hole with others of similar type
BTS Therefore he had disobeyed the will of both the gods and earned the consequent punishment
BTS Garthwaite and I bore charmed lives
BTS The wolves were now in the country of game and though they still hunted in pack they hunted more cautiously cutting out heavy cows or crippled old bulls from the small moose-herds they ran across
BTS And to gain
BTS He could eat anything no matter how loathsome or indigestible
BTS And for two generations the Group flourished
BTS He was exhibited as the Fighting Wolf and men paid fifty cents in gold dust to see him
BTS We published it in our papers
BTS And if the Master's work leads there so be it
BTS Francois complied whereupon Buck trotted in laughing triumphantly and swung around into position at the head of the team
BTS Pressing the pillow against his left ear I asked him if he heard me but he gave no sign
BTS I struck the door of the state-room which had formerly been Mugridge's splintering and smashing the panels with the impact of my body
BTS White Fang's strength was developed by the long hours on trail and the steady toil at the sled
BTS On that point you will be tongue-tied though you will talk wordily enough about other things
BTS The coming of daylight dispelled his fears but increased his loneliness
BTS From what we can make out Van Dyke must have been a churchman
BTS At night when the god returned home White Fang would leave the warm sleeping-place he had burrowed in the snow in order to receive the friendly snap of fingers and the word of greeting
BTS What's the matter with America
BTS Weedon Scott saw and nodded
BTS The sailors now crowded boldly aft grinning and shuffling to watch the pummelling of the hated Cockney
BTS I drink to Life I drink to Death And smack my lips with song For when I die another 'I' shall pass the cup along
BTS The hunters were snickering but she looked at me with a sympathy in her eyes which more than compensated for Wolf Larsen's nastiness
BTS In order to discover the necessary area Nature had given him an enormous prognathous jaw
BTS Biedenbach and three young men who had been living in the refuge were out and over the mountain heavily armed and prepared for anything
BTS The Iron Heel had made up its mind to destroy us and there was no withstanding it
BTS Then quiet again though the gamins had startled and listened like young deer at the sound
BTS The close-reefed foresail worked
BTS As I say he discovered himself in splendid trim when I entered the cabin
BTS This be the sign of it Grey Beaver went on
BTS If I raised never a hand for that poor fool pointing astern to the tiny sail d'ye think I'm hungerin' for a broken head for a woman I never laid me eyes upon before this day
BTS They're weak as water if you want to know came the reply from one of the men
BTS It was really not a part of our organization
BTS The war-cloud hovered dark and ominous
BTS From his mother he had inherited the heavier proportions of the dog so that he weighed without any fat and without an ounce of superfluous flesh over ninety pounds
BTS The metaphysician explains the universe by himself the scientist explains himself by the universe
BTS Why we've got to make the best of the first of it and run down to our boats before our canvas is ripped out of us
BTS It is laughable the way this was accomplished
BTS I have spoken
BTS It touched the ends of his upstanding hair
BTS Even as late as 1907 it was considered that eleven groups dominated the country but this number was reduced by the amalgamation of the five railroad groups into a supreme combination of all the railroads
BTS Capital in all these countries has already consumed all it is able according to its nature
BTS What's up now
BTS She was even pleased
BTS Remember this surplus is over and above trade which articles of trade have been consumed
BTS By God we will go clear
BTS He has humor I thought and I almost forgave him his clothes
BTS Of course he answered
BTS It was large for a wolf its gaunt frame advertising the lines of an animal that was among the largest of its kind
BTS His pale wishy-washy eyes were swimming like lazy summer seas though what blissful visions they beheld were beyond my imagination
BTS into life insurance into banking
BTS The old familiar feelings of that time came back upon him surged up within him
BTS In the fall of 1917 we were not ready
BTS The first night in camp Joe the sour one was punished roundly a thing that Spitz had never succeeded in doing
BTS Stop and think a moment
BTS He looked at me with surprise and alarm then he seemed to wilt away
BTS Only I said it on the other side of my mouth
BTS First there has been no need to enforce it
BTS And not only did he learn by experience but instincts long dead became alive again
BTS Between gulps of the molten stuff I glanced down at my raw and bleeding chest and turned to the Scandinavian
BTS Countless attempts were made upon his life but he seemed to bear a charmed existence
BTS By some freak of the waters I had been swept clear under the forecastle-head and into the eyes
BTS and with the same cat-like swiftness he had slashed with his fangs and leaped clear
BTS Go for'ard and hard alee without any noise he said to me in a low voice
BTS For the first time she met him with a kindly manner
BTS He was too old too firmly moulded to become adept at expressing himself in new ways
BTS but Ernest controlled the tumult and made himself heard
BTS The day's events had prepared him for the unknown to manifest itself in most stupendous and unthinkable ways
BTS The wind blew the air clear again but no patch of sail broke the troubled surface
BTS The white-skinned fair-haired savages who created that terrible pantheon were of the same fibre as he
BTS In a dark passage this guide struck a match and holding it close to his face slipped back his mask
BTS For six months I was kept in prison though charged with no crime
BTS He acquired a reputation for wickedness amongst the man-animals themselves
BTS and he knew that she was used to having things thrown at her
BTS What if the First Revolt is lost
BTS Power
BTS One such potency was love
BTS I stepped out and advanced valiantly upon a long-maned bull in the midst of his wives
BTS The words were the last I ever heard him utter
BTS So come on an' shyke
BTS He performed his mental arithmetic aloud
BTS But instead of a sweeping victory with chief executive officers and majorities in all legislative bodies we found ourselves in the minority
BTS Jackson's arm was a fact of life
BTS But these wills were always broken and very often by the very lawyers that had drawn them up
BTS He passed out of the forest and into the moonlit open where were no shadows nor darknesses
BTS All the railroad unions entered into this combination with the oligarchs and it is of interest to note that the first definite application of the policy of profit-grabbing was made by a railroad union in the nineteenth century A
BTS Your hunter's decided to stay aboard awhile and doesn't want it pounding alongside
BTS He'll have to learn and he shall without postponement Scott said
BTS Something was happening
BTS The door was burst open
BTS The mob's coming back
BTS Won't that fix it
BTS Hammerfield was never up against anything like it in his life he laughed
BTS The forecastle scuttle was open
BTS Mit-sah alone gathering firewood in the forest encountered the boy that had been bitten
BTS That makes a hundred and fifty the saloon-keeper calculated
BTS It means hundreds of thousands a year to the stockholders he said
BTS Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck
BTS And again the unprecedented was established
BTS He tripped them up with facts ambuscaded them with facts bombarded them with broadsides of facts
BTS They had many homes scattered over the country in the mountains on lakes and by the sea
BTS He now reasoned it
BTS Next morning No
BTS More I heard of him afterward
BTS Fresh from these two masters I met Ernest and related my experience
BTS There were still several hours of grey daylight and sombre twilight and he utilised them in chopping an enormous supply of fire-wood
BTS Her husband had an accident and was laid up in hospital three months
BTS We were not mere gloomy conspirators
BTS Out of necessity we had to punish our traitors
BTS They were reeling apart
BTS But the situation of the pack was desperate
BTS Wolf Larsen put his finger to his lips as a sign for silence and the eyes closed again
BTS She is in a class by herself and not amenable to the ordinary standards of the revolutionists
BTS Why did you do that
BTS In Avis Everhard's words they could literally make a man over
BTS But I say Hump he called down
BTS Francois was angry
BTS And it was a long long night weary and dreary and long
BTS He too made a low flight but he was in luck for they failed seriously to puncture his balloon
BTS I'm not saying anything O'Connor replied except that I'm president of the Machinists' Association and it's my business to consider the interests of the men I represent that's all
BTS His wrenched shoulder-blade untreated and unrested went from bad to worse till finally Hal shot him with the big Colt's revolver
BTS Kowalt suggested
BTS Here we had carried many loads of gravel from the creek-bed so that it was dry and warm a pleasant basking place
BTS And so we dodged about the deck hand in hand like a couple of children chased by a wicked ogre till Wolf Larsen evidently in disgust left the deck for the cabin
BTS He made a long pause plainly overcome by the thought that was in him and nervous how best to express it
BTS The young slip of a gale having wetted our gills proceeded to moderate
BTS Of course the newspapers of the land lived up to the reactionary policy of the ruling class and the destroyed socialist press was misrepresented and vilified while the Black Hundreds were represented as true patriots and saviours of society
BTS Likewise he was made dizzy by this abrupt and tremendous extension of space
BTS Little did I dream of the awful manner in which I was to see him once again--the fleeting glimpse of him in the whirlwind carnage of the Chicago Commune
BTS Also he appreciated the power with which they administered the law
BTS Miss Brewster and myself
BTS Yes you did father meditated
BTS They're pretty wise them dogs
BTS I tried to break in on the man's morbid thoughts by calling him away but he smiled sadly at me and refused to obey
BTS But the haunting familiarity of those shoulders and that silver hair
BTS What a spectacle he was
BTS That's your look-out
BTS We took our place at once as agents-provocateurs in the scheme of the Iron Heel
BTS It exploded right at my feet and yet it did not kill me
BTS And under their direction and generously rewarded will toil the artists
BTS Maybe he is in Chicago now and all is well
BTS He arose and related the history of the suppression of the book
BTS Thus it was that in the fall of 1912 the socialist leaders with the exception of Ernest decided that the end of capitalism had come
BTS It struck fairly nearly knocking the man over but he did not obey
BTS They carried their whole stock in trade from door to door
BTS These and the other bay cities practically composed one community
BTS We may have made mistakes but if so very rarely
BTS He kept a summer cottage in Mill Valley under the shadow of Mount Tamalpais and never occupied it except when he loafed through the winter months and read Nietzsche and Schopenhauer to rest his brain
BTS Battle royal raged and the ministers grew red-faced and excited especially at the moments when Ernest called them romantic philosophers shadow-projectors and similar things
BTS He ripped out a savage oath and clenched his fist as though about to strike me
BTS And you are also I continued a man one could not trust in the least thing where it was possible for a selfish interest to intervene
BTS Oh I haven't quit the fight Mr
BTS Had it not been my custom to run up to see him every Saturday afternoon and to stop over till Monday morning this particular January Monday morning would not have found me afloat on San Francisco Bay
BTS He smiled his twisted smile and Maud her eyes wide with horror was compelled to turn away her head
BTS order
BTS It was the weak joint in their armor
BTS Day and night the smoke of burning farms warehouses villages and cities filled the sky
BTS It seemed impossible that it could continue to live yet with each dizzying sweep it did achieve the impossible
BTS He has delivered his message Ernest cried
BTS He snarled more menacingly crouched still lower and still the hand descended
BTS I asked
BTS that you have lifted it from the water swung it through the air and deposited it here where it belongs
BTS They know where their hides is safe he said
BTS Developed himself by peeling potatoes and washing dishes
BTS Later his feet grew hard to the trail and the worn-out foot-gear was thrown away
BTS After the rent it's not so bad
BTS He never barked
BTS Down the opposite side of the street tottered a wretched slave
BTS To Buck it was nothing new or strange this scene of old time
BTS Not so was the conduct of George Leach the erstwhile cabin-boy
BTS Nay the trusts did more than stand firm
BTS so did part of the shark's
BTS It burst and about his feet and mine bounced and rolled a flood of potatoes
BTS He was impelled to do them and did not reason about them at all
BTS I have often envied that young man of yours for his actual knowledge of the proletariat
BTS He tripped and was pulled off his feet
BTS I have yet to tell of the stirring times of the winter of 1912
BTS A quick snappy sea was being kicked up by the wind a condition which prevented fine shooting
BTS CHAPTER XIII THE GENERAL STRIKE Of course Ernest was elected to Congress in the great socialist landslide that took place in the fall of 1912
BTS The proud Chicago proletariat lived up to its ancient boast
BTS His whole frame shook with the struggle
BTS But the cub did not think in man-fashion
BTS His head was bowed
BTS and here in advance I challenge you to show that my mathematics are wrong
BTS nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that direction as in the direction of Charles's political prejudices
BTS White Fang was in the process of finding himself
BTS I should have known the opportunity but it never came
BTS Oh ho he said a nest of revolutionists--and quite a hornet's nest it would seem
BTS Why
BTS The hand at my throat relaxed
BTS Thus the dog behind could never catch up with the one in front
BTS This was to be my first night on the mattress and I knew I should sleep the sweeter because she had made it
BTS she burst out a moment later
BTS Johansen called vainly for him to come down
BTS Iron steel coal machinery and transportation constitute the backbone of the whole industrial fabric
BTS Buck held on till he was on a line straight above Thornton
BTS But One Ear broke into a run across the snow his traces trailing behind him
BTS All the work was in the preparation
BTS He had lost his voice or he was losing it
BTS These muscles were made to grip and tear and destroy living things that get between me and life
BTS Every advance on his part was accompanied by a corresponding retreat on her part
BTS And his carelessness might have been due to the familiarity of the trail to the pool
BTS At the end of fifteen minutes the carriage swung in through a stone gateway and on between a double row of arched and interlacing walnut trees
BTS The next he knew he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance
BTS And the beauty of it is that you will then add to our strength
BTS Haskins
BTS He was aware of a certain strange satisfaction as though some need were being gratified as though some void in his being were being filled
BTS Convinced of this I toiled with him at the revolution and did not exhaust my energy in alleviating the social ills that continuously arose from the injustice of the system
BTS At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out fires were built and breakfast was eaten
BTS The country was on the verge of hard times caused by a series of prosperous years wherein the difficulty of disposing abroad of the unconsumed surplus had become increasingly difficult
BTS And the woman I loved was Maud Brewster
BTS Nor was she above slashing his shoulder sharply on occasion
BTS Ah it is growing dark and darker
BTS He knew that he had responded to something from without that his sensibility had been touched by a changing something in his environment
BTS I'll not deny that I helped to give her that impression
BTS Especially interesting was Mr
BTS He turned and leaped silently among his enemies
BTS His throat was afflicted by rigid spasms his mouth opened and in a heart-broken cry bubbled up his loneliness and fear his grief for Kiche all his past sorrows and miseries as well as his apprehension of sufferings and dangers to come
BTS And still we walked in immediate quietude
BTS He had entered the fog to windward of the steamer and while the steamer had blindly driven on into the fog in the chance of catching him he had come about and out of his shelter and was now running down to re-enter to leeward
BTS Thomas Mugridge sir an' at yer service
BTS He oppressed the weak but he respected the strong
BTS Not for nothing had he surrendered himself body and soul to Grey Beaver
BTS He made no movement whatever simply stood there staring at me
BTS And here I have been lying warm as toast
BTS First comes the Plutocracy which is composed of wealthy bankers railway magnates corporation directors and trust magnates
BTS You will find him an interested listener and no fool
BTS And best of all I felt myself the protector of my loved one
BTS and the men like butchers plying their trade naked and red of arm and hand hard at work with ripping and flensing-knives removing the skins from the pretty sea-creatures they had killed
BTS I had seen the mechanism of the primitive fighting beast and I was as strongly impressed as if I had seen the engines of a great battleship or Atlantic liner
BTS My first thought was that a man who had come through a collision and rubbed shoulders with death merited more attention than I received
BTS Not only were we hungry but we were now suffering from thirst
BTS White man's dogs would have no show against him Scott went on
BTS He was always a little demon of fury when he chanced upon a stray ptarmigan
BTS Grey Beaver continued to beat White Fang continued to snarl
BTS But the gates of speech were closed and we too rose from the table and laughed awkwardly
BTS Then Mr
BTS You called my speech fallacy
BTS White Fang on the verge of retreat would have retreated leaving the meat to him
BTS I saw Mr
BTS And he felt shame that the man-animals should be laughing at him
BTS They did not bother to look after the causes of his conduct
BTS And then there arose before me another figure the Christ
BTS And yet I was conscious of a slight shock or hurt in that she was able to do the thing I had begged her to do and which she had notably disliked
BTS And now we shall have breakfast I said
BTS Well
BTS He's all in poor devil muttered the master
BTS and this mandate down out of the depths of Time he obeyed
BTS hated him for all the real and fancied favours he received
BTS In spite of taking in washing she got behind in her rent
BTS I asked
BTS There was a rush
BTS It was not a column but a mob an awful river that filled the street the people of the abyss mad with drink and wrong up at last and roaring for the blood of their masters
BTS I held out my hand
BTS But they had been domesticated for generations
BTS How can he be tempted to get drunk and refuse to get drunk
BTS He picked one up from the pan
BTS Many months had gone by since he passed into the possession of Beauty Smith and in all that period he had never known a moment of freedom except at the times he had been loosed to fight with other dogs
BTS A hasty drawing back always resulted accompanied by angry yelps and frightened snarls when a well-aimed brand struck and scorched a too daring animal
BTS It squirmed about like some huge many-legged spider and swayed back and forth to the regular roll of the vessel
BTS Then he heard a great outcry of snarls and yelps
BTS So large was his following that he managed to take possession of the empty shell of the old Democratic Party
BTS And the absurd thing about it is that you have repeated these phrases so often that you believe them
BTS Matt examined him
BTS They got out of the way gave trail to the grown dogs and gave up meat to them under compulsion
BTS I said solemnly
BTS They cannot dispose of these surpluses to one another
BTS He bristled suspiciously but the master warned him that all was well
BTS And now we come to the point
BTS Now gentlemen follow me
BTS Jordan's book I believe
BTS The cabin still rang with his voice as he stood there swaying his bronzed face shining his head up and dominant and his eyes golden and masculine intensely masculine and insistently soft flashing upon Maud at the door
BTS One result of this was to make White Fang more ferocious and indomitable and more solitary
BTS But he was dead now nor did the ranch descend to his children
BTS For that matter it was her presence which enabled Smoke to act as he did
BTS for he was a civilized dog an unduly civilized dog and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it
BTS Day broke and found me wan-eyed and the ocean lashed white the boat pitching almost on end to its drag
BTS It's by hard work I got to my present exalted position
BTS It had gripped savagely hold of him and was about to wreak upon him some terrific hurt
BTS Hunters there are who fail to return to the camp and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow greater than the prints of any wolf
BTS A soldier leaped from it carrying something carefully in his hands
BTS Always they broke camp in the dark and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them
BTS As quietly as was possible I clewed up the topsails lowered the flying jib and staysail backed the jib over and flattened the mainsail
BTS He never asked himself the question
BTS All that saved White Fang from death was the loose skin of his neck and the thick fur that covered it
BTS Grey Beaver's wrath was terrible
BTS It was heartbreaking only Buck's heart was unbreakable
BTS As the hunting man-animals went out and came back so she would come back to the village some time
BTS This breaking of wills was a peculiar feature of the period
BTS It will make it easier for you to act your part
BTS Half the load and twice the dogs if they ever expected to reach Dawson was what was said
BTS They were known as chechaquos and they always wilted at the application of the name
BTS Grey Beaver would not have camped on the near side of the Mackenzie and White Fang would have passed by and gone on either to die or to find his way to his wild brothers and become one of them a wolf to the end of his days
BTS I didn't want to disappoint her
BTS There were no survivors
BTS When one was beaten into insensibility or killed the survivor took the money
BTS Her face was of the sort that cannot but look well under all circumstances
BTS The sound arose from his great lungs and dominated the human tempest
BTS he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot and finally he was deposited in an express car
BTS He was not prone to rashness and precipitate action
BTS CHAPTER XXIII THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS Suddenly a change came over the face of things
BTS He was laughing at me
BTS Set men at all the sheets
BTS In a hundred segregated traps were the comrades thus held while the work of subjugating them went on
BTS But most potent in his education was the cuff of the master's hand the censure of the master's voice
BTS She sniffed noses with him and even condescended to leap about and frisk and play with him in quite puppyish fashion
BTS Reversion
BTS They are afraid of this Ghost Dog for it has cunning greater than they stealing from their camps in fierce winters robbing their traps slaying their dogs and defying their bravest hunters
BTS She became a pest to him like a policeman following him around the stable and the hounds and if he even so much as glanced curiously at a pigeon or chicken bursting into an outcry of indignation and wrath
BTS The sight of him made me doubly angry
BTS He shook it and grinned sheepishly at the courier who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they were beaten
BTS You have hardened your hearts
BTS Free play and plenty of room
BTS They did not despise him
BTS This is not a football field
BTS I sleep in cheap lodging houses the Bishop went on
BTS Sight and scent became remarkably keen while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril
BTS and it was not till next morning that she made her appearance
BTS Ernest had his hand on the pulse of events even more closely than the rest of the socialists and within two days the first blow was struck
BTS In mobs composed wholly of themselves they fired and looted buildings and factories
BTS And White Fang allowed himself to be driven away
BTS But father was wise enough to see it
BTS Then he added Still well but not so well that argument of yours
BTS Kill myself
BTS The name and its magic signified nothing to him
BTS You must have seen what happened
BTS Joshua made the sun stand still upon Gibeon but you would outdo Joshua
BTS The place had the empty and musty feel and smell usual to a dwelling no longer inhabited
BTS You are a man utterly without what the world calls morals
BTS For she knew that in the lynx's lair was a litter of kittens and she knew the lynx for a fierce bad-tempered creature and a terrible fighter
BTS Oh you brave brave woman I said when I saw the life coming back into her face
BTS Also he had once nearly had an eye poked out by a toddling papoose
BTS What's her name then
BTS The trail they had broken into the country was packed hard by later journeyers
BTS By the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation the sled was a quarter of a mile away
BTS Then I told him the whole circumstance how my clothes had been left to dry in the galley and how later I was nearly beaten by the cook when I mentioned the matter
BTS Behind it is the fine hand of Wickson and behind him the hands of greater men than he
BTS And see that you serve no more slops was his parting injunction
BTS I confess I had never had such a question asked me before nor had I ever canvassed it
BTS He visited Grey Beaver's camp often and hidden under his coat was always a black bottle or so
BTS He stopped and regarded her all of an intentness and eagerness physically expressed that slowly faded out of him as she turned her head and gazed back at the camp
BTS Several weeks later Joseph Parkhurst the prison doctor who had just been appointed proved himself to be a member of one of the Fighting Groups
BTS It is nothing to what will come Ernest went on if you persist in your policy of having these socialists and radicals of all sorts at your house myself included
BTS He was a fierce little cub
BTS And at this moment Latimer called down the scuttles Hump
BTS L
BTS Her power of recuperation was wonderful
BTS He had never seen the whole poem and he had tried vainly to learn its authorship
BTS CHAPTER VII THE BISHOP'S VISION The Bishop is out of hand Ernest wrote me
BTS The sermon was of the same order as the ones he had preached long before his eyes had seen visions
BTS You have been blind and greedy
BTS I remember once on deck in bright day touching him on the shoulder as preliminary to giving an order
BTS CHAPTER XXVIII There is no need of going into an extended recital of our suffering in the small boat during the many days we were driven and drifted here and there willy-nilly across the ocean
BTS The footprint was much larger than the one his own feet made and he knew that in the wake of such a trail there was little meat for him
BTS and he did see me for he sprang to the wheel thrusting the other man aside and whirled it round and round hand over hand at the same time shouting orders of some sort
BTS And truly the war would have done all these things had it not been for the socialists
BTS Yet the warm blood of the rabbit tasted good in his mouth
BTS I have been looking up Jackson's case I said abruptly
BTS In that instant the lynx struck
BTS There were a myriad devices for catching dust and only a few devices for getting rid of it
BTS We could see the front of their column filling the street from gutter to gutter as the last war-automobile fled past
BTS he snorted
BTS He whined placatingly squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions and even ventured as a bribe for peace to lick Buck's face with his warm wet tongue
BTS I tiptoed across the cabin and to the top of the stairs
BTS But when it comes to sociology--my trade--you are down in the dirt at my feet
BTS There was a correspondence in rhythm between the growls and the movements of the man's hands
BTS Poor betrayed labor
BTS Here was the original cause for the voyages of discovery
BTS Yes I have considered yours frequently I answered puzzling over what I had seen in her eyes and puzzled by her sudden change of subject
BTS Then in desperation I abandoned the attempt to reef the mainsail and resolved to try the experiment of heaving to under the close-reefed foresail
BTS We can never get that anchor up in this narrow place once it has left the bottom I said
BTS They threw clubs at him
BTS Enormous numbers of men were employed as watchmen to protect property
BTS then would they be capable of softness and tenderness and sympathy
BTS His old code of conduct was changing
BTS It was dark and he could not see it but he recognised it by the touch
BTS He said nothing
BTS And it is equally true that so long as you and yours and those that come after you have power that labor shall remain in the dirt
BTS This fund became a sort of text-book that was passed on a part of the curriculum as it were of the school of Revolution
BTS At the first hint of conflict the whole team drew together and faced him
BTS But there was one trial in White Fang's life Collie
BTS They were of the active rich and not the idle and they were fighters
BTS The dog's mine
BTS I'll deny it and there are no witnesses
BTS The other puppies came sprawling toward him to Collie's great disgust
BTS Still no one answered
BTS Do you know I sometimes catch myself wishing that I too were blind to the facts of life and only knew its fancies and illusions
BTS Better so I answered
BTS But Bill was stubborn and he ate a dry breakfast washed down with mumbled curses at One Ear for the trick he had played
BTS Wolf Larsen had been smitten with one of his headaches and I stood at the wheel from morning until evening sailing across the ocean after the last lee boat and heaving to and picking it and the other five up without command or suggestion from him
BTS There was an emphasis on the tried and a pleading little note in her voice
BTS My hands however are a spectacle for grief
BTS They know their business better'n we do an' they ain't a-holdin' our trail this way for their health
BTS I was sent for
BTS I am not afraid the sailor retorted a slight angry flush rising through his sunburn
BTS Old memories were coming upon him fast and he was stirring to them as of old he stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows
BTS I know I said
BTS It ate away from beneath
BTS I followed with a quaking heart
BTS Two minutes from the time Curly went down the last of her assailants were clubbed off
BTS Such was the scene as we came upon it
BTS Of the passage from the galley to the cabin I knew nothing
BTS There were so many of the man-animals men women and children all making noises and irritations
BTS Father was branded as a nihilist and an anarchist and in one cartoon that was copied widely he was portrayed waving a red flag at the head of a mob of long-haired wild-eyed men who bore in their hands torches knives and dynamite bombs
BTS It was evidently his intention to play with them a lesson I took it in lieu of a beating though a dangerous lesson for the frail craft stood in momentary danger of being overwhelmed
BTS Leach stood their fears and reproaches for some time
BTS I ran my eyes over them twenty men all told
BTS You refer to a very dark period in human history
BTS The man early discovered White Fang's susceptibility to laughter and made it a point after painfully tricking him to laugh at him
BTS How much of this can labor buy back
BTS To Buck's surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him
BTS The mid-air part of one great deed I saw however and that was the balloon attacks made by our comrades on the fortresses
BTS You know that your strength is an empty shell
BTS Jackson himself did not impress me when I hunted him out
BTS They were very lean mere skin-bags stretched over bony frames with strings for muscles so lean that Henry found it in his mind to marvel that they still kept their feet and did not collapse forthright in the snow
BTS In the meantime the socialists held firm
BTS But of Johnson's grumbling at the slop-chest I knew nothing so that what I witnessed came with a shock of sudden surprise
BTS At the first hint of darkness he hastened to make a camp and he saw to it that he had a generous supply of firewood
BTS He dogged his master's heels whenever he left the cabin and haunted the front stoop when he remained inside
BTS and when they had put it on the back and covered it over with a couple of other bundles she discovered overlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very sack and they unloaded again
BTS And it lost Jackson's case for him
BTS I slept again and the next I knew I was on top of the building
BTS It's too bad but it served him right Scott said hastily
BTS and he frightened unaware of what constituted this new onslaught struck back ferociously and in still greater fright ripping down the side of the she-wolf's muzzle
BTS He was woefully changed
BTS Everhard was right in the essential particulars though his date of the introduction of the bill is in error
BTS Father insisted on laboratory methods
BTS To his mind this was power unusual power inconceivable and beyond the natural power that was godlike
BTS It reminded me of Taine yet I knew the man had never heard of that brilliant though dangerous thinker
BTS It was invested with the woe of unnumbered generations this plaint by which Buck was so strangely stirred
BTS The terms were simple
BTS Buck duplicated the manoeuvre this time to the left
BTS After this Jim Hall went to live in the incorrigible cell
BTS CHAPTER I I scarcely know where to begin though I sometimes facetiously place the cause of it all to Charley Furuseth's credit
BTS She occupied a chair right up to the front and several times she turned her head toward one or another of her CONFRERES and smiled her appreciation of the remarks
BTS But this tacit conspiracy grew large
BTS Weedon Scott had believed that he was quick enough to avoid any snap or slash
BTS There lies your strength and your value--to the capitalist class
BTS Nor will the eternal movelessness that is coming to me be made easier or harder by the sacrifices or selfishnesses of the time when I was yeasty and acrawl
BTS He was in too quickly for that and if he missed was out again too quickly
BTS The next morning I dug a shallow ditch around the tent and an hour later a sudden gust of wind whipping over the rocky wall behind us picked up the tent and smashed it down on the sand thirty yards away
BTS They were expressions of life and life is always happy when it is expressing itself
BTS It would have smashed out a double row of spikes
BTS I said I wouldn't if ary dog turned up missin' an' I won't
BTS I demanded
BTS In retaliation the survivors meted out to Donnelly the death he had earned by his treason
BTS The proletariat has grown up outside the Church and without the Church
BTS But the moment laughter was turned upon him he would fly into a most terrible rage
BTS she murmured you startled me and you are cruel
BTS Pish
BTS After a time the she-wolf began to grow restless
BTS Agents-provocateurs all right was the officer's conclusion
BTS They came up to where I was standing by the entrance to the companion-way
BTS There was an angry gleam in the hunter's eye but he turned on his heel and entered the steerage companion-way where he remained looking upward
BTS I took up a pair of trousers and examined her work
BTS You've made terms with the enemy that's what you've done
BTS We're in for a sou'-easter
BTS Let me show you
BTS Ballingford paraphrased
BTS He could not endure a prolonged contact with another body
BTS An' he went like greased lightnin' once he got started
BTS He was a slave to the industrial machine and it stamped his life out worked him to death
BTS He led a lost cause and he was not afraid of God's thunderbolts Wolf Larsen was saying
BTS Hope was alive again in my breast and I looked about me with greater coolness
BTS Leave me alone till morning
BTS A singer in deeds
BTS of going out with the boats from the time I could crawl
BTS to the good and to the clean and to the unclean
BTS Ha
BTS He talked soothingly to him but not for long then slowly put out his hand rested it on White Fang's head and resumed the interrupted patting
BTS And Buck was merciless
BTS He continued to grin with a sardonic humour with a cynical mockery and defiance
BTS I was conscious only of an overmastering rage
BTS Here the squaws came to his aid and White Fang transformed into a raging demon was finally driven off only by a fusillade of stones
BTS Now suppose labor having received its fifty dollars wanted to buy back shoes
BTS Why I'm getting everything ready for re-stepping the masts I replied easily as though it were the simplest project imaginable
BTS I am just learning for myself
BTS But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog
BTS It was an unprecedented thing on sealing-schooners where it is the custom for the hunters to rank unofficially as officers
BTS There were many persons to be considered
BTS During the period that he waited vainly for his mother to come back he led the pack many a wild chase through the adjacent woods
BTS The first blow was aimed at these special editions and it was a crushing one
BTS Latimer reached down with his free hand
BTS Aint got no spunk left
BTS Quite as often he understepped and stubbed his feet
BTS He called Hans and Pete to him
BTS Ernest demanded bluntly
BTS I asked
BTS And one day catching one of his enemies alone on the edge of the woods he managed by repeatedly overthrowing him and attacking the throat to cut the great vein and let out the life
BTS But under it all they were men penetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence puny adventurers bent on colossal adventure pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and pulseless as the abysses of space
BTS A second cry arose piercing the silence with needle-like shrillness
BTS As it was it seemed inconceivable that I could bear the weight I did and live
BTS He had hardly ceased reading when Louis put his head into the companion-way and whispered down Be easy will ye
BTS Wot you t'ink eh Perrault
BTS He shot a glance in my direction to see if I was taking it in and went on
BTS To this day I do not know what became of that half-mile of humanity--whether it was blotted out by some frightful bolt of war whether it was scattered and destroyed piecemeal or whether it escaped
BTS And in addition to everything there was his studying
BTS And so because he needed a god and because he preferred Weedon Scott to Beauty Smith White Fang remained
BTS Three copies of it are extant
BTS I could see the vain beat and flutter of her as she strove pressing her face against his breast to escape from him
BTS Yet fear was in him
BTS and by poverty is meant that condition in life in which through lack of food and adequate shelter the mere standard of working efficiency cannot be maintained
BTS I could see him only as living always and dominating always fighting and destroying himself surviving
BTS what was dear to the master was to be cherished by White Fang and guarded carefully
BTS In appearance and rhetoric he was old-fashioned but in imagination and knowledge and resource he was as young as the latest statute
BTS There were the spare oars very true
BTS and the second day saw them booming up the Yukon well on their way to Pelly
BTS Had he moved attempted to drop down the companion-way I know I would have shot him
BTS At first I thought of knocking then I remembered my ostensible errand and resolved to carry it out
BTS A devilish pandemonium reigned--shrieks curses and cries of death while above all rose the churning rattle of machine-guns and the put-a-put put-a-put of rifles
BTS Still the punishment delayed
BTS He shook his head in a bantering way and regarded me with laughing eyes
BTS I was to learn as time went by that there were many cases similar to hers and many worse hidden away in the monstrous depths of the tenements in my neighborhood
BTS He wandered through the village recognising with staid satisfaction the various gods he had known before the long journey
BTS You are right he said
BTS A Mexican dish referred to occasionally in the literature of the times
BTS You are impotent
BTS Promptly came the reply that there was no record on the books of father's owning any stock and a polite request for more explicit information
BTS He could not quite suppress a snarl but he made no offer to snap
BTS The pain from my hurt knee was agonizing
BTS with the Judge's grandsons a sort of pompous guardianship
BTS The hunters on the other hand had stronger and more diversified faces with hard lines and the marks of the free play of passions
BTS Every member had his work to do in the world and this work he was compelled to do
BTS The snarls ceased
BTS I had no sensation whatever in my lower limbs while a chilling numbness was wrapping about my heart and creeping into it
BTS It went faster and faster and the shorter his money-sack grew the shorter grew his temper
BTS and with the Judge himself a stately and dignified friendship
BTS I can hear him now as I shall always hear him the primal melancholy vibrant in his voice as he read I gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces
BTS O'Connor the president of the Association of Machinists had been foremost of the six leaders present in refusing to give such assurance
BTS It was a small live thing and he had no fear
BTS And still we lived and the boat lived and the wind blew unabated
BTS I shall prove if what you say is so that the Church has erred through ignorance
BTS It began to look as though the battle were over
BTS Did you lack ambition
BTS And even I felt a great joy surge up within me
BTS Whenever one made an attempt to break back toward the water I headed it off
BTS For that matter they were all loafing Buck John Thornton and Skeet and Nig waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to Dawson
BTS The vessels came together before I could follow his advice
BTS Primitive man was a puny creature hiding in the crevices of the rocks
BTS Your desire for profits which is sheer selfishness you metamorphose into altruistic solicitude for suffering humanity
BTS But a change came over the face of the dream for a dream I told myself it must be
BTS And how we worked
BTS Bill shoved his cup aside
BTS He was too busy and happy to know that he was happy
BTS Yes Mr
BTS He dived out of the galley door or glided rather with a swiftness and smoothness of gait that struck me as being not so much cat-like as oily
BTS The man who had spoken to him was clearly a Cockney with the clean lines and weakly pretty almost effeminate face of the man who has absorbed the sound of Bow Bells with his mother's milk
BTS Later when he had grown more formidable he wanted to eat the hawk
BTS Thanks to my brother Death I've lighted on a fortune
BTS He so warm in spirit was dominated by that cold and forbidding philosophy materialistic monism
BTS He walked less softly among the grown dogs
BTS This then is our answer
BTS Then Wolf Larsen's other hand reached up and clutched the edge of the scuttle
BTS And there is no reason that the division should not be amicable
BTS Six lonely months I spent in the refuge but they were not idle months
BTS It came hard going as it did counter to much that was strong and dominant in his own nature
BTS The Iron Heel is getting bold
BTS and yet such is the paradox I never wanted so much to live as right now when I place the least value upon my own life
BTS Behind them came the soldiers with their automatic rifles
BTS Life as he had known it not only had had no place in it for much that he now did
BTS The hunter had managed to get the boat before the wind again but we ran down upon it going at least two feet to its one
BTS Strike-breaking as an occupation will cease
BTS Come on now right here amongst ourselves and be honest for once
BTS They tried to lead the conversation away into easier channels
BTS Nothing had happened
BTS He lets me take the work home now that I am old and the noise of the machine bothers my head
BTS To the consternation of his congregation his first sermon was quite similar to the address he had given before the Convention
BTS CHAPTER III THE OUTCAST Lip-lip continued so to darken his days that White Fang became wickeder and more ferocious than it was his natural right to be
BTS I smiled in superior fashion and slacking off on one of the boom-guys and taking in on the other swung the mast perfectly in the centre of the deck
BTS White Fang slunk into camp one evening and dropped down with a sigh of content
BTS The water was cold so cold that it was painful
BTS In the cabin he lay on the floor near the stove without interest in food in Matt nor in life
BTS The Church does not protest against it Ernest replied
BTS ' 'I closed the cab door for you' I answered
BTS Only he did not know it for an entrance
BTS Weedon Scott listened
BTS But the mystery and oppressiveness vanished after the first few seconds of waking when I identified the missing something as the wind
BTS But he returned more fixed than ever in his determination to preach the message of the Church
BTS It had come down to him from a remote ancestry through a thousand thousand lives
BTS He absurdly insisted upon my addressing him as Mr
BTS I had succumbed and slept where I sat in the stern-sheets
BTS Yes it has been a bad summer
BTS One can only dimly feel these things
BTS There were days and nights when Ernest never closed his eyes in sleep
BTS You talk verbosely in antiquated terminology of your love of liberty and all the while you wear the scarlet livery of the Iron Heel
BTS Now the unknown had caught tight hold of him
BTS Pray do not interrupt me he wrote
BTS I was now concerned with fear for myself
BTS It was a slight uphill climb for the foresail peaked high
BTS This use of our given names had come about quite as a matter of course and was as unpremeditated as it was natural
BTS The men rode and ran by turn and the dogs were kept on the jump with but infrequent stoppages
BTS Blood dripped from every finger-end while the nails were broken to the quick
BTS I asked
BTS Common decency
BTS I don't know I replied
BTS I noticed a black discoloration still faintly visible under Johansen's eye a mark of the thrashing he had received a few nights before from the sailor
BTS But almost as quickly as it had arisen the commotion died away
BTS He had miscalculated once but he would not be guilty of it a second time
BTS It could sell still at a slight profit when we were selling at actual loss
BTS The master's lips tightened as he faced the disagreeable task
BTS So I say the work was never done
BTS And still I hesitated
BTS But Wolf Larsen regained control of himself by an exertion of his remarkable will
BTS At last Grey Beaver withheld his hand
BTS He smiled indulgently
BTS She could not but know it as she swiftly drew away her hands and yet could not forbear one quick searching look before she turned away her eyes
BTS Then I shall smile no more he said calmly
BTS For two reasons Ernest said
BTS Prosperity always brought calamity
BTS He was so eminent a scientist that such an announcement coupled with the reason for his enforced resignation would have created somewhat of a furor all over the world
BTS But it is dark in here she said the next moment her shoulders shrinking with a little involuntary shiver
BTS And you
BTS He had wasted no time with his teeth
BTS That night he waited for the master to return
BTS I was continuing
BTS I hardly think that is fair was the objection
BTS The grey cub could not understand this
BTS You are shivering now
BTS Go to the cook and learn your duties
BTS And before he could recover I'd have him bound hard and fast
BTS He learned quickly
BTS Before she went away the she-wolf had found this lair but the signs told her that the lynx was inside and she had not dared to venture in
BTS Grey Beaver was breaking the lump of tallow in half
BTS And it is of course over-estimated since it is of necessity prejudiced in its own favour
BTS Wolf Larsen I said sternly for the first time addressing him by this his most familiar name I am unable to shoot a helpless unresisting man
BTS The little lawyer glared at me a moment and then the belligerence faded out of his face
BTS Three times the hand essayed to write but fumbled hopelessly
BTS I like you a hundred per cent
BTS held its convention that night in San Francisco
BTS He kept it in his hand and steadfastly proffered it
BTS Night came on and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day
BTS I selected mainly from the canned goods and by the time I was ready willing hands were extended from above to receive what I passed up
BTS Kind of strange colour for a wolf was Bill's criticism
BTS Mr
BTS Dave and Sol-leks were unaffected but the rest of the team went from bad to worse
BTS We were sailing on through the fog without a look-out and without lights
BTS That is what we are in business for
BTS And this out of all remains I did not fail
BTS When running more freely with the wind astern abeam or on the quarter it will be necessary for me to steer
BTS He had to learn that he must not touch the chickens that belonged to other gods
BTS Thus by carrying this tackle to the windlass I could raise and lower the end of the boom at will the butt always remaining stationary and by means of guys I could swing the boom from side to side
BTS She leaned against me so light and lily-frail and as her trembling eased away it seemed as though I became aware of prodigious strength
BTS Maud took an active part in the drive and with her cries and flourishings of the broken oar was of considerable assistance
BTS The youth of the race seemed burgeoning in me over-civilized man that I was and I lived for myself the old hunting days and forest nights of my remote and forgotten ancestry
BTS He deserves to die I cried out
BTS They were describing the earth as the centre of the universe while the scientists were discovering America and probing space for the stars and the laws of the stars
BTS Dat Buck two devils was Francois's rejoinder
BTS But you will observe that I didn't come back the way I went
BTS It was the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the work and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity
BTS Mathematical certainty
BTS After my interview with Smith I went to my father's office in the Chemistry Building and there encountered Ernest
BTS His face was shining his eyes flashing with excitement as he translated into articulate language the speech of the horns and sirens
BTS One of the Indians arose and walked over to him and stooped above him
BTS Asmunsen
BTS About his neck was put a moss-stuffed collar which was connected by two pulling-traces to a strap that passed around his chest and over his back
BTS Then Francois went up to where Sol-leks stood and called to Buck
BTS He shrank down under it
BTS The point is that the strength of the Oligarchy today lies in its satisfied conception of its own righteousness
BTS I'm going to Dawson
BTS She was pretty and soft but she weighed one hundred and twenty pounds a lusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and starving animals
BTS You'll get used to such things in time
BTS Do you know what will happen to Farley and his strike-breakers
BTS but Ernest shrugged his shoulders and with an I have nothing to say went on eating salted almonds
BTS and the boats were hoisted in amid curses which if curses had power would have settled Death Larsen for all eternity Dead and damned for a dozen iv eternities commented Louis his eyes twinkling up at me as he rested from hauling taut the lashings of his boat
BTS And the thought of it was so much added power
BTS My best you may be sure which wasn't much under the circumstances
BTS They were superior creatures of a verity gods
BTS All about me were nobleness of purpose and heroism of effort and my days and nights were sunshine and starshine all fire and dew with before my eyes ever burning and blazing the Holy Grail Christ's own Grail the warm human long-suffering and maltreated but to be rescued and saved at the last
BTS I felt the mattress-like growth of beard on my neck knew that the sleeve of my coat was ripped that a button was missing from the throat of the blue shirt I wore
BTS Then I smiled
BTS They were segregated in their own districts and beaten into submission
BTS She rushed upon White Fang in frenzied wrath
BTS Though he followed her he was still dubious and he could not forbear an occasional halt in order more carefully to study the warning
BTS But I was not born Norwegian
BTS A man who tried to smuggle it in would lose his job
BTS I mean that there is a shadow of something colossal and menacing that even now is beginning to fall across the land
BTS Suddenly there was a deafening roar
BTS What then when every country in the world has an unconsumed surplus
BTS Only this stream I gazed upon did not flow
BTS But he mustn't lose any chance that might be of help to him Judge Scott exclaimed
BTS A man's half licked when he says he is
BTS The warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness
BTS It came to my ears as a muffled roar
BTS Their innate sense of right has been violated Maud Brewster said joining the conversation
BTS Well where's all hands
BTS The wives and daughters of these lesser oligarchs were legion and it was decided that I should assume the disguise of such a one
BTS What immortal end did you serve
BTS By this means he announced that he was prepared to retaliate for any hurt he might receive
BTS so my sisters and father had called me during my childhood
BTS White Fang felt fear mounting in him again
BTS And it was the same with our organization
BTS wherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans with Buck and half a dozen other dogs faced into the East on an unknown trail to achieve where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed
BTS He swung the club smartly stopping the rush midway and smashing White Fang down upon the ground
BTS The near bank was a yard away
BTS she asked
BTS I left Maud to pull on it while I went below
BTS As the sun was to the outside dweller this wall was to him the sun of his world
BTS For look you when I place a big contract the terms of which favor me a goodly profit the freight rate from my quarry to market is promptly raised
BTS Sierra Vista awoke in alarm
BTS The man was badly frightened
BTS There was a great snarling and growling and over all arose a smashing and crashing of furniture and glass
BTS She could get meat and she never failed to bring him his share
BTS CHAPTER XVIII The next day while the storm was blowing itself out Wolf Larsen and I crammed anatomy and surgery and set Mugridge's ribs
BTS The situation was desperate
BTS After that he mourned gently when the gods were around
BTS But he was lost as completely as if the earth had swallowed him up and to this day no clew to his end has been discovered
BTS A dog taken off its guard its shoulder slashed open or its ear ripped in ribbons before it knew what was happening was a dog half whipped
BTS Hammerfield paused and cleared his throat--something that cannot be defined comprehensively except to such minds and temperaments as are philosophical
BTS At the fort Beauty Smith left him securely tied and went in to bed
BTS He saw the law operating around him on every side
BTS less proud
BTS But the Cockney was unabashed though mad stark mad
BTS Well well he made a mistake didn't he
BTS CHAPTER II I seemed swinging in a mighty rhythm through orbit vastness
BTS It was from them that the great bellowing went up
BTS I was abnormal an emotionless monster a strange bookish creature capable of pleasuring in sensations only of the mind
BTS And how do you propose to avoid producing a surplus
BTS They as a class believed that they alone maintained civilization
BTS My mistake was in ever opening the books
BTS Or had they been sleeping
BTS He only charges three dollars for this room
BTS On a given day all the farmers in a locality would assemble and sweep across the country in converging lines driving the rabbits by scores of thousands into a prepared enclosure where they were clubbed to death by men and boys
BTS Why shouldn't it
BTS And when I came down amongst the poor I found those who had been robbed and who were hungry and wretched because they had been robbed
BTS The dust of the road arose in a cloud and screened the battle
BTS Again he commanded White Fang to go home
BTS The next moment he had released me and we were gazing at the Macedonia's lights
BTS She made another leap and another
BTS And when he had overthrown the strange dog the gang went in to finish it
BTS Why Judge Caldwell and Colonel Ingram belong to the same lodge and the same club
BTS He sniffed the bodies curiously
BTS Nothing remained to him but his thirst a prodigious possession in itself that grew more prodigious with every sober breath he drew
BTS Often at night we rode over the mountains for exercise and we rode on Wickson's horses
BTS I started to go and Galvin wrung my hand
BTS Look at him Hump Wolf Larsen said to me look at this bit of animated dust this aggregation of matter that moves and breathes and defies me and thoroughly believes itself to be compounded of something good
BTS They have a parboiled appearance are afflicted with hang-nails while the nails are broken and discoloured and the edges of the quick seem to be assuming a fungoid sort of growth
BTS We worked feverishly at carrying our plunder on deck and depositing it amidships so feverishly that Maud whose strength was hardly a positive quantity had to give over exhausted and sit on the steps at the break of the poop
BTS Matt might talk gently to him or swear at him it was all the same
BTS Not alone was it aimed against Jackson
BTS Large or small the railroad always gets my profits
BTS I was learning fast but I learned not fast enough to realize then the peril of our position
BTS In Chicago while on a visit to the United States he was asked by a newspaper reporter for his opinion of that city
BTS But as he lay there suddenly there came to him a feeling as of something terrible impending
BTS Of course this was unconstitutional and of course the United States put its soldiers into the field
BTS Cherokee was puzzled too
BTS And thus he learned that there was no taboo on jackrabbits
BTS The oncoming Harrison caught the kick squarely in the pit of the stomach groaned involuntarily and doubled up and sank backward to the deck
BTS I'm not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he's around Pete announced conclusively nodding his head toward Buck
BTS You are no longer the biggest bit of the ferment
BTS How did you guess
BTS And since you've had a night's start you shall teach me what you have learned
BTS So White Fang hung around the landing with the disreputable gang of Indian dogs waiting for steamers
BTS Never was there so fine a display of the solidarity and the power of labor
BTS A strange a terribly strange region was unrolling itself before my eyes
BTS Because he is the devil as I told you before was Leach's answer
BTS It seemed to me that I was realizing for the first time what a delicate fragile creature a woman is
BTS There is only so much water so much earth so much air
BTS His progress was a series of yelps from which might have been adduced the number of rocks he encountered
BTS The backers of Cherokee waxed jubilant and offered ridiculous odds
BTS As if in answer a great screaming roar went up dim with distance punctuated with detonation after detonation
BTS The crowd was watching curiously
BTS Harrison stood listlessly at the wheel half supporting himself by it as though wearied by the weight of his flesh
BTS But to return
BTS It was vain to think of One Ear so outdistancing his pursuers as to be able to cut across their circle in advance of them and to regain the sled
BTS He betrayed his apprehension and started tentatively to go
BTS Next I pried the primer or cap from the shell and laid it on the rock in the midst of the scattered powder
BTS It marked further the decay or going to pieces of his moral nature a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for existence
BTS Unlike Skeet who was wont to shove her nose under Thornton's hand and nudge and nudge till petted or Nig who would stalk up and rest his great head on Thornton's knee Buck was content to adore at a distance
BTS Where's that boy
BTS There was not one who was not wounded in four or five places while some were wounded grievously
BTS And still I was proud of her because of it
BTS By it he had been formed and hardened into the Fighting Wolf fierce and implacable unloving and unlovable
BTS And furthermore such was the strangeness of it White Fang experienced an unaccountable sensation of pleasure as the hand rubbed back and forth
BTS He gave no reason but his motive was obvious enough
BTS And what you have won is mine sir I said boldly
BTS But it was only for the moment
BTS They follow my track by the clouds above O'er the fathomless tropic blue
BTS There was a great uproar
BTS The naked earth which so shortly before had been so populous
BTS Weak and reeling I went out through the broken window and down the street seeking to escape instinctively and gropingly from the awful shambles
BTS But I have run away from my narrative
BTS Takes more'n a handful of them pesky critters to do for yours truly Bill my son
BTS Ernest's chance for election grew stronger and stronger
BTS It was for you and you should have seen the need of a window
BTS Out of others
BTS Three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour making a total of nine and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Canon
BTS And so with the Oligarchy
BTS and the next moment cap in hand he was saying I beg your pardon
BTS Jones the head of the ethical department in the University of California
BTS I had heard of such things being made of paper and hollow rushes which quickly became saturated and lost all buoyancy
BTS The envy is an intellectual product
BTS It was his privilege to resent it with his teeth
BTS Bosh
BTS Call it the shadow of an oligarchy if you will
BTS He swallowed again and cleared his throat
BTS You see labor has nothing concrete of which to be despoiled
BTS With the dogs falling Mercedes weeping and riding Hal swearing innocuously and Charles's eyes wistfully watering they staggered into John Thornton's camp at the mouth of White River
BTS CHAPTER VII At last after three days of variable winds we have caught the north-east trades
BTS I know only that I am capable of doing anything these days
BTS The very thing I mean
BTS but in the Northland under the law of club and fang whoso took such things into account was a fool and in so far as he observed them he would fail to prosper
BTS He had learned control and poise and he knew the law
BTS And you wouldn't have it
BTS The Oligarchy wanted violence and it set its agents-provocateurs to work
BTS Did I not know that in his profession personal feelings did not count
BTS But they did not stop at one or two
BTS And so I say to the rich among you and to all the rich that bitterly you oppress the Master's lambs
BTS In the meantime the fire remained unbuilt the camp half pitched and the dogs unfed
BTS His tremendous virility and mental strength wall him apart
BTS White Fang flattened his ears ingratiatingly but remained where he was making no attempt to approach
BTS White Fang fought willingly enough but he was outclassed
BTS I profited by my lesson learned through raising the shears and then climbing them to attach the guys
BTS And England at the sacrifice of her great colonies had succeeded only in retaining India
BTS How can I prove it
BTS Prior to that death to me had been a theory
BTS That is you and I will live aboard friendly or not with Wolf Larsen
BTS From somewhere far to the south the dull sound of an explosion came to our ears
BTS The reinvestments of income were adding their mite of many annual millions
BTS Do you know what happens to men who say what you've said about my slop-chest and me
BTS You are all squealing
BTS He was evidently for all of his youth and inexperience cock of the forecastle
BTS Great
BTS Yet his time came in the end in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck could not understand
BTS We worshipped at the shrine of the Revolution which was the shrine of liberty
BTS Before he had hunted in play for the sheer joyousness of it
BTS Mr
BTS I wonder I wonder I repeated pacing up and down
BTS Are they sacred things
BTS The men addressed each other as Hal and Charles
BTS Midway in the passage the current picked up the cub and swept him downstream
BTS He opened his eyes and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnapped king
BTS Dead men's hands have kept it soft
BTS And ever we were flung off farther and farther to the north-east
BTS Why can we not return to ways of our fathers when this republic was founded
BTS How could I put a tangible value upon it
BTS ' Labor's share is called 'wages
BTS No one had remarked my absence
BTS The dog-musher secured a club and went over to the chained animal
BTS Besides there was a greater consistence in their dislike of him
BTS That she was frightened and bewildered and that she was bravely striving to hide it was quite plain to me
BTS It was a vain undertaking
BTS but he missed the railing and his hand with his weight behind it landed squarely on the hot surface
BTS He knew he was at last answering the call running by the side of his wood brother toward the place from where the call surely came
BTS We saw them to-day
BTS He ran him into a blind channel in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way
BTS A nice lot of gazabas you are
BTS To say nothing of three bullet holes clear through him
BTS Good-night Mr
BTS and the two of them raged against each other unceasingly
BTS That tiny men should live and breathe and work and drive so frail a contrivance of wood and cloth through so tremendous an elemental strife
BTS It was in a village at the Great Slave Lake that in the course of resenting the evil of the hands of the man-animals he came to modify the law that he had learned from Grey Beaver namely that the unpardonable crime was to bite one of the gods
BTS but death the ceasing to be able to be vain and vexed he found an eviler thing
BTS ' 'Bother that
BTS Ay ay sir the helmsman responded putting a couple of spokes down
BTS And there was so much yet to be done the sails for instance which practically had to be made over
BTS Behind law must be force to execute the law
BTS It was a big bull they first found
BTS He bristled with facts
BTS Without volition I leaned toward her as a tree is swayed by the wind
BTS We shall land on that island and we shall be snug and sheltered before the day is done
BTS Oh as a revolutionist I have about eight chances to the workingman's one of being injured or killed he answered carelessly
BTS They went on their way but she did not move
BTS I had fallen asleep in that state of nerve tension with which one meets the continuous shock of sound or movement and I had awakened still tense bracing myself to meet the pressure of something which no longer bore upon me
BTS I had steeled myself to brazen it out though I was trembling inwardly
BTS He tried to growl threateningly ferociously
BTS I wanted to cry aloud
BTS They would stop and look at him point him out to one another examine him talk of him and worst of all pat him
BTS The general strike was the one great victory we American socialists won
BTS He was a strange animal an intruder
BTS but I succeeded before nightfall in getting it all spread out on the beach to dry
BTS Ostensibly an oligarch until his death he was in reality one of the most valuable of our agents
BTS Her meaning was forgotten
BTS Yet they never replied in kind never defended themselves against her
BTS Magnificent roads will be built
BTS Dr
BTS To throw one's whole strength and weight on the oars and to feel the boat checked in its forward lunge by the heavy drag behind was not exactly exhilarating
BTS A few minutes of regulating sufficed to put it on its course again when I returned to the preparation of breakfast
BTS To hell with a look-out I heard Wolf Larsen say when we had eaten and drunk our fill
BTS Karl Marx--the great intellectual hero of Socialism
BTS For a time I listened to the clamour in the steerage and marvelled upon the love which had come to me
BTS Our eyes were not loath to meet
BTS Kiche licked White Fang soothingly with her tongue and tried to prevail upon him to remain with her
BTS There were not even cabs on the streets
BTS I challenge you to answer
BTS He was still limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him
BTS It would merely mean that various dangers to us were harmlessly destroying one another
BTS You are afraid of me
BTS That wolf's a dog an' it's eaten fish many's the time from the hand of man
BTS Kobe was a shambles
BTS She had now caught the bosom-breathing of the ocean and was herself a-breath with the rhythm of it as she smoothly mounted and slipped down each broad-backed wave
BTS He seemed to remember it all the white woods and earth and moonlight and the thrill of battle
BTS In the centre of the space it had occupied he sat down
BTS Curly was the victim
BTS It's a wolf and there's no taming it Weedon Scott announced
BTS They were I may say apprenticed to education to art to the church to science to literature
BTS Wolf Larsen was steering his eyes glistening and snapping as they dwelt upon and leaped from detail to detail of the chase
BTS the men pulling and hauling and two of them climbing aloft
BTS A moment later he was straying away again from his mother
BTS When Grey Beaver tied the thong around his neck and passed the end of the thong into Beauty Smith's keeping White Fang knew that it was his god's will for him to go with Beauty Smith
BTS Charles and Hal went out in the evening and bought six Outside dogs
BTS The Bishop's utterance was a violent assault upon the established morality
BTS An adjective descriptive of ruined and dilapidated houses in which great numbers of the working people found shelter in those days
BTS but my action with those women sisters of mine shows me that the better way is easy to find
BTS That's why I kept my hands offen him at the start
BTS But instead Buck's shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly away
BTS I will always pay my dues and when the cooperative commonwealth comes I will be glad
BTS They drank whisky they drank it neat and I fetched more
BTS She poised for a moment then sprang for the dancing rabbit
BTS The other four men glued their eyes on their plates and chewed steadily and with thoughtful precision their ears moving and wobbling in time with their jaws like the ears of so many animals
BTS Possibly he accepted it as one of the restrictions of life
BTS But you competed among yourselves
BTS Congress and the Senate were empty pretences farces
BTS Among them he said he had found keen intellects and brilliant wits ministers of the Gospel who had been broken because their Christianity was too wide for any congregation of mammon-worshippers and professors who had been broken on the wheel of university subservience to the ruling class
BTS Only by the steady regard of his eyes did he express his love and by the unceasing following with his eyes of his god's every movement
BTS Their ribs is like wash-boards an' their stomachs is right up against their backbones
BTS and as I caught her arm to help her down the companion stairs I was startled by its smallness and softness
BTS A few minutes sufficed to finish the loading and I lowered the boat into the water
BTS There was more cursing and a mocking laugh and when all was quiet I stole outside and found a heavy knife imbedded over an inch in the solid wood
BTS The man's soul is his desires
BTS I want to ask you some questions
BTS She no more than started for she swayed and tottered and reached her hand weakly out to mine
BTS And here it was now and I was face to face with it
BTS It is your only hope
BTS Blankets for a hotel quoth one of the men who laughed and helped
BTS He said much more of the same vague sort and I couldn't pin him down to anything specific
BTS It was one o'clock
BTS It was a long cruel chase but he was better nourished than they and in the end outran them
BTS The great German war-lord prepared and so did the United States prepare
BTS This was his one trouble in the running of the pack
BTS Whatever was to be done I must do for myself
BTS The sap was rising in the pines
BTS Thus they slowly diverged toward the west drawing farther away from the remainder of the boats in their line
BTS For a dog to attack another it would have to turn upon one at a shorter rope
BTS further that for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained
BTS Finally he commanded me to resume my seat at the cabin table for a time and let the cook do my work
BTS Buck on the bank worried and anxious kept abreast of the boat his eyes never off his master
BTS Then why move at all since moving is living
BTS If anything's going to run us down we couldn't get out of its way
BTS I'm strongest at noon yet under the moon I stiffen the bunt of her sail
BTS One wolf long and lean and gray advanced cautiously in a friendly manner and Buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night and a day
BTS These are essential traits of the wolf and the wild-dog when they have become domesticated and these traits White Fang possessed in unusual measure
BTS Mercedes screamed
BTS Get outa my galley-doors you bloomin' swabs
BTS There came a time when not only did the meat-supply cease but the milk no longer came from his mother's breast
BTS Wants all he can get--true but deplorable
BTS And she was young--only forty
BTS So fierce had this final struggle become that the sailor paused in the act of flinging more water over him and stared curiously the canvas bucket partly tilted and dripping its contents to the deck
BTS Maud stood silently by my side while I evolved in my mind the contrivance known among sailors as shears
BTS Though a long way from his full growth White Fang next to Lip-lip was the largest yearling in the village
BTS You Mr
BTS He had had no idea that I had left New York and coming through the room where I lay asleep could not at first believe that it was I
BTS A moment later he emerged a heavy-set young fellow of eighteen or nineteen with a glowering villainous countenance trailing at his heels
BTS He took the sea-lamp from its swinging frame and handed it to me
BTS To them this was the one feature of the day though it was good to loaf around after the fish was eaten for an hour or so with the other dogs of which there were fivescore and odd
BTS There were seven puppies in the team
BTS You have never considered moral rights in your dealings with others
BTS Judge Scott shook his head sadly at luncheon table when his son narrated the lesson he had given White Fang
BTS It is just as mysterious to me
BTS Concerning that night's ride the man spoke most eloquently for himself in a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water front
BTS Also they gave advice
BTS Rest be blanked said Hal with his beardless lips
BTS It floated too low and was shot full of holes before it could reach the fortresses
BTS Girls work much faster
BTS All the ghosts of the past arose and were with him
BTS As Mr
BTS His incessant talking and shouting and bellowing of orders had been too much for Wolf Larsen who had accordingly foisted the nuisance upon his hunters
BTS I think I have one coming on now
BTS The New York Court of Special Sessions in 1905 A
BTS Not only did they escape but every one of them won to the refuges as planned
BTS Three a hunter a boat-puller and a boat-steerer compose a boat's crew
BTS Let's watch him and follow him if he hauls out
BTS That was before the Earthquake
BTS The commotion caused the circle of eyes to shift restlessly for a moment and even to withdraw a bit but it settled down again as the dogs became quiet
BTS I've got a sled standing outside now with twenty fiftypound sacks of flour on it Matthewson went on with brutal directness
BTS Both the Bishop and my father were embarrassed and perturbed
BTS and if you are so minded just go ahead and try to clap on the hatch
BTS The socialists used to foretell with joy he said the coming of the day when organized labor defeated on the industrial field would come over on to the political field
BTS CHAPTER V THE PHILOMATHS Ernest was often at the house
BTS All the wastage of meat such as the frozen chips belonged to the dog that found it
BTS I shook my head
BTS You've got spunk as you Yanks s'y an' I like yer in a w'y
BTS He was a ferocious man
BTS Wells was a sociological seer sane and normal as well as warm human
BTS Also he must watch out for the live things
BTS She shook her head and gazed at me pitifully
BTS Hammerfield interrupted
BTS It would seem your function is to twist truth at the command of your employers who in turn obey the behests of the corporations
BTS When he ventured to run abreast of the older wolf which was seldom a snarl and a snap sent him back even with the shoulder again
BTS Gad sir
BTS Bull-pen--in a miners' strike in Idaho in the latter part of the nineteenth century it happened that many of the strikers were confined in a bull-pen by the troops
BTS They ain't a-goin' to get any more of our dogs if I can help it
BTS Be a good dog and all 'll go well and the goose hang high
BTS Near the gang-plank Scott was shaking hands with Matt who was preparing to go ashore
BTS It required much thinking and endless patience on the part of Weedon Scott to accomplish this
BTS I was puzzled by the strangeness of it
BTS Will you protest
BTS Chopping down young saplings he made them cross-bars of a scaffold by lashing them high up to the trunks of standing trees
BTS Yes I have she answered slowly and I could have laughed aloud at his crestfallen visage
BTS He's no fool
BTS And don't forget what I told you about temperature
BTS I had thought to see that day
BTS O the blazing tropic night when the wake's a welt of light That holds the hot sky tame And the steady forefoot snores through the planet-powdered floors Where the scared whale flukes in flame
BTS There was Baseek a grizzled old fellow that in his younger days had but to uncover his fangs to send White Fang cringing and crouching to the right about
BTS I must say though when we walked down to the Ghost to inspect more closely the task before us that the sight of the great masts lying in the water almost disheartened me
BTS The sailors trooped noisily aft some of the watch below rubbing the sleep from their eyes and talked in low tones together
BTS He sprang upon Buck and twice his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone
BTS They drank and drank and ever the bottles slipped forward and they drank more
BTS Fifteen-two fifteen-four an' a pair makes six Mat was pegging up when there was an outcry and sound of snarling without
BTS A twig that he thought a long way off would the next instant hit him on the nose or rake along his ribs
BTS He looked it and the piercing glitter that arose at times in his eyes was the same piercing glitter I had observed in the eyes of caged leopards and other preying creatures of the wild
BTS This memory is as distinct and sharp as that of any picture I have seen
BTS I can hardly move my hand
BTS The breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations with one another
BTS As the track led his way he followed prepared to meet the maker of it at every turn of the stream
BTS Now take a run up with the glasses and raise some of the boats
BTS Illuminating oil was becoming all profit
BTS Very good
BTS Let me go with you I volunteered
BTS but roused he must have been for Smoke had a bruised and discoloured eye and looked particularly vicious when he came into the cabin for supper
BTS His free nature asserted itself and he showed his teeth and snarled fearlessly in the face of the wrathful god
BTS But here are such facts as we do know
BTS Here are our hands
BTS They were adrift four days
BTS He was beginning the ascent
BTS And now we shall have no hot coffee soup tea or anything
BTS and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy by the saw-mill at Dawson they understood Buck and his ways and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with Skeet and Nig
BTS You are the champion of this whole audience
BTS He it was that came up on the poop without orders and dragged Johnson forward where he set about dressing his wounds as well as he could and making him comfortable
BTS When he moved it moved and he growled at it through his clenched jaws
BTS In time the unknown as a thing of terror and menace ever impending faded away
BTS It cannot be Alaska
BTS It was bitter bloody work but we were fighting for life and for the Revolution and we had to fight the enemy with its own weapons
BTS Mr
BTS Wait till we take office in the spring we answered
BTS The days passed by and they kept together hunting their meat and killing and eating it in common
BTS It never entered his head
BTS He laughed one of his horrible mocking laughs
BTS The Martinez was sinking fast for the water was very near
BTS And his cadences were their cadences the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness and the cold and dark
BTS And so a decision was laughingly reached
BTS To antithesis was due his naming
BTS But Maud said Tut tut in gentle reproval and then asked why I was a blithering idiot
BTS And those who do know whisper that the hunters while excellent shots were so notorious for their quarrelsome and rascally proclivities that they could not sign on any decent schooner
BTS All hands were asleep
BTS A stranger could not hear this note and to such a stranger the growling of White Fang was an exhibition of primordial savagery nerve-racking and blood-curdling
BTS I don't think it was worth it I said to Wolf Larsen a broken boat for Kelly's life
BTS Harrison and Kelly however made such an attempt
BTS Wages are going to be advanced and hours shortened in the railroad unions the iron and steel workers unions and the engineer and machinist unions
BTS The Canadian and Mexican patriots who were far stronger than the Iron Heel dreamed were to duplicate our tactics
BTS Paper and ink she laughed
BTS And a blubber-eating fur-clad god can exist and work--in the mind
BTS It tried to retreat before him
BTS It is the wind that fans the desire until it leaps up to mastery
BTS Everhard unpalatable though it has been
BTS Haw
BTS I testified to the effect that Jackson injured himself by neglect and carelessness and that the company was not in any way to blame or liable
BTS But I'll stand my watch on board hereafter I blurted out a moment later
BTS One kiss more before they come
BTS He became my oracle
BTS so each morning early she slipped down and let him out before the family was awake
BTS Yet never did it ring more loudly than that night as I watched her draw back the blanket of moss from the coals blow up the fire and cook the evening meal
BTS He stepped boldly out on it
BTS And this was Buck's pride too
BTS How did you get wet
BTS I saw seven
BTS Both are apologists for the Oligarchy
BTS But in the end the condemned man found his executioner in the form of a slender girl of seventeen Madeline Provence who to accomplish her purpose served two years in his palace as a seamstress to the household
BTS The surgeon smiled indulgently
BTS Through the trees the mouth of the alley could be seen opening out on a moonlit glade
BTS The love of man and woman I had always held was a sublimated something related to spirit a spiritual bond that linked and drew their souls together
BTS and as the days went by they continued to come up the river stop and then go on up the river out of sight
BTS I quavered
BTS The boat's stern touched the hard shingle
BTS The farmers were in the net
BTS The snarling of his dogs was losing its efficacy
BTS It was as successful as it was selfish and out of it was coined the word arthurization to denote grab-sharing on the part of labor unions
BTS One night he sprang from sleep with a start eager-eyed nostrils quivering and scenting his mane bristling in recurrent waves
BTS But my father died and I came to work in the mills
BTS They developed a staff of investment seekers and investigators
BTS The war should be called off or the general strike would continue
BTS It is like yeast a ferment a thing that moves and may move for a minute an hour a year or a hundred years but that in the end will cease to move
BTS Something's gone wrong with my brain
BTS I had forgotten to make provision for a flag-halyard
BTS Great armies of them are toiling now at the building of Ardis housed in wretched barracks where family life cannot exist and where decency is displaced by dull bestiality
BTS Wolf Larsen had little to say at first doing no more than reply when he was addressed
BTS And yet there was a certain ascetic lengthening of the lines of his face
BTS My mission had been to testify to his identity and loyalty
BTS For he steals my bread and meat and bed and in so doing imperils my life
BTS This man talked with Manuel and money chinked between them
BTS No I answered but we are approaching it at a rate of six miles an hour
BTS As I started toward the weather side I saw him make a sudden motion with his head which I mistook for a token of recognition and good-morning
BTS Wot I say
BTS It was like the grip of death
BTS A boy's cap was perched on her head and her hair light brown and arranged in a loose and fluffy order that caught the sun seemed an aureole about the delicate oval of her face
BTS Asmunsen the owner of a large granite quarry in Contra Costa County
BTS Weedon Scott looked across at his companion with eyes that almost pleaded though this was given the lie by his words
BTS Collie clasped in the arms of one of the women watched him jealously and with a snarl warned him that all was not well
BTS You are better educated than most workingmen I said
BTS It would never do
BTS If I speak not fast it is because I have not been from the old country as long as you
BTS About his body there was a peculiar springiness or resiliency almost catlike and a quick alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of things seen and unseen
BTS They closed in upon her snarling and yelping and she was buried screaming with agony beneath the bristling mass of bodies
BTS They are made to carry the weak the sick and the aged
BTS God is noddin' and not doin' his duty though it's me as shouldn't say it
BTS Burton struck out without warning straight from the shoulder
BTS At once began to rise the cries that were fiercely sad cries that called through the darkness and cold to one another and answered back
BTS He could not help it
BTS He did not stir as I passed by him and went down into the cabin
BTS Then the she-wolf sat down pointed her nose at a star and began to howl
BTS It is on record that Theodore Roosevelt at that time President of the United States said in 1905 A
BTS There were no more animals with which to fight at least there was none considered worthy of fighting with him
BTS But he knew further that the comfort of the fire would be his the protection of the gods the companionship of the dogs the last a companionship of enmity but none the less a companionship and satisfying to his gregarious needs
BTS Being in no haste Indian fashion he hunted his dinner in the course of the day's travel
BTS He achieved a staidness and calmness and philosophic tolerance
BTS The members of the favored unions became the aristocracy of labor
BTS The blot of smoke which indicated the Macedonia's position had reappeared
BTS Nothing daunted him
BTS What was I to do
BTS He's a wolf
BTS For it is my world my gorgeous world The world of my dear delight From the brightest gleam of the Arctic stream To the dusk of my own love-night
BTS From the point the shore curved away more and more to the south and west until at last it disclosed a cove within the cove a little land-locked harbour the water level as a pond broken only by tiny ripples where vagrant breaths and wisps of the storm hurtled down from over the frowning wall of rock that backed the beach a hundred feet inshore
BTS But to return to Peter Donnelly and his son
BTS Only I disagree with you about the doom of the middle class
BTS She has lived with the wolves said a third Indian
BTS Look at the fish and their millions of eggs
BTS He plucked nervously at his sleeve as we talked
BTS I might be able to help you a  her voice broke a little
BTS Head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth
BTS His iron-like body ignored fatigue
BTS Police were running for the spot
BTS Whither was I drifting
BTS There was a strong smell of pine and subtle wood fragrances filled the air reminding him of his old life of freedom before the days of his bondage
BTS And now for the next step
BTS These added to the six of the original team and Teek and Koona the huskies obtained at the Rink Rapids on the record trip brought the team up to fourteen
BTS He had learned some more about the world
BTS When morning came and a dim light pervaded the lair he again sought after the source of the remotely familiar sounds
BTS That night a German fleet made a dash on Honolulu sinking three American cruisers and a revenue cutter and bombarding the city
BTS Heem keel dat Spitz heem t'ink to take de job
BTS and she worked only thirty years
BTS Will-making and will-breaking became complementary trades like armor-making and gun-making
BTS Dave was fair and very wise
BTS If nothing else I was escaping from the organized ostracism that had been our increasing portion in the university town ever since the enmity of the nascent Oligarchy had been incurred
BTS He was firmly planted on his legs
BTS The Rev
BTS Hammerfield he was unused to this fierce infighting as Ernest called it
BTS he cried
BTS A panic seized all of them and they scattered in every direction running in blind terror the wounded officer roughly dropped being left behind
BTS Heem worth one t'ousan' dollair by Gar
BTS I saw the levelled revolver hesitate then sink down and heard the disgusted grunt of the policeman
BTS One day not long after he came to the edge of the forest where a narrow stretch of open land sloped down to the Mackenzie
BTS Twice we have passed a national income tax and each time the supreme court smashed it as unconstitutional
BTS The will to exist of his body surged over him
BTS The cat-like springiness in his tread was a little more pronounced than usual and his eyes were bright and snappy
BTS He made no attempt to come ashore
BTS He was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow
BTS Everything was happening quickly
BTS Chicago was the ripest of all--Chicago which of old time was the city of blood and which was to earn anew its name
BTS She had stepped out beside me and I regarded her with wonderment
BTS Man is so made these days that his capacity for living is determined by the money he possesses
BTS In places the stone facing of the building was torn away exposing the iron construction beneath
BTS Matt took hold of White Fang ready to pull when Cherokee's jaws should be loosened
BTS Only Spencer and myself know how hard I hammered
BTS CHAPTER XVIII IN THE SHADOW OF SONOMA Of myself during this period there is not much to say
BTS Look at 'm wag his tail
BTS He treated me vilely cursed me continually and heaped his own work upon me
BTS Man and the claims of man no longer bound him
BTS And such a piece of meat was of value
BTS Again Maud rectified the twist with the watch-tackle and again she lowered away from the windlass
BTS It would flutter and live till the last line of communication was broken and after that who was to say how much longer it might continue to flutter and live
BTS They remembered only the latest which was his weakness and sickness
BTS but in reality it took away from him all honour and instead of being bully and master of the pack he now found himself hated and persecuted by the pack
BTS He was executed by the Iron Heel in 1928 A
BTS She was very tired
BTS Why my dear sirs you are as remote from the intellectual life of the twentieth century as an Indian medicine-man making incantation in the primeval forest ten thousand years ago
BTS No she announced
BTS In his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls and they had retaliated by teasing him
BTS It is our strength
BTS The sled itself was without runners being a birch-bark toboggan with upturned forward end to keep it from ploughing under the snow
BTS All markets were glutted
BTS The she-wolf sat down in the snow and old One Eye now more in fear of his mate than of the mysterious sapling again sprang for the rabbit
BTS It must have occurred before he received the knife-thrust which made only a superficial wound
BTS 'Tis no egg-shell'll float on this sea an hour come an' it's a stroke iv luck for them we're here to pick 'em up
BTS But he did not go into the fires
BTS Matt demanded
BTS We are not brutal and savage
BTS It fluttered and tightened again
BTS But how did you lose the masts
BTS They gave a multitude of excuses but not one house would consider the book
BTS Henry thought long over it before he went to sleep and as his eyelids fluttered down and he dozed off the thought in his mind was There's no mistakin' it Bill's almighty blue
BTS Between us we picked them up and replaced them in the broken bag which he now held carefully in the hollow of his arm
BTS I grasped that I was in danger but that was all
BTS They were crazed by the smell of the food
BTS Temptation plays no part unless  he paused while grasping the new thought which had come into his mind unless he is tempted to remain sober
BTS The police and the automobile patrols went by and once half a dozen fire-engines returning evidently from some conflagration
BTS The Cockney's body left the water
BTS This had been Maud's idea and she had herself jealously gathered all the moss
BTS Robert Hunter in 1906 in a book entitled Poverty pointed out that at that time there were ten millions in the United States living in poverty
BTS I was disappointed shocked
BTS My memory flashed back to that first thin little volume on my desk and I saw before me as though in the concrete the row of thin little volumes on my library shelf
BTS With a nervous shrinking paw One Eye stretched out the porcupine to its full length and turned it over on its back
BTS A cancer a tumour or something of that nature a thing that devours and destroys
BTS Joe had lost an eye
BTS He paused beside Scott and touched him on the shoulder saying ominously Don't break them teeth stranger
BTS and when the strike-breakers were worsted by the labor unions the troops always appeared and crushed the unions
BTS ' sez I
BTS The whole setting was wild and for the first time regarding this strange woman and realizing how incongruous she was in it I was aware of how much a part of it I was myself
BTS I know it was his answer
BTS I was wild with desire like a child with a new toy to hoist something with my shears
BTS the marvel of it
BTS From time to time it rocked back and forward as with pain
BTS CHAPTER XXVII Day broke grey and chill
BTS Hump runs the galley from now on and Cooky pulls in his horns
BTS If it is a good soul it will desire and do the good action and the contrary if it is a bad soul
BTS From his book entitled The Battles of Labor is quoted the declaration that in some of the great historic strikes the employers themselves have instigated acts of violence
BTS This book Economics and Education was published in that year
BTS Let me tell you
BTS The wolves were now more open in their pursuit trotting sedately behind and ranging along on either side their red tongues lolling out their lean sides showing the undulating ribs with every movement
BTS Ernest was upon him like a flash
BTS A little less than a hundred years ago and a little more than six hundred years after the death the confession of Pervaise was discovered in the secret archives of the Vatican
BTS The editors were afraid of him and the publishers would have none of him
BTS And thereafter in the orgy of horror that raged through the succeeding hours I was able to take a calm interest
BTS When he saw White Fang's eyes beginning to glaze he knew beyond doubt that the fight was lost
BTS Hunting their living meat as the Yeehats were hunting it on the flanks of the migrating moose the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the land of streams and timber and invaded Buck's valley
BTS I don't feel right somehow
BTS Maud and I went about our work oppressed by the fearful fate which had overtaken him how fearful we were yet fully to realize
BTS On other days they were unable to get started at all
BTS She let out a shrill shriek and bore in upon us
BTS You have seen that you were beaten soundly at your old tactics of strike and boycott Ernest urged
BTS Mr
BTS Not to be tiresome I shall say that I fetched the book from his state-room and read Caliban aloud
BTS The reflection from the sky of vast conflagrations made the street almost as light as day
BTS But when mother died his own work could not fill the emptiness
BTS What of the Macedonia
BTS There was something repulsive about his touch
BTS now
BTS After it has paid its expenses does it consume the remainder
BTS Dr
BTS The immediate fighting had ceased and I was watching the balloon attack on the fortresses
BTS But I complained no more and set about making a tent of the sail for Maud
BTS For the first time in many days I breathed freely
BTS There was no common speech by which he might learn what he wanted to know
BTS He was not afraid but merely lazy
BTS And I make free to say that for the time being life assumed the same sordid values to me
BTS He did not like the man
BTS And during that week of silence the Oligarchy was taught its lesson
BTS He must have leaped also at the same instant straight down on Wolf Larsen
BTS They were unable to move the sled
BTS Hammerfield and Dr
BTS Tell me
BTS Wants to know what has become of you and I don't know how to tell him
BTS Come on back you pore little mamma's darling
BTS He had a strong sense of justice and he soon became fired with a passion to redress wrong
BTS There were two kinds of life his own kind and the other kind
BTS To my delight she never once looked toward the beach and I maintained the banter with such success all unconsciously she sipped coffee from the china cup ate fried evaporated potatoes and spread marmalade on her biscuit
BTS Scott opened his arms to her but kept his eyes on White Fang
BTS A spasm of fear went through him
BTS He's beyond me
BTS Half a dozen men were about the man who crouched in the centre of the dying fire
BTS But is the opposite true
BTS In passion to rend and destroy he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy
BTS There was nothing to do nothing to see nor hear
BTS But don't you
BTS the fellows at the University Club and the Bibelot shaking their heads and saying Poor chap
BTS Ernest queried mockingly
BTS I don't know whether I'll ever see you again
BTS But somebody had to do the cooking and whatever else his shortcomings Beauty Smith could cook
BTS And then when he shook hands with me
BTS I want to tell you again Hump he said threateningly that you'd better leave things alone
BTS Mugridge sir he fawned his effeminate features running into a greasy smile
BTS The onlookers laughed uproariously and he felt ashamed he knew not why for it was his first snow
BTS As an enemy of his kind it was in White Fang's province to fight with them
BTS That's because you're not a fool I suppose said Hal
BTS CHAPTER III THE HUNGER CRY The day began auspiciously
BTS Young Wickson never wavered in his loyalty to the Cause
BTS He was knocked off his feet
BTS He looked at me curiously
BTS In addition he was immensely wealthy
BTS It is true that you have read history aright
BTS And how far have we to go
BTS The hut's walls rose without difficulty and everything went smoothly until the problem of the roof confronted me
BTS My memory of riding in the automobile is very hazy though this ride in turn is broken by one vivid picture
BTS Again he yielded to the tying of a thong around his neck by Grey Beaver and again Beauty Smith came to claim him
BTS Jerk open the doors Hump I was commanded
BTS I could not follow his reasoning but I was soon to learn it
BTS PART V CHAPTER I THE LONG TRAIL It was in the air
BTS Why you spoke of sending the militia to the Philippines
BTS Hartman was jubilant
BTS And as they continued to fall upon him the spark of life within flickered and went down
BTS And on the porch before the delighted family Judge Scott face to face with White Fang said slowly and solemnly sixteen times White Fang you are smarter than I thought
BTS Each night the dogs were attended to first
BTS And then shame came to him
BTS You know today without my telling you that the Railroad Trust owns or controls the entire anthracite and bituminous coal fields
BTS Oh I don't know about that Matt objected
BTS And besides young man I must tell you that you have said nothing new
BTS He was ever a graceful man diplomatic tactful and considerate
BTS What shall I do then
BTS White Fang learned rapidly the ways of the camp
BTS A yawning hole was all that was to be seen
BTS Grey Beaver again made him fast with a thong and in the morning turned him over to Beauty Smith
BTS It bound his movements restricted his freedom
BTS D'ye hear that
BTS He now became the enemy of all things and more ferocious than ever
BTS I knew you were here all the time
BTS It came to me quite as a matter of course that this was Ernest and I found myself wondering how he had got his hair and eyebrows so badly singed
BTS Judge Scott surveyed them triumphantly
BTS Like Dr
BTS You were unfortunate in having your life cast in easy places but you're developing and I like you the better for it
BTS They blocked their own efforts while Wolf Larsen with but a single purpose achieved his
BTS I was exhausted and could go no farther
BTS ' And in the time to come when you rise in your strength remember that you will be rising against the property of the trusts and the liberty of the trusts according to the law to squeeze you
BTS It was unreal
BTS He ignored her existence whenever it was possible and made it a point to keep out of her way
BTS The seven great trusts working together had pooled their enormous surpluses and made a farm trust
BTS He broke into the long easy lope and went on hour after hour never at loss for the tangled way heading straight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that put man and his magnetic needle to shame
BTS Just about all in he announced
BTS In the end there remained only four the she-wolf the young leader the one-eyed one and the ambitious three-year-old
BTS One broken hind-leg he went on
BTS White Fang had now achieved a reputation in the land
BTS The end of each movement was the accent of the rhythm the movement ending abruptly and the growling rising with a jerk
BTS For him to attack her would require nothing less than a violation of his instinct
BTS He did not know any other place much less of a way to get there
BTS Industries were working short time
BTS Two hundred thousand machinists along with their five hundred thousand allies in the metalworking trades had been defeated in as bloody a strike as had ever marred the United States
BTS But the clubbing
BTS But have you thought upon what would immediately happen
BTS If all that I fear be so your private income your principal itself can be taken from you just as easily as your salary
BTS The Ghost swung around into the wind and I finished my work forward in time to run aft and lend a hand with the mainsheet
BTS I sprang jubilantly to my feet
BTS The two men looked at each other
BTS Mr
BTS And petty and selfish
BTS Suddenly he saw a strange thing like mist beginning to arise from the sticks and moss beneath Grey Beaver's hands
BTS Spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown slashing Buck down the shoulder and leaping clear
BTS And by that same method of reasoning the inductive method philosophy fuses all particular sciences into one great science
BTS In fact nothing no matter how remotely eatable had escaped them
BTS Every rope was brought to a ring at the front end of the sled
BTS The oligarchs themselves were compelled to listen to the decrees of the Groups and often when they disobeyed were punished by death--and likewise with the subordinates of the oligarchs with the officers of the army and the leaders of the labor castes
BTS His height was probably five feet ten inches or ten and a half
BTS It clinched his argument he contended
BTS You make me all-fired tired
BTS I queried
BTS I felt endowed with a sudden strength
BTS You doubt your immortality eh
BTS You lacked perspective
BTS And there were easements and satisfactions
BTS All day long he limped in agony and camp once made lay down like a dead dog
BTS I asked pausing for the moment on the threshold
BTS I said don't break them teeth the faro-dealer repeated more ominously than before
BTS He could feel a new stir in the land
BTS You have slept in soft beds and worn fine clothes and eaten good meals
BTS At first he did not know where he was
BTS The birds talked of it the squirrels chattered about it the very breeze whispered of it
BTS Heads nodded in acquiescence
BTS We've only got six dogs Henry said
BTS Off the Farallones heading about sou-west he answered slowly and methodically as though groping for his best English and rigidly observing the order of my queries
BTS I asked
BTS Wolf Larsen motioned for me to come down and when I stood beside him at the wheel gave me instructions for heaving to
BTS But I warn you now and not so much for your own good as for mine that I shall shoot you the moment you attempt a hostile act
BTS yet he retained his wildness and wiliness
BTS But it was not till the third day that we found them all of them the shears included and of all perilous places in the pounding surf of the grim south-western promontory
BTS Ernest asked --unselfish and godlike and so few in numbers as to be practically non-existent or are you discussing the common and ordinary average man
BTS she asked detecting the anxious glance I had shot at the object of our conversation and impressed I flatter myself with the earnestness of my manner
BTS Yes he answered in a low strong voice and worse than that
BTS he had idle time in which to devote himself to thoughts of trickery
BTS I hated him then and consoled myself with the thought that his behavior was what was to be expected from a man of the working class
BTS In a flash Buck knew it
BTS In four months possibly three if the season closes early Wolf Larsen said
BTS The next moment the front of the column went by
BTS As for Wolf Larsen and myself we got along fairly well
BTS In the lower bunk lay Louis grossly fat and warm and sweaty asleep unfeignedly and sleeping laboriously
BTS so was this governor and this supreme court judge
BTS We have not the strength with which to fight this man
BTS I had slept late and I stepped outside with sudden energy bent upon making up lost time as befitted a dweller on Endeavour Island
BTS He sprang away from it and from a distance studied it suspiciously
BTS CHAPTER XI THE GREAT ADVENTURE Mr
BTS It's a lie
BTS As for myself I turned deathly sick
BTS came the hail from on deck and his face brightened
BTS This portion was composed of the non-killers and the small killers
BTS But as I studied the surf which beat upon the beach I said Still bad but not so bad
BTS And I thought I had that much left in me
BTS Grey Beaver was offering him one piece of the tallow
BTS Whereupon he leaned his head on his hands and wept
BTS It got half of it he announced
BTS It was this which had given poise and penetration to her own work and made her of worth to the world
BTS Yet you expect to sit at an editor's desk some day and conduct a policy
BTS The fingers spread slightly falling apart of their own weight and the pencil rolled away
BTS but the sailors took pains to put me to rights Louis proving an especially good teacher and I had little trouble with those under me
BTS Thus will the strong men who might else be revolutionists be won away and their strength used to bolster the Oligarchy
BTS And where am I
BTS Slowly cautiously it was unrolling its ball of impregnable armour
BTS Of course it would trade abroad certain things it produced for things it did not produce
BTS The left hand stumbled slowly and painfully across the paper and it was with extreme difficulty that we deciphered the scrawl
BTS There are the jute mills you know and the same thing goes on there
BTS All that they saw of him was his bushy tail and fleeing hind legs a view far less ferocious and intimidating than his bristling mane and gleaming fangs
BTS The dog-musher wore a moustache but the other a taller and younger man was smooth-shaven his skin rosy from the pounding of his blood and the running in the frosty air
BTS It's just so much slush and sentiment and you must see it yourself at least for one who does not believe in eternal life
BTS He shook his head
BTS I was unfortunately and ignorantly facing it
BTS Matt had dashed into the cabin and come out with a rifle
BTS Need I
BTS Tundra grass was impracticable
BTS For a lawyer you are the hardest man to keep to a point I ever saw Ernest began his answer to the tirade
BTS The lash bit into him again and again but he neither whined nor struggled
BTS Asmunsen's answer with the cries of all the men at the table behind him
BTS But the dog younger or smaller than himself was weak a thing to be destroyed
BTS The other nodded and asked How about the back
BTS And through the air he is rushing on to his Gethsemane
BTS Nor could I attack such a creature who had but to twist my arm to break it
BTS One foot also he held up after the manner of a dog
BTS He was wise and yet in the nature of him there were forces greater than wisdom
BTS There is another way out
BTS She too had noticed the power of the repeated please
BTS I know that the Church has lost the--what you call the proletariat
BTS My hold had been broken loose I was under water and the thought passed through my mind that this was the terrible thing of which I had heard the being swept in the trough of the sea
BTS They met by chance on the ferry-boat to San Francisco so that the warning he gave father was not premeditated
BTS The two men were bent over the sled and trying to right it when Henry observed One Ear sidling away
BTS A pack of bloodhounds followed the way of his bleeding feet
BTS Who is weak and fallible prone to error
BTS A sailor stepped forward obediently
BTS Buck laughed as dogs laugh yet kept his distance
BTS Quite right quite right
BTS We have not forgotten the deeds of our forefathers
BTS His muscles had wasted away to knotty strings and the flesh pads had disappeared so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness
BTS But he could well stand it for it seemed to add a certain nobility of refinement to the riotous excess of life that had always marked his features
BTS But Buck turned about and started slowly on the back track
BTS And the more I thought about it the more it appeared that my duty to myself lay in doing what he had advised lay in joining forces with Johnson and Leach and working for his death
BTS Powerfully muscled though some of them were there had been something wrong with all of them an insufficient development here an undue development there a twist or a crook that destroyed symmetry legs too short or too long or too much sinew or bone exposed or too little
BTS Scott snapped out
BTS He had committed what was to him sacrilege sunk his fangs into the holy flesh of a god and of a white-skinned superior god at that
BTS Throughout the day and as slowly and steadily as ever the wind increased
BTS she cried
BTS Did he
BTS You have the chance always he sneered
BTS My bedroom at home was not large yet it could have contained a dozen similar forecastles and taking into consideration the height of the ceiling a score at least
BTS in 1904 435040
BTS Not so simple a task for one man
BTS And so fresh from the soft southern world these dogs trotting down the gang-plank and out upon the Yukon shore had but to see White Fang to experience the irresistible impulse to rush upon him and destroy him
BTS I have demonstrated to you mathematically the inevitable breakdown of the capitalist system
BTS But he is too sure too sure
BTS Embittered by his fate brooding over his wrongs he became an anarchist--not a philosophic anarchist but a mere animal mad with hate and lust for revenge
BTS The moment was dramatic
BTS Let us first of all investigate a particular industrial process and whenever I state something with which you disagree please interrupt me
BTS and in the bitter hatred between him and Spitz he betrayed no impatience shunned all offensive acts
BTS I had already remarked that his language was excellent marred with an occasional slight inaccuracy
BTS But the Mercenaries were not content with what they had done
BTS But watch your footing
BTS Yes and I've had warnings of this for the last three days
BTS Inside this circle he crouched his sleeping outfit under him as a protection against the melting snow
BTS Then the muscles relaxed the head stopped rolling and a sigh as of profound relief floated upward from his lips
BTS Not quite entirely had the porcupine unrolled when it discovered its enemy
BTS But we'll make sailors out of them or boat-pullers at any rate
BTS and he that sweareth as he that feareth an oath
BTS I watched fascinated
BTS and as he grew older he felt this power in the sharper admonishment of her paw
BTS They were half-brothers only they did not know it
BTS Undreamed of
BTS And she clapped her hands and declared that she was hugely pleased
BTS I had folded up the blankets but she now proceeded to spread them out on the bottom
BTS Then labor has received in wages during the same period two billion dollars
BTS Bah
BTS Colonel Ingram had ingloriously bolted overturning a palm in his flight
BTS And even there they were frustrated for stringent vagrancy laws were passed and rigidly enforced
BTS CHAPTER XXII I knew what it was as she came toward me
BTS Out of fear for the welfare of their families men devised the scheme of insurance
BTS There was Owen of Silverberg Owen  Company--a large grocery firm with several branch stores
BTS The jaws stopped working the ears ceased wobbling and though eyes remained glued on plates each man listened greedily for the answer
BTS The small manufacturers and small business men who still survived were at the complete mercy of the Plutocracy
BTS He shook his head slowly pondering
BTS For look you they dream of making lucky voyages which will bring them more money of becoming the mates of ships of finding fortunes in short of being in a better position for preying on their fellows of having all night in good grub and somebody else to do the dirty work
BTS Cooky by the time you've finished pots and pans you'll be wanted on deck
BTS He could obey orders and he was neither curious nor garrulous
BTS A colossal and formless something was rushing across the field of his vision
BTS I often wondered why Wolf Larsen did not kill him and make an end of it
BTS The Oligarchy is about to tread upon our faces--yours and mine
BTS With the exception of Collie all things went well with White Fang
BTS The Indians heard it too
BTS The great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns and the shambling trot grew weak and weaker
BTS The time passed by and he slept intermittently for hours
BTS It was ridiculous and ungainly lying there on his back with legs sprawling in the air
BTS Perrault looked at his watch and swore
BTS Leach one of the men who were murdered had moral courage to an unusual degree
BTS Then you have not protested
BTS The result was that the Iron Heel was firmly established in the New World
BTS Besides the whole thing in popular slang was cooked up
BTS I was thrown flat on the wet deck and before I could scramble to my feet I heard the scream of the women
BTS and while he circled he watched the club so as to dodge it if thrown by Francois for he was become wise in the way of clubs
BTS The cub received a clout on the other side of his head
BTS The gods were ever crafty and they had unguessed ways of attaining their ends
BTS he began with a suaveness that was cold and of the temper of steel
BTS Ernest queried
BTS Shackled he was hand an' foot with his mate
BTS Therefore it won't be a general strike
BTS He merely thrashed his team-mates
BTS And the Church is dumb to-day
BTS Wolf Larsen's voice brought me sharply back to myself
BTS He made overtures to White Fang from the first
BTS Dr
BTS His face was blistering in the heat his eyebrows and lashes were singed off and the heat was becoming unbearable to his feet
BTS The wind had fallen to a whisper the ocean was growing calmer and calmer and this coupled with the presence of the great herd made a perfect hunting day one of the two or three days to be encountered in the whole of a lucky season
BTS Let him go Leach commanded
BTS And in the end who knows in what day the common people will rise up out of the abyss
BTS H
BTS You are right
BTS A thousand looms assembled in a large factory and driven by a central engine wove cloth vastly more cheaply than could the cottage weavers on their hand-looms
BTS A heavy price of gold was upon his head
BTS Are you discussing the ideal man
BTS The other kind included all live things that moved
BTS He was quite out of himself and I noticed the unconscious movement of his lips as he shaped word for word as fast as she uttered them
BTS The boat contained four men and its fifth occupant was certainly a woman
BTS I ain't seen a rabbit sign for days
BTS There was nothing else for him to do
BTS From shoulder to wrist of the crossed arms the coat-sleeve blue flannel shirt and undershirt were ripped in rags while the arms themselves were terribly slashed and streaming blood
BTS The heritage was too compelling for a wolf that was only a cub
BTS They were slack in all things without order or discipline
BTS The next instant he had drawn up his legs and rolled clear
BTS By this time he had swung fully around and was facing me
BTS It was intended that the reader should feel his way to these glimmerings
BTS I wouldn't give two whoops in hell for a dog that wouldn't fight for his own meat
BTS But with such a powerful combination as the Oligarchy and the big unions is there any reason to believe that the Revolution will ever triumph
BTS So acute did his hunger become at times that he was not above rooting out wood-mice from their burrows in the ground
BTS Feel them he commanded
BTS It's damned tame whatever it is comin' in here at feedin' time an' gettin' its whack of fish
BTS Men call him Death' Larsen
BTS It savoured of the trap of bondage
BTS He could not encounter that howling horde with his tail and hind-quarters
BTS Jim Hall had only his naked hands and his teeth
BTS They dropped their whole supply of expedite upon the locomotive
BTS He was a helot in the great hunt of helots that the masters were making
BTS he had buried his teeth in the flesh of a foe
BTS From cabin to forecastle it seems to have broken out like a contagion
BTS and I learned not long afterward that the berry was likewise a little weakness of Maud's
BTS He was delighted
BTS Say Henry he asked suddenly how many dogs did you say we had
BTS Kelly asked and as he went on he looked murderously about him unless one of us peaches
BTS Spencer
BTS He looked at the house as if debating whether or not he should come in and try to sell some of his wares
BTS This made hard times for the men
BTS Some bands in strong positions fought gallantly but in the end every deserter from the militia met death
BTS As Buck grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games in which Thornton himself could not forbear to join
BTS The team stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line ready for the trail
BTS Nor has the worthlessness of the working class
BTS I could not feel the full force of the wind for we were running with it
BTS We will meet him most probably on the Japan coast
BTS My headache had not gone away
BTS The surpluses will have to be expended somehow he answered
BTS In 1906 A
BTS He's gone off his food again Matt remarked from his bunk
BTS There was a great fluttering and flapping of canvas and reef-points most welcome to my ears then she filled away on the other tack
BTS Ernest and the socialist leaders fought fiercely to capture the farmers
BTS And then everything was suddenly made clear
BTS Not that he personally objected--oh no
BTS And this is the first time I have ever heard the word pronounced
BTS If it has never been discovered all these years it may never be discovered
BTS No was his answer
BTS I made no complaint but Wolf Larsen demanded the most punctilious sea etiquette in my case far more than poor Johansen had ever received
BTS and besides the sail lashed to the spare oars dragged in the sea ahead of us
BTS Value of life
BTS And yet though I even removed the handcuffs we could not adjust ourselves to his condition
BTS But as often as he gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade the love for John Thornton drew him back to the fire again
BTS He ran again through the silence hunting his living food through the months of famine
BTS When among men fighting to the death in their wild-animal way a beaten man threw down his weapons it was at the option of the victor to slay him or spare him
BTS He backed up Spitz with his whip while Buck backed up the remainder of the team
BTS The peculiar knowledge of the pilot and captain sufficed for many thousands of people who knew no more of the sea and navigation than I knew
BTS A temporary pause when taken off his guard gave him the vital moment in which to think and determine his action
BTS Charles was a middle-aged lightish-colored man with weak and watery eyes and a mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up giving the lie to the limply drooping lip it concealed
BTS Four sleds pulled in from the river bed to the camp among the trees
BTS It was a feeling nothing more and yet none the less potent
BTS If you refused to go into the militia or to obey after you were in you would be tried by drumhead court martial and shot down like dogs
BTS Will you have some beef
BTS I have often thought so myself and wondered why
BTS The speed with which I ran from the galley caused excruciating pain in my knee and I sank down helplessly at the break of the poop
BTS It was a placing of his destiny in another's hands a shifting of the responsibilities of existence
BTS Ernest laughed
BTS Then dirt and weather-beat shall be your guerdon of honour I said holding them in mine
BTS Buck did not like her but he was feeling too miserable to resist her taking it as part of the day's miserable work
BTS His only food was meat live meat that ran away swiftly before him or flew into the air or climbed trees or hid in the ground or faced him and fought with him or turned the tables and ran after him
BTS Get a move on
BTS The lack of expression on his face so different from when I had watched him unseen was enhanced by the unblinking staring eyes
BTS With him were other boys
BTS Some were lying down with heads raised and ears pricked forward
BTS The children struck in all the schools and such teachers as came went home again from deserted class rooms
BTS The relations among the men strained and made tense by feuds quarrels and grudges were in a state of unstable equilibrium and evil passions flared up in flame like prairie-grass
BTS I am paralysed
BTS As he talked with reluctant movements he drew his revolver threw open the cylinder and assured himself of its contents
BTS I am smiling
BTS that arose out of coarse feelings and blunted sensibilities from natures that knew neither courtesy nor gentleness
BTS And he himself had gone into the mills when he was ten
BTS White Fang's gods were always hunting animals
BTS There were other voices
BTS Judge Miller's place it was called
BTS White Fang was howling as dogs howl when their masters lie dead
BTS Go on Henry pleaded elevating the pot
BTS When a man was captured he was given fair trial and opportunity for defence
BTS He had never dreamed that his own kind consisted of more than One Eye his mother and himself
BTS The next day we waited and the next and still he made no sign
BTS All my days had been passed in comparative ignorance of the animality of man
BTS As the time went by he had fewer and fewer fights
BTS It was aglow with light as the sea itself and the eyes were flashing in the starshine
BTS These were conscious actions and were the results of his first generalisations upon the world
BTS It will make a sensation I asserted
BTS He wore the uniform of the Mercenaries
BTS But nothing I could do seemed to relieve him
BTS Food
BTS A cry of startled admiration went up
BTS That it is unfortunate especially if you have any engagements falling due in the course of the next several months
BTS There was a great snarling and yelping
BTS So it was when the doom of fifty years of living death was uttered by Judge Scott that Jim Hall hating all things in the society that misused him rose up and raged in the court-room until dragged down by half a dozen of his blue-coated enemies
BTS Also we used Wickson's cream and butter and Ernest was not above shooting Wickson's quail and rabbits and on occasion his young bucks
BTS This instinct is stronger than any ethic they possess
BTS Yet its defeat did not put an end to the hard times
BTS What ho
BTS I had come down to the deck and I saw Horner and Kerfoot vainly protest against the attempt
BTS He spoke of his birth in the working class and of the sordidness and wretchedness of his environment where flesh and spirit were alike starved and tormented
BTS Down at the very first he had been unable to gain his feet and for all of his tremendous strength I felt that there was no hope for him
BTS Every hour was filled with shock and surprise
BTS He was learning to calculate his own muscular movements to know his physical limitations to measure distances between objects and between objects and himself
BTS But can you wonder that we lose patience with you
BTS Here you
BTS I exclaimed
BTS Their children attended schools especially built for them and in these schools manual training and applied science were specialized upon
BTS Sometimes they went hungry sometimes they feasted riotously all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting
BTS and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley toward camp he proceeded with greater caution
BTS White Fang sniffed the puppy curiously whereupon Kiche rushed upon him gashing his face a second time
BTS Like a cat White Fang bowed his hind-quarters in and with the feet digging into his enemy's abdomen above him he began to claw with long tearing-strokes
BTS He slowly moved his head back and forth under it and turned from side to side now in the sunshine now in the shade feeling the shadow as it were testing it by sensation
BTS The smallest fee he would deign to notice was a hundred thousand dollars
BTS their muscles ached their bones ached their very hearts ached
BTS But it was work hard work all of it
BTS Even so it was a hard fight and it aroused the last latent remnants of Buck's ferocity
BTS Major had made a spring for the meat
BTS Suddenly from the cabin came a great choking bellow followed by all the sounds of a furious struggle
BTS Of what use the four walls without a roof
BTS Thornton's doubt was strong in his face but his fighting spirit was aroused the fighting spirit that soars above odds fails to recognize the impossible and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle
BTS I was beginning to see through the appearances of the society in which I had always lived and to find the frightful realities that were beneath
BTS I told him that unhappily for the burial service I was not a preacher when he sharply demanded What do you do for a living
BTS As it began to flame up the circle of eyes drew farther back
BTS Yet that smoke which blinded me and made me cough and gasp must have a source
BTS At the sight of him as he came out of the cabin they sprang upon him
BTS With a restless movement he rolled his head around clearing his left ear from the pillow against which it had been pressed
BTS He got hold toward the base where the neck comes out from the shoulders
BTS and every minute or so the group of hunters gave mouth to a laughter that sounded to me like a wolf-chorus or the barking of hell-hounds
BTS He was surprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was communicated to him
BTS Perhaps she had gone up
BTS Convention the Bishop being a gentle soul had yielded to the friendly pressure brought to bear upon him and had gone away on a vacation
BTS The cubs slept while the life that was in them flickered and died down
BTS The guilty man or woman was placed in a specially constructed death-chair and under the supervision of competent physicians was destroyed by a current of electricity
BTS He would be lying in camp dozing lazily in the heat of the day when suddenly his head would lift and his ears cock up intent and listening and he would spring to his feet and dash away and on and on for hours through the forest aisles and across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched
BTS He yelped in his fright
BTS I talked with an eye-witness and he said that the nearest any militiaman approached the machine-guns was a hundred and fifty yards
BTS Ernest is a very remarkable man he said when he got back and while I was helping him off with his overcoat
BTS The Thirty Mile River was wide open
BTS In short a sudden colossal stunning blow was to be struck
BTS No labor consumes all of the total product that its wages will buy back
BTS He may be uneducated but he certainly knows how to express the significance of the written word
BTS She responded and I made sure of her
BTS Also their effect was irritating for Cherokee began to growl very softly deep down in his throat
BTS He is not accustomed to the presence of ladies anyway
BTS The blow was like a flash of light
BTS Six cents lady she said nodding her head gently while she went on stitching
BTS Till dinner-time she corrected remembering the arrangement on the Ghost
BTS These openings grew in size the segments diminished
BTS Yes Beauty Smith grunted shrinking away
BTS They hurled stones wielded sticks and clubs and whips administered slaps and clouts and when they touched him were cunning to hurt with pinch and twist and wrench
BTS He's untamable
BTS And next the sharp voice of an officer
BTS Very often
BTS he snorted a moment later
BTS See all is ready
BTS It did not occur to him that this fearlessness was founded upon experience and knowledge
BTS But it was not Wolf Larsen's whim to annihilate him
BTS What else was I to do
BTS and it would have seemed that his mental development was well-nigh complete
BTS White Fang snarled at the sound of his voice but this time did not leap away from under the hand that was caressing his head and the back of his neck with long soothing strokes
BTS At the instant his voice broke the silence White Fang leaped back snarling savagely at him
BTS He was lying on his left side at the time and in evident pain
BTS A few years ago we dairymen had everything our own way
BTS When at last he came to a stop he gave one last agonised yell and then a long whimpering wail
BTS Night came but neither of us slept
BTS Cringing and snivelling himself before the blows or angry speech of a man he revenged himself in turn upon creatures weaker than he
BTS She herself was an executioner for the Fighting Groups and known as the Red Virgin she became one of the inspired figures of the Revolution
BTS Louis tells me that the gossip of the sailors finds its way aft and that two of the telltales have been badly beaten by their mates
BTS Somewhere a boot thumped loudly and at irregular intervals against the wall
BTS Pray come down to earth and tell me precisely what you do mean by philosophy
BTS and here one afternoon I was drowsing half asleep over a volume of Mendenhall
BTS And that it was grave I instanced his statement that he intended to stay and die on Endeavour Island
BTS You will be discharged was the warning
BTS Behind him would be Mit-sah the great whip singing in his hand
BTS And in the enforced solitude of the sanitarium he recovered
BTS White Fang bristled and snarled and snapped in the face of the open-mouthed oncoming wave of dogs and went down and under them feeling the sharp slash of teeth in his body himself biting and tearing at the legs and bellies above him
BTS Dr
BTS Again Mr
BTS Of cheap things it is the cheapest
BTS Anna Roylston carried out the execution
BTS Ye should iv seen the old man's face
BTS Everhard here clearly develops the cause of all the labor troubles of that time
BTS and coming home late at night worn out from the strain of the campaign he would plunge into his translating and toil on well into the morning hours
BTS But she only snarled at him and he walked out alone into the bright sunshine to find the snow-surface soft under foot and the travelling difficult
BTS I ain't a-goin' to be robbed
BTS ' he snorted
BTS Henry acknowledged receipt of the information with a grunt that slid into a snore as he drifted back into sleep
BTS Then also the idea of the general strike caught the mood of the people
BTS Not a word that Bishop Morehouse had uttered was in print
BTS What of the hard times and the consequent vast army of the unemployed
BTS One Eye half arose in his excitement his ears up his tail straight out and quivering behind him
BTS for I was knocked down by their surging bodies and badly bruised
BTS The capture and secret execution of Everhard was the great event of the spring of 1932 A
BTS They were only hot-air balloons clumsily and hastily made but they did the work
BTS Mugridge with a sharp howl of pain humbly begged everybody's pardon
BTS The code he learned was to obey the strong and to oppress the weak
BTS I looked proudly at my work
BTS Better turn in now and get some sleep
BTS That night he lifted the long wolf-howl
BTS Anything warm would have been most gratifying
BTS Wolf Larsen was counting his winnings
BTS For that matter I do him a kindness
BTS There are viols in your voice he said bluntly and his eyes flashed their golden light
BTS but we worked together
BTS I had had no responsibilities at all
BTS The Ghost was being wrenched and torn to fragments
BTS The boat lost headway and as we lifted on a huge surge toppled and fell into the trough
BTS They were all about him and upon him
BTS At the next crossing several similar smoke pillars were rising skyward in the direction of the West Side
BTS Besides the water was frightfully cold and his was anything but a rugged constitution
BTS The lazarette where such delicacies were stored was situated beneath the cabin floor
BTS Not God not Mammon but Power
BTS He has a wife and children I chided
BTS He looked very sick
BTS By that last statement you have given me back my premise
BTS And yet it was only a quarter of a mile from Wickson's hunting-lodge and a short mile from the village of Glen Ellen
BTS The situation was something that really exceeded rational formulas for conduct and demanded more than the cold conclusions of reason
BTS Yes Matt went on I know you've tried to but you didn't take a club
BTS Once a month its members gathered at some one of their private houses to listen to a lecture
BTS The cub found no more milk in his mother's breast nor did he get one mouthful of meat for himself
BTS I queried
BTS Then I had found myself attracted toward him
BTS Yet Bishop Morehouse was not aware of it
BTS People eat therefore they must procure the wherewithal
BTS By an arbitrary ruling of the Post Office these editions were decided to be not the regular circulation of the paper and for that reason were denied admission to the mails
BTS There were other run-ways and alleys where rabbits were hanging in the air and the wolf-pair prospected them all the she-wolf leading the way old One Eye following and observant learning the method of robbing snares a knowledge destined to stand him in good stead in the days to come
BTS The man sprang for his throat but Buck was too quick for him
BTS It was a brief fight and fierce
BTS also there were official orders
BTS It was the treatment he had received from the time he was a little pulpy boy in a San Francisco slum soft clay in the hands of society and ready to be formed into something
BTS He spoke carelessly enough but there was real fear behind the speech
BTS At last I am a consecrated spirit
BTS No recipe of it has come down to us
BTS This laughter was uproarious and scornful and at the same time the god pointed his finger derisively at White Fang
BTS I shall not take the vacation
BTS I had quite forgotten the existence of Leach and Johnson when suddenly like a thunderclap Boat ho
BTS He held that it did that it could swim the moment it was born
BTS It was before this steady wind that he hoped to make the major portion of the run to Japan curving south into the tropics and north again as he approached the coast of Asia
BTS White Fang did not repeat his attack on the foot
BTS By dawn what with the rowing of the fishermen we made the Marin Islands
BTS They ran through the night
BTS They were accomplishing nothing and the best they hoped for was the putting of an end to the legislative farce in which they were unwilling players
BTS At that moment the newcomer's fist landed a smashing blow full in his face
BTS He broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs
BTS Buck saw money pass between them and was not surprised when Curly a good-natured Newfoundland and he were led away by the little weazened man
BTS In their desperation they ravaged the farms for food and the consequent tumult and anarchy in the country districts but increased the woes of the poor expropriated farmers
BTS The clay of him had been so moulded in the making
BTS A number of the labor leaders had been executed
BTS Then we entered the fog
BTS I'll admit I don't like defeat any more than you do or any more than I like the idea of killing such pretty inoffensive creatures
BTS CHAPTER IX Three days of rest three blessed days of rest are what I had with Wolf Larsen eating at the cabin table and doing nothing but discuss life literature and the universe the while Thomas Mugridge fumed and raged and did my work as well as his own
BTS All hands lined the rail
BTS Suddenly he snapped striking with his fangs like a snake
BTS But if it was a bluff he intended it did not work
BTS CHAPTER XII THE BISHOP It was after my marriage that I chanced upon Bishop Morehouse
BTS Next day time and again the baying hounds came down the canyon plunged off to the left on the trail Carlson had made for them and were lost to ear in the farther canyons high up the mountain
BTS Together they went down soldier and slave into the welter
BTS Say Henry that other one that come in an' got a fish why didn't the dogs pitch into it
BTS Stealing backward glances as he ran he was always ready to whirl around and down the overzealous pursuer that outran his fellows
BTS He no longer sprawled and straddled and already he was developing the gait of his mother slinking and furtive apparently without exertion yet sliding along with a swiftness that was as deceptive as it was imperceptible
BTS When she rushed at him he turned his fur-protected shoulder to her sharp teeth and walked away stiff-legged and stately
BTS Really Hump I don't know
BTS It was Henderson's boat and with him had been lost Holyoak and Williams another of the deep-water crowd
BTS As the sounds of the ship thrusting herself through the waves were hurled back upon us by the fog so were one's thoughts
BTS He may be dead
BTS you may have to sail with me for a time he said quite softly with a silken threat that belied the softness as they moved slowly to comply and we might as well start with a friendly understanding
BTS but we learned about it afterward
BTS and when the red light and the white had disappeared we returned to the cabin to finish the interrupted supper
BTS As for the vital industries everything prospered
BTS He shook his head
BTS It is combination versus competition a thousand centuries long struggle in which competition has always been worsted
BTS No salt mines this time Smoke
BTS Then the next moment we would lift and soar upward while they sank far down beneath us
BTS But this is   He paused awhile for the word murder was his final judgment
BTS Since we knew nothing about the bomb and since a bomb actually was exploded and since the authorities had prepared in advance for the explosion it is only fair to conclude that the Iron Heel did know
BTS Crickets sang in the nights and in the days all manner of creeping crawling things rustled forth into the sun
BTS They killed him
BTS In the morning when the master came out on to the porch fifty white Leghorn hens laid out in a row by the groom greeted his eyes
BTS he never did more than turn his dull eyes upon the man then drop his head back to its customary position on his fore-paws
BTS Judge Scott's suggestion of a trained nurse was indignantly clamoured down by the girls who themselves undertook the task
BTS The dog was thoroughly alive to its danger but it was running on the outer circle while the wolf-pack was running on the inner and shorter circle
BTS Public-spirited citizens took down their rifles and went out after him
BTS Fatty's gone
BTS For the Bishop was sane and pure and noble
BTS We know and well we know by bitter experience that no appeal for the right for justice for humanity can ever touch you
BTS The days and nights are all a wonder and a wild delight and though I have little time from my dreary work I steal odd moments to gaze and gaze at the unending glory of what I never dreamed the world possessed
BTS In addition the persecution he had suffered from the pack had made the pack less to him in the scheme of things and man more
BTS They set their faces against the war
BTS The scorching torrent was enough to wither the face of the corpse
BTS One portion was what his own kind killed and ate
BTS and besides you pay for your moments of intellectual delight by having the blues
BTS Strait-jackets starvation and beatings and clubbings were the wrong treatment for Jim Hall
BTS Walled by the living clay that fierce intelligence we had known burned on
BTS But is he
BTS Not wholly he replied
BTS It's darn good coffee Henry said enticingly
BTS for this was the mail train carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow of the Pole
BTS And through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before
BTS the socialists were really justified in believing that the end of capitalism had come and in themselves throwing down the gauntlet to the Plutocracy
BTS But the Wild is the Wild and motherhood is motherhood at all times fiercely protective whether in the Wild or out of it
BTS I always thought they were afraid of men I said
BTS The lips moved
BTS I see
BTS Dispense with all the moral courage you can I said briskly
BTS You was born a gentleman
BTS Give me an intellectual answer to my intellectual charge that the capitalist class has mismanaged society
BTS I never knew before what money was good for
BTS But it was not his whim
BTS They will jeer at me when I prophesy and prophesy with the utmost confidence that at the next presidential election the socialists will poll over a million votes
BTS Packed with the pulse of an unborn race Torn with a world's desire The surging flood of my wild young blood Would quench the judgment fire
BTS But there was no play about it
BTS The hunter in turn was in a quandary
BTS It was a pleasant evening indeed and we voted that as a social function on Endeavour Island it had not yet been eclipsed
BTS But the joy of shooting to hit is a most compelling thing when once you've learned how to shoot
BTS You are trespassing
BTS White Fang was to her a wolf the hereditary marauder who had preyed upon her flocks from the time sheep were first herded and guarded by some dim ancestor of hers
BTS In their very great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the bruise of the club
BTS For some unknown reason prompted mysteriously I did not undress but lay down fully clothed
BTS You found that you were and that the men you talked with were
BTS Aren't you
BTS You see I've
BTS Then before him at his feet he saw an extremely small live thing only several inches long a young weasel that like himself had disobediently gone out adventuring
BTS He's no slouch at dog-breakin' that's wot I say one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically
BTS Of the two of us you and I who is the greater coward
BTS Not alone was their work confined to unseen warfare with the secret agents of the Oligarchy
BTS it dripped from our rigging overhead
BTS Francois was surprised too when they shot out in a tangle from the disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble
BTS Not that I a confirmed and as Furuseth phrased it a temperamental idealist was to be compelled
BTS Later on in the fall of the year he saved John Thornton's life in quite another fashion
BTS He seemed pleased at my perspicacity
BTS He hesitated while he groped in his vocabulary and framed a complete answer
BTS Profit-sharing could be successful only in isolated cases in the midst of a system of industrial strife
BTS The sled-dogs had forgotten his prowess
BTS The more he came to know them the more they vindicated their superiority the more they displayed their mysterious powers the greater loomed their god-likeness
BTS This occurred in 2073 A
BTS A fig for superstition I said on Friday morning
BTS The fresh breeze was blowing right down upon us and I could hear the whistle plainly off to one side and a little ahead
BTS He was made dizzy by the swarming of them
BTS A change in the battle crushed him under both their bodies and wrenched loose his hold
BTS And who knows
BTS the dog-driver cried to Perrault
BTS not three hundred yards away
BTS And well he might be eighty feet above the deck to trust himself on those thin and jerking ropes
BTS You are machine-breakers
BTS She shook her head
BTS Into his snarl he incorporated all that was vicious malignant and horrible
BTS But the men were no longer eager as they pulled and hauled and I heard curses amongst them which left their lips smothered and as heavy and lifeless as were they
BTS The task we set ourselves was threefold
BTS The spar could not have missed me by many inches while it spurred me to action
BTS It was sitting on a log not a foot beyond the end of his nose
BTS He was the perfect scientist
BTS And White Fang resurrecting quite a deal of the old awe seemed to wilt and to shrink in upon himself and grow small as he cast about in his mind for a way to beat a retreat not too inglorious
BTS We'll see to that Wolf Larsen answered and elevated his voice in a call of Cooky
BTS What men have done I can do
BTS The problem of reinvestment became more serious
BTS I had never done any hard manual labour or scullion labour in my life
BTS The Mercenaries in the last days of the Iron Heel played an important role
BTS and yet I could not pull the triggers
BTS He looked upon our slum neighborhood as a great sociological laboratory and he had embarked upon an apparently endless orgy of investigation
BTS You have been outgeneralled and outclassed
BTS The dead man was an episode that was past an incident that was dropped in a canvas covering with a sack of coal while the ship sped along and her work went on
BTS The younger man's excitement and apprehension for White Fang was growing
BTS What if he should be feigning this
BTS They were poor people and unlettered
BTS On examination we found that he had three
BTS When a steamer arrived the men of the fort made it a point always to come down to the bank and see the fun
BTS I myself do not write untruthful things
BTS And so it went
BTS But the Mercenaries found it no easy task to cope with the people of the abyss and at the same time fight with the comrades
BTS No word needed to be spoken
BTS And now I guess you can go away
BTS At the end of two hours Thomas Mugridge put away knife and stone and held out his hand
BTS All he asked of other dogs was to be let alone
BTS But Charles and Hal did not know this
BTS A myriad laws governed all these things and determined conduct
BTS The man attempted to step out of his circle of flame but the wolves surged to meet him
BTS Here's your bandana
BTS Incidentally new facts were learned about the nature size and form of the earth and the Ptolemaic system went glimmering
BTS Though he did not know it by the weight of his body he clogged the action of the leg and thereby saved his mother much damage
BTS Quickly as a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack he could leap twice as quickly
BTS I'll get you out of this as soon as I can get a chance he assured me
BTS The sky had clouded and the train rushed on like a sullen thunderbolt through the gray pall of advancing day
BTS But I must not overwork it she broke in
BTS The months went by binding stronger and stronger the covenant between dog and man
BTS Then he sat down pointed his nose upward and howled
BTS And that was really the situation
BTS You'll find some old canvas in the sail-locker
BTS They successfully fought the damage suit he brought when he came out of hospital
BTS His body turned a half-somersault in the air and he would have landed on his back had he not twisted catlike still in the air in the effort to bring his feet to the earth
BTS I wouldn't be s'prised to see it wag its tail
BTS The days came and went but never the master
BTS Hard up there
BTS Chapter III
BTS He chuckled and thereafter spoke no more
BTS One sled he drove himself drawn by dogs he had traded for or borrowed
BTS The elder Scott looked incredulously first at White Fang then at Dick and finally at his son
BTS In truth my spells of resting were longer than those of working
BTS The three partners were lining a long and narrow poling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty-Mile Creek
BTS I shall never forget the change in him when I mentioned Jackson's case
BTS I arose obediently and went down the beach
BTS His tiny rages were much more terrible than theirs
BTS Because of this he made heroic efforts to arise and at last he stood on his four legs tottering and swaying back and forth
BTS If capital consumed its share the sum total of capital could not increase
BTS It was all a sad mistake
BTS At the same time Sydney Brooks writing in America in Harper's Weekly said You will not hear the socialists mentioned in Washington
BTS And so according to the clay of his nature and the pressure of his surroundings his character was being moulded into a certain particular shape
BTS but the life that is demanding to be born is limitless
BTS One Ear drew near to her still alert and cautious his tail and ears in the air his head held high
BTS I was aware of the compliment and pleased in that no threat had accompanied my instructions
BTS In no other way can be explained our sacrifices and martyrdoms
BTS Also such a war would create a large standing army that need never be disbanded while in the minds of the people would be substituted the issue America versus Germany in place of Socialism versus Oligarchy
BTS You mean
BTS The boat was leaping and pounding as it fell over the crests I could hear the seas rushing past and spray was continually being thrown aboard
BTS He was beaten down to movelessness by an overwhelming sense of his own weakness and littleness
BTS They were good to eat
BTS You see he said to her
BTS From out of the fog came the mournful tolling of a bell and I could see the pilot turning the wheel with great rapidity
BTS It was not his way
BTS Weedon Scott looked at him suspiciously
BTS One of our generalizations is that every system founded upon class and caste contains within itself the germs of its own decay
BTS His hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief and the right trouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle
BTS When they came near with their ominous hands he got up
BTS The weasel let go the cub and flashed at the she-wolf's throat missing but getting a hold on the jaw instead
BTS All he had to do when the strange dogs came ashore was to show himself
BTS And yet the mast was not swung entirely inboard
BTS His clutch on life was too strong
BTS It simply prolongs the fight this treachery of the big unions
BTS Buck whined with suppressed eagerness
BTS He didn't but he will an' he'll break that squarehead's heart or it's little I know iv the ways iv men on the ships iv the sea
BTS I noticed they grinned with satisfaction whenever they looked at the Macedonia's smoke which was rising higher and higher as she approached from the west
BTS He gave a great start of fright
BTS He was a graduate of the university had gone in for journalism and was then serving his apprenticeship as reporter on the most influential of the three newspapers
BTS You are quite a figure
BTS We will put back industry to its pre-trust stage
BTS We were lovers of Humanity
BTS I might have known it I said impatiently
BTS Wolf Larsen 'll do for me I know it
BTS I said with sudden solicitude
BTS This produced the desired effect
BTS Fire away and do not forget that I here challenge you to give the answer that Colonel Van Gilbert has failed to give
BTS Young Wickson put his hands up first then turned to confront Biedenbach who held a thirty-thirty automatic rifle on him
BTS Discipline was relaxed among the Mercenaries that remained while many regiments had been withdrawn and sent to various parts of the country
BTS Half as many is too much
BTS Imagine so salty a phrase on the lips of the Humphrey Van Weyden of a few months gone
BTS The shark dropped back into the sea helpless yet with its full strength doomed to lingering starvation a living death less meet for it than for the man who devised the punishment
BTS and White Fang's snarl slowly dwindled to a growl that ebbed down in his throat and ceased
BTS life swelled through his veins in full and magnificent flood
BTS I could hear the water rushing down upon the deck
BTS They were gods
BTS It was like the trap and all his instinct resented it and revolted against it
BTS Much I remembered possibly two-thirds of the quatrains and I managed to piece out the remainder without difficulty
BTS The sounds from below soon died away
BTS Withdrawn from the immediate scramble of the other dogs in fact out of sight behind a thicket he was devouring his prize when Baseek rushed in upon him
BTS Tie a rag around it and it'll be all right
BTS Do you know where you can get plenty of lead
BTS The man of him was not changed
BTS You surely have the answer forthcoming
BTS Humphrey
BTS but Mr
BTS But there came a time when the god refused to toss it
BTS Those that didn't starved
BTS The bottles were delivered but after two days
BTS Wounded creatures men and women were vomited over the top of that awful wave and fell squirming down the face of it till they threshed about under the automobiles and against the legs of the soldiers
BTS Make it do
BTS Why not fasten the tackle part way down the mast
BTS I was all alone
BTS When I had dressed and opened the door I heard the waves still lapping on the beach garrulously attesting the fury of the night
BTS Shall I lead
BTS I know nothing that I may say can influence you he said
BTS 'Oo ever did anything for me heh
BTS When I announced who I was I was promptly placed under arrest
BTS When their morality is questioned they grow only the more complacent and superior
BTS Have you sighted land yet
BTS In fact the business that brought me there the night of my visit was such a trial
BTS he shouted back
BTS and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission man man who is the most restless of life ever in revolt against the dictum that all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement
BTS As the Fighting Wolf he was known far and wide and the cage in which he was kept on the steam-boat's deck was usually surrounded by curious men
BTS And as though answering my unspoken thought he wailed I never 'ad no chance not 'arf a chance
BTS Especially notable were the machinists
BTS The war was declared off and the populations of both countries returned to their tasks
BTS Give us that which we have sought so long--the test of truth
BTS He's complaining and restless
BTS I may have learned to stand on my own legs I retorted
BTS How could he spring away with his four legs in the air above him
BTS for they worried me to distraction with their solicitude for my health and with their periodic inroads on my den when my orderly confusion upon which I prided myself was turned into worse confusion and less order though it looked neat enough to the eye
BTS On either side stretched lawns their broad sweep broken here and there by great sturdy-limbed oaks
BTS She was agreed that the most rigorous treatment was necessary if we were to escape though she recoiled at the suggestion that I might some time be compelled to take his life to save my own our own she put it
BTS he shouted
BTS The Congressional Record is here in Ardis and a reference to it shows mention of the bill on the following dates June 30 December 9 15 16 and 17 1902 and January 7 and 14 1903
BTS The hard times at home had caused an immense decrease in consumption
BTS The wood was seasoned and dry and it was tied so closely to his neck that he could scarcely get his teeth to it
BTS between the capitalists and the Western Federation of Miners similar but more bloody tactics were employed
BTS White Fang had never seen dogs before but at sight of them he felt that they were his own kind only somehow different
BTS The next instant they were opposite the poop where stood Wolf Larsen and I
BTS And though I had been surrounded by women all my days my appreciation of them had been aesthetic and nothing more
BTS She paused at the mouth of the cave and looked the wall over carefully
BTS The cost of advertising was amazing in those helter- skelter times
BTS All the dogs is licking him
BTS We are all caught up in the wheels and cogs of the industrial machine
BTS The little airs he put on and the painful striving to assume the easy carriage of a man born to a dignified place in life would have been sickening had they not been ludicrous
BTS But in the meantime God did not come and they starved to death in great numbers
BTS But my woman my mate kept ringing in my head for the rest of the day and for many days
BTS Wells in the late nineteenth century A
BTS Louis the boat-steerer had already begged me for condensed milk and sugar
BTS But upon his way he demanded consideration
BTS The world is ours we are its lords and ours it shall remain
BTS He has a splendidly disciplined mind
BTS In the meantime his two men as was the wont of visiting sailors had gone forward into the forecastle to do some visiting themselves
BTS Justice or injustice it was all the same he must take all things from the hands of his own gods
BTS He paused and regarded his listeners
BTS The log cabins he had known were replaced by towering buildings
BTS But scarcely had he lain down when Grey Beaver staggered over to him and tied a leather thong around his neck
BTS Asmunsen gave an answer and then he said Yes that's it except that we do not object to the others making profits so long as they are not extortionate
BTS But and there it is we want to live and move though we have no reason to because it happens that it is the nature of life to live and move to want to live and move
BTS While Wolf Larsen held his wrist he stirred uneasily bowing his body so that for a moment it rested on shoulders and heels
BTS He did not dare travel until dark
BTS I don't know I don't know Bill muttered ominously
BTS They are so pretty she objected
BTS By the power of our ballots on election day will we take your government away from you-- What if you do get a majority a sweeping majority on election day
BTS They were shaking and prodding him into consciousness
BTS Fair westerly breeze with a promise of stiffening if Louis predicts correctly
BTS I questioned eagerly
BTS To him Judge Scott was the keystone in the arch of injustice and upon Judge Scott he emptied the vials of his wrath and hurled the threats of his revenge yet to come
BTS You mean they think they're sure of us Henry objected pointedly
BTS I lifted the end of the hatch cover and the canvas-shrouded body slipped feet first into the sea
BTS Part way up Sonoma Mountain John Carlson let the girls go on leading his horse while he went back on foot
BTS At the first cut of the whip White Fang left the chicken for the man
BTS Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities
BTS God was more powerful as he said Whom thunder hath made greater
BTS This foreshadowing of a slow social evolution was made when Ernest was first depressed by the defection of the great unions
BTS You were not fair to yourself nor to me
BTS He shifted his grip in a bit
BTS They dwelt in cities of their own which were practically self-governed and they were granted many privileges
BTS I queried
BTS but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil
BTS With night came horror
BTS No one knew what was happening
BTS I held that space was an apparition of God and that soul was a projection of the character of God
BTS The master nodded his head
BTS Then they came upon moose
BTS How had he happened to be
BTS You
BTS Trouble was always afoot and at the bottom of it was Buck
BTS You kick it into the ditch
BTS I must take it to her at once
BTS Louis was at the wheel
BTS The big leaders of the Grangers saw the peril and were with us to a man
BTS He shoved the slide part way back and rested his arms on it his body still in the companion-way
BTS It had been slit from top to bottom along the centre seam and it pulsed rhythmically the slit opening and closing regularly with every leap of the wearer
BTS But the squirrel was as badly scared
BTS I dropped fifty thousand dollars in that venture
BTS the Bishop said
BTS So it was that the regular troops fought for their lives as well as did the farmers
BTS Couldn't drive 'em away from the fire with a club Bill agreed
BTS He had evidently delayed reporting preferring to wait until he had brought things to a successful conclusion by discovering my hiding-place and capturing me
BTS Pocock won his spurs as a slave-driver and earned the undying hatred of the proletariat
BTS He had eaten the lynx kitten
BTS And stand by to back over the jibs
BTS The law was EAT OR BE EATEN
BTS Especially did they enjoy the havoc worked amongst the newcomers' dogs by White Fang and his disreputable gang
BTS And here I was with dreary and endless vistas before me of table-setting potato-peeling and dish-washing
BTS He had made no noise yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense his presence
BTS To my amused chagrin he discovered my shoes on the forecastle head and brought them back with him into the galley
BTS His wolfish appearance caught their eyes at once and they pointed him out to one another
BTS Each man seemed stunned deeply contemplative as it were and not quite sure trying to realize just what had taken place
BTS Buck's senses came back to him but not his strength
BTS Oh yes you are the other assured him
BTS It has no value
BTS We were falling in the trough they were rising on the surge
BTS His eyelids drooped and went shut and his whole body seemed to relax and flatten out upon the floor
BTS He had armed himself with a draw-knife from the tool-locker and with this he prepared to cut across the throat-halyards I had again rigged to the shears
BTS Times have changed since Christ's day
BTS she quavered
BTS The Church does not know
BTS My knife was at my hip
BTS I know he said quietly though his face was growing darker
BTS A vast silence reigned over the land
BTS I am disgusted with you gentlemen members of my class
BTS The master talked to him gently but seriously and he cocked his ears and listened with painful intentness
BTS I have said that he was afraid of nothing
BTS he cried coming back with a heavy club in his hand
BTS It did not require much exertion to pick these quarrels
BTS It was very close
BTS And why not
BTS I tried to rise but struck my head and was knocked back on hands and knees
BTS Once inside the little cabin I saw Ernest's face in the light
BTS Only this time he was the one who was beaten
BTS Also the beggar said that there was talk tea-table gossip and so forth about my daughter being seen in public with so notorious a character as you and that it was not in keeping with university tone and dignity
BTS His wonderful constitution kept him up
BTS I looked about me at their faces and saw that they remained complacently superior to what he had charged
BTS I can get along very comfortably on my own income and the salary is all they can take away from me
BTS On the contrary she grew more excited and angry every moment until in the end White Fang flung dignity to the winds and frankly fled away from her across the fields
BTS He halted with awkward abruptness with stiff fore-legs bracing himself against his momentum almost sitting down on his haunches so desirous was he of avoiding contact with the dog he was in the act of attacking
BTS Henry
BTS Buck did not attack but circled him about and hedged him in with friendly advances
BTS The tackle dragged heavily across the rail increasing its drag as the spar arose more and more out of the water and the exertion on the windlass grew severe
BTS There lies the temptation
BTS On the other hand instead of walking away at sight of them he waited for them to come to him
BTS The Oligarchy would see to that
BTS father began then paused
BTS To the end of the boom I had likewise rigged a hoisting tackle
BTS Also their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished
BTS There was no need for his working at all because Ernest managed to earn enough from his translating to take care of the three of us
BTS Grey Beaver had betrayed and forsaken him but that had no effect upon him
BTS He had just closed his hand with a steady pressure
BTS Get a knife somebody
BTS Besides the law of meat there were a myriad other and lesser laws for him to learn and obey
BTS I knew every inch of the way
BTS The expropriators are expropriated
BTS He plunged through the wooded breast of the island flew down to the lower end crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island gained a third island curved back to the main river and in desperation started to cross it
BTS While Maud was passing me the provisions and I was storing them in the boat a sailor came on deck from the forecastle
BTS And yet there was Jackson
BTS Any signs of fog
BTS He looked at me coolly and uttered a low whistle of surprise
BTS One Eye ran ahead cautiously his mate at his heels
BTS With the power that is yours you might have risen to any height
BTS Especially adept did he become in stalking small living things
BTS He was behaving as a wolf-father should and manifesting no unholy desire to devour the young lives she had brought into the world
BTS But what in thunder are you repairing
BTS You kick with your legs
BTS They did not go far a couple of days' journey
BTS They knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the face of that driving current was a matter of minutes and they ran as fast as they could up the bank to a point far above where Thornton was hanging on
BTS He's a downright murderer I know was the dog-musher's comment
BTS They were creatures of mastery possessing all manner of unknown and impossible potencies overlords of the alive and the not alive making obey that which moved imparting movement to that which did not move and making life sun-coloured and biting life to grow out of dead moss and wood
BTS Then I saw red again
BTS You've long years before you and you can make anything you please of yourself
BTS Are we all agreed so far
BTS And truly the religious revival assumed formidable proportions
BTS He could not understand at first
BTS All intelligence was gone
BTS There did you see that
BTS And then the cub saw his mother the she-wolf the fearless one crouching down till her belly touched the ground whimpering wagging her tail making peace signs
BTS He fell into it
BTS Is not this pessimism of the blackest
BTS A fair wind and a flowing sheet you know or however it goes
BTS He took Buck by the scruff of the neck and though the dog growled threateningly dragged him to one side and replaced Sol-leks
BTS As I lay with my eyes closed I heard the same dull sound of distant explosions
BTS But he was not in the least disturbed by desire to find out the reason for the difference between his father and himself
BTS And even while I was oppressed by the enormity of my sin for sin it was I chuckled with an insane delight
BTS There was no more shooting though the rifles were still cracking merrily from the other boats
BTS Usually this occurred at night so as to avoid interference from the mounted police of the Territory
BTS I was only five feet away and directly in what should have been his line of vision
BTS but with the melting of the snow and the opening of the streams the Indian camp had moved away and that source of supply was closed to him
BTS He had always been susceptible to the laughter of the gods
BTS Mugridge sat down on the raised threshold to the galley and went on with his knife-sharpening
BTS The tide could not have carried the masts far to seaward and there had been no wind
BTS and yet in a way this handling and directing of many men was good for me
BTS By your own confession the trust machines do the work more efficiently and more cheaply than you can
BTS The Trust could put milk upon the market more cheaply than we
BTS The wild Indian is not so brutal and savage as the capitalist class he answered
BTS There was an endurance as of perpetual youth about him which rose up and forbade the picture
BTS The courts interpret the Constitution and the courts as Mr
BTS In the fevered imagination of fear they thought they saw that was all
BTS The pencil dropped and we had to replace it in the hand
BTS Standard Oil and Rockefeller--see upcoming footnote Rockefeller began as a member
BTS while two or three fools more or less would not alter the scheme of things
BTS His world was very small
BTS Again he awakened a little later though it seemed hours to him
BTS Turn in all hands and get some sleep
BTS But it was jammed beneath the overturned sled and by the time Henry had helped him to right the load One Ear and the she-wolf were too close together and the distance too great to risk a shot
BTS Other men call me Wolf
BTS To him it signified death
BTS White Fang came upon him unexpectedly
BTS He deluged me overwhelmed me with argument
BTS But now that it had come I could not believe
BTS He was kept chained in a pen at the rear of the fort and here Beauty Smith teased and irritated and drove him wild with petty torments
BTS And make all haste I added as she turned toward her state-room
BTS As Buck grew winded Spitz took to rushing and he kept him staggering for footing
BTS We must provoke no scenes with this man nor cross his will
BTS Unconscious of my blunder I passed by Wolf Larsen and the hunter and flung the ashes over the side to windward
BTS Then when he sprang out upon it it would transform itself into an electric car menacing and terrible towering over him like a mountain screaming and clanging and spitting fire at him
BTS but long years of bookish silence had made me inattentive and unprepared
BTS Both noses went down to the footprints in the snow
BTS But Beauty Smith kept a wary eye on him and the club was held always ready to strike
BTS The Cause for this one time was lost but the Cause would be here to-morrow the same Cause ever fresh and ever burning
BTS After that the rest would be easy
BTS His intention was apparent enough
BTS In the interval the city had disappeared
BTS He knew only that the velvet-furred kitten was meat and he ate and waxed happier with every mouthful
BTS The mind recoiled from contemplation of a world beyond this wet veil which wrapped us around
BTS So did I go for'ard
BTS He was right he knew he was right and he was unafraid
BTS That is why you are crying out your feeble little battle-cry 'Return to the ways of our fathers
BTS Compared with White Fang they were frail and flabby and clutched life without any strength in their grip
BTS And that is what your church is standing for what you are preaching for every time you get up in the pulpit
BTS He rose high under the rule of the Iron Heel and finally was translated into the oligarch class
BTS There was no escape for White Fang
BTS He had left the cave and run down to the stream to drink
BTS Wouldn't take a sou less so help me
BTS Not only did they not know how to work dogs but they did not know how to work themselves
BTS How it happened was sufficient for him
BTS He would have to learn the reality of a thing before he could put his faith into it
BTS yet the drivers were fair through it all and did their best for the animals
BTS Watch out
BTS I looked into his face
BTS J
BTS his voice rang out in warning to his comrades
BTS These emissaries of the Iron Heel disguised themselves as artisans farmers and farm laborers
BTS Why we even depended much in our plan on the unorganized people of the abyss
BTS and they uttered glib phrases that their own ears did not understand
BTS A thousand times no
BTS White Fang's feel of Beauty Smith was bad
BTS Strange to say and I noted it all once Wolf Larsen's features showed no such evil stamp
BTS The latter's breath was drawn with greater and greater difficulty as the moments went by
BTS But I take the money under protest he added
BTS And after the guests were gone I learned how he had met him passing down a street at night and stopping to listen to a man on a soap-box who was addressing a crowd of workingmen
BTS He suddenly released me and staggered away
BTS Cautiously descending I found the cabin deserted
BTS But how in the name of the great Sardanapolis he knows you're goin' is what gets me the dog-musher continued innocently
BTS He has said that it is their intention to take away from us our governments our palaces and all our purpled ease
BTS White Fang knew the meaning of home and though he did not understand the remainder of the master's language he knew it was his will that he should go home
BTS When Thornton passed a caressing hand along his back a snapping and crackling followed the hand each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact
BTS for the act in question that sent fifty-two Congressmen to prison was on a par with countless other acts committed by the oligarchs and before them by the capitalists
BTS Once more I woke troubled because I could sleep no better
BTS But the right
BTS Family life ceased
BTS It is all in the records against you
BTS He did not permit it
BTS Then came the Milk Trust
BTS Behind this lay our secret
BTS You said so yourself Mr
BTS Hal drew his long hunting-knife
BTS Woven into her being was the memory of countless crimes he and his had perpetrated against her ancestry
BTS Never mind that man she said pointedly
BTS I've got the rheumatism in my hands
BTS I'll give you a thousand  I began but was interrupted
BTS He had lain so long that his muscles had lost their cunning and all the strength had gone out of them
BTS a second bragged six hundred for his dog
BTS The barometer was down and the sky to the east did not please him
BTS The cause of it all as near as I could make out was that the man who was mate had gone on a debauch before leaving San Francisco and then had the poor taste to die at the beginning of the voyage and leave Wolf Larsen short-handed
BTS Or if some of the other secret-service comrades who have learned the truth can get there in time
BTS in other words they were of no importance either for wealth or position or exceptional ability
BTS Wolf Larsen was furious
BTS In vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog
BTS I had learned whenever he praised Ernest in such fashion to expect disaster
BTS He shook his head
BTS With the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind till the train made another stop when he floundered past the sleds to his own where he stood alongside Sol-leks
BTS It reminds me too strongly of a rat in a trap
BTS One could have read the finest print with ease
BTS He did not check himself but drove in upon Spitz shoulder to shoulder so hard that he missed the throat
BTS I was learning more and more seamanship
BTS Several times during the night he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open expecting to see the Judge or the boys at least
BTS I've heard that song sung by the middle class and where is it now in its might
BTS Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside he was there on the inside snarling and growling as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out
BTS It is no pleasant picture I can conjure up of myself Humphrey Van Weyden in that noisome ship's galley crouched in a corner over my task my face raised to the face of the creature about to strike me my lips lifted and snarling like a dog's my eyes gleaming with fear and helplessness and the courage that comes of fear and helplessness
BTS But I'm goin' to lay for her
BTS A more immediate lesson however was impressed on the minds of the people by the punishment meted out to the Kansas militia
BTS They need a rest
BTS So did I
BTS He hated all things
BTS It was ahem shall we say Providence
BTS when they came to a narrow passage and the team closed together like a fan to go through
BTS It was a primitive mode of reasoning and of looking at things that he understood thoroughly
BTS He was overthrown
BTS My hands bothered me a great deal unused as they were to work
BTS John Cunningham Avis Everhard's father was a professor at the State University at Berkeley California
BTS He lurked in the forest avoiding discovery and robbing the snares at the rare intervals when game was caught
BTS At first I could not understand
BTS It was as though it had always been the wonted way of things
BTS He had attacked Johnson been attacked by Leach and had just finished whipping the pair of them
BTS They cursed him and his fathers and mothers before him and all his seed to come after him down to the remotest generation and every hair on his body and drop of blood in his veins
BTS The remaining forty received sentences varying from thirty to forty-five years
BTS In truth he was in better condition than when he had entered prison
BTS He had always disliked to have it touched
BTS On board the schooner the boat-pullers and steerers are the crew
BTS And furthermore every one of our imprisoned leaders was in contact with brave comrades who masqueraded in the livery of the Iron Heel
BTS and what of the decisive defeat administered all along the line to the labor unions
BTS I thought as much
BTS He walked as delicately as though all the snow were carpeted with porcupine quills erect and ready to pierce the soft pads of his feet
BTS How God must have hated them that they should be tortured so
BTS You understand
BTS When they called he came
BTS Again we climbed a ridge this time riding under red-limbed madronos and manzanitas of deeper red
BTS There that'll fix you fool critters Bill said with satisfaction that night standing erect at completion of his task
BTS My mind did not work quickly everything was so new and strange
BTS Go to it he said to White Fang
BTS At first their bullets zipped harmlessly along the surface of the water on either side the boat
BTS He broke down and began to cry and yelp
BTS After a long time the god got up and went into the cabin
BTS The mothers and children were put to work at the new machines
BTS That was to be expected
BTS Let's go back I said dejectedly
BTS Buck tightened the traces then slacked them for a matter of several inches
BTS I cried reproachfully and reached for his book and opened it
BTS But he was foredoomed and he went down with the she-wolf tearing savagely at his throat and with other teeth fixed everywhere upon him devouring him alive before ever his last struggles ceased or his last damage had been wrought
BTS He scraped furiously over a rock bruised across a second and struck a third with crushing force
BTS and the Ghost heeled about on the port tack with practically no noise at all
BTS There were seals about us and I was prepared to sight a sealing-schooner at any time
BTS But it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it that Buck excelled
BTS The wisest as well as strongest dog was the leader and the team obeyed him and feared him
BTS Every one of such countries has an unconsumed surplus
BTS At the fall of darkness they swung the dogs into a cluster of spruce trees on the edge of the waterway and made a camp
BTS Buck swung to the right ending the movement in a plunge that took up the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty pounds
BTS and by afternoon I was at work on the windlass
BTS Here was neither peace nor rest nor a moment's safety
BTS The Dominant Primordial Beast The dominant primordial beast was strong in Buck and under the fierce conditions of trail life it grew and grew
BTS This quarrel over the division was irreconcilable
BTS Please don't she begged
BTS But it was not Kiche's fault
BTS but there has been a diminishing and I am now able to eat you
BTS Not that he was a mere soap-box orator
BTS Then he went forward again
BTS The first Anarchist Maud laughed rising and preparing to withdraw to her state-room
BTS They did not fight
BTS Then I ran to the side
BTS You have done your work in the world and a great work
BTS It was open at In a Balcony and I noticed here and there passages underlined in pencil
BTS It left a great void in him somewhat akin to hunger but a void which ached and ached and which food could not fill At times when he paused to contemplate the carcasses of the Yeehats he forgot the pain of it
BTS He was too busy adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease and not only did he not pick fights but he avoided them whenever possible
BTS While from Kansas or Wisconsin or any other state your own comrades would go into the militia and come here to California to drown in blood your own civil-warring
BTS Collie had been taken in charge by one of the woman-gods who held arms around her neck and petted and caressed her
BTS At such times he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the tent where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master's breathing
BTS And all the while rolling plunging climbing the moving mountains and falling and wallowing in the foaming valleys the schooner Ghost was fighting her way farther and farther into the heart of the Pacific and I was on her
BTS That night the hounds were out and there was little sleep in the refuge
BTS The door closed and she was gone
BTS Look out
BTS And you permitted it
BTS By crossing and lashing the ends of two spars and then elevating them in the air like an inverted V I could get a point above the deck to which to make fast my hoisting tackle
BTS My mighty rhythm was the lift and forward plunge of a ship on the sea
BTS He tried to back away from her oblivious to the fact that by his hold on her he dragged her after him
BTS her large eyes larger than usual what of the purpose in them looked penetratingly into mine
BTS They did not take kindly to trace and trail
BTS She ran frantically hysterically straining to the utmost advertising the effort she was making with every leap and all the time White Fang slid smoothly away from her silently without effort gliding like a ghost over the ground
BTS But it did not all happen in a day this giving over of himself body and soul to the man-animals
BTS This man was Beauty Smith
BTS Leach laughed and hurled more of his Telegraph Hill Billingsgate and before either he or I knew what had happened his right arm had been ripped open from elbow to wrist by a quick slash of the knife
BTS It was the compass by which he steered and learned to chart the manners of a new land and life
BTS But you're not a man
BTS and walk off with it for a hundred yards
BTS Again I fell to chafing her hands and to moving her arms up and down and about until she could thrash them herself
BTS He has told me so and I cannot dissuade him
BTS There was no investigation no trial
BTS Colonel Ingram and Colonel Van Gilbert are two more familiar figures that I was later to encounter
BTS John Thornton and Buck looked at each other
BTS These footprints were very fresh
BTS With their fists alone they had no chance whatever
BTS The dividends are paid out of their blood
BTS Not for nothing had I been called Sissy Van Weyden I thought as I tossed restlessly on my bunk between one nightmare and another
BTS At the dark end of the first day we returned exhausted to our little cove towing the mainmast behind us
BTS We ran past our line of boats and bore down upon the first weather boat of the other line
BTS It manifested itself as a fear strong within her that made her prevent One Eye from more closely inspecting the cubs he had fathered
BTS Hump he said I beg pardon Mr
BTS He followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig
BTS It was impossible impossible
BTS On the other hand being a sheep-dog her instinctive fear of the Wild and especially of the wolf was unusually keen
BTS He was mastered by the sheer surging of life the tidal wave of being the perfect joy of each separate muscle joint and sinew in that it was everything that was not death that it was aglow and rampant expressing itself in movement flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move
BTS If it is sincere he amended
BTS He had covered the distance and gone in more like a cat than a dog
BTS its muscles were too much torn for that
BTS Sometimes however he dropped cautiously and slowly behind and edged in between the old leader and the she-wolf
BTS About what
BTS ' Oh well we've managed so far without it she said cheerfully
BTS But I came to work in the mills
BTS I had no proper basis
BTS While the Grangers expired in flame and blood and organized labor was disrupted the socialists held their peace and perfected their secret organization
BTS but I was appalled at the thought that Maud must die
BTS He had been out all night on the meat-trail and had but just then awakened
BTS There are seven boats aboard the captain's dingey and the six which the hunters will use
BTS In neither his father nor his mother was there any weakness nor in the generations before them
BTS He was fit that was all and unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life
BTS It was impossible to say no after that
BTS I too leaned upon the rail and gazed longingly into the sea with the certainty that sooner or later I should be sinking down down through the cool green depths of its oblivion
BTS Weedon Scott some one answered
BTS but as he will tell you himself he knows nothing about it
BTS His bondage had softened him
BTS White Fang still danced on dodging and doubling leaping in and out and ever inflicting damage
BTS Here was some thing not wood nor iron upon which to wreak his hate
BTS Besides this food he went on
BTS The working people were driven from their villages and herded in factory towns
BTS He paused a moment and I saw his white hands clinch
BTS But Johnson looking on still continued his grumbling
BTS From time to time they stole glances at Wolf Larsen and I could see that they were apprehensive of the man
BTS He knew it as a secret prompting as an urge of instinct of the same instinct that made him howl at the moon and stars of nights and that made him fear death and the unknown
BTS This meant me I thought and then the blankness and darkness rose over me
BTS The god remained quiet made no movement
BTS It is still obscure to me
BTS In the main so efficient a fighter had he become he went his way unscathed
BTS The bill was introduced on June 30 and not on July 30
BTS Pack up your kit and go for'ard into the fo'c'sle
BTS after that and only after that are their spirits ready for more refined nourishment
BTS It was what I may call the aristocratic ethic or the master ethic
BTS It was by strong effort only that I was able to maintain my old identity
BTS And I knew a score of happy complacent families that had received those dividends and by that much had profited by Jackson's blood
BTS But the Oligarchy was too confident in those days
BTS The intent of the snarl is to warn or frighten and judgment is required to know when it should be used
BTS She came closer and closer
BTS I am a revolutionist and it is a perilous vocation
BTS As in his puppyhood the looming bulks of the tepees man-reared had affected him as manifestations of power so was he affected now by the houses and the huge fort all of massive logs
BTS he had fought
BTS but I have been talking with Mr
BTS He went down past the blasted pine crossed the open space and trotted in amongst the trees
BTS But the blow did not fall
BTS I looked again but could not see them
BTS I asked
BTS They were fire-makers
BTS Ernest demanded
BTS Well I am going to exercise my prerogative of roaring and show you how fares nobility
BTS They looked upon him as legitimate prey and as legitimate prey he looked upon them
BTS I've got to live haven't I
BTS In his voice was kindness something of which White Fang had no experience whatever
BTS The wind was fair but fitful and it was like looking for a needle in a haystack to raise that tiny boat out of the blue immensity
BTS It beats me Mr
BTS I doubted that she had heard and I resolved to prevent her seeing the brutality I knew would follow the capture of the deserters
BTS The snow walls pressed him on every side and a great surge of fear swept through him the fear of the wild thing for the trap
BTS It was all muscle bone and sinew-fighting flesh in the finest condition
BTS The dogs never stopped
BTS As I passed between Harrison and the binnacle which was built into the top of the cabin I noticed that he was this time fully three points off
BTS I cried
BTS Among themselves a primitive barter began to spring up
BTS There were deeps in his nature which had never been sounded
BTS But profit-sharing as a system was ridiculous and impossible
BTS But the opportunity did not present itself and they pulled into Dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come
BTS His chance for election was most favorable
BTS Her father was a wolf
BTS I confess I wanted the coffee badly
BTS Thomas Mugridge popped out of his galley like a jack-in-the-box
BTS He waved his hand to include all of them turned to his own comrades and said Listen to the bellowing of the well-fed beasts
BTS he demanded back
BTS I saw his eyes flash golden as he spoke and I saw the terror mount in her own
BTS That is all the drunkenness of life the stirring and crawling of the yeast the babbling of the life that is insane with consciousness that it is alive
BTS White Fang looked on with a wondering eye
BTS Every night regularly at nine at twelve at three they lifted a nocturnal song a weird and eerie chant in which it was Buck's delight to join
BTS Thus we learned which building was held by our comrades and they did good work saving those in the street from the bombs of the enemy
BTS During the time that Kiche was tied by the stick he ran about over all the camp inquiring investigating learning
BTS Nor was I prompted to lie through fear
BTS Then she has my permission to cry out I said defiantly
BTS We encountered it well up to the forty-fourth parallel in a raw and stormy sea across which the wind harried the fog-banks in eternal flight
BTS Why should he not hate them
BTS I heard a great infuriated bellow go up from Wolf Larsen and from Leach a snarling that was desperate and blood-curdling
BTS It was just after the sun's futile effort to appear that Bill slipped the rifle from under the sled-lashings and said You keep right on Henry I'm goin' to see what I can see
BTS She appeared quite heart-broken over the discovery but recovered her spirits by coiling down tackles and halyards and all stray ropes
BTS They were a little frightened at this smooth-faced young fellow and the swing and smash of his words and his dreadful trait of calling a spade a spade
BTS How we socialists worked to hold them back
BTS What are you going to do
BTS He had caught the contagion of the excitement and he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for John Thornton
BTS In strange villages he had encountered the hands of the children and learned that they were cruel to hurt
BTS Her three suitors all bore the marks of her teeth
BTS His face strove to compose itself writhing and twisting in the effort till he broke down again
BTS But your strength is detachable
BTS We're sick of strikes
BTS At any moment he was liable to be snapped off the gaff but he was helpless with fright
BTS Years passed and in vain the Fighting Groups strove to execute their decree
BTS You have specialized
BTS I had never seen fear so strongly stamped upon a human face
BTS What of my impetus and the stunning surprise I clattered three or four steps along the deck before I could stop myself
BTS There had been his terrific headaches and we were agreed that it was some sort of brain break-down and that in his attacks he endured pain beyond our comprehension
BTS They were sounds not made by his mate and yet they were remotely familiar
BTS There was no longer anything to detain us on Endeavour Island
BTS And as you say it may tempt for good as well as for evil
BTS In consequence the men were sullen and vindictive
BTS Henry did not reply but munched on in silence until the meal finished he topped it with a final cup of coffee
BTS My head seemed bursting
BTS Van Weyden he interposed with mock anxiety
BTS Why had I brought the matter up
BTS until to be our original selves would require a watchful and strong exercise of will
BTS As there were nine boats all told it meant that we should have plenty of water and ballast as well though there was the chance that the boat would be overloaded what of the generous supply of other things I was taking
BTS Joe was sourer than ever and Sol-leks was unapproachable blind side or other side
BTS Here was mastery and power something far and away beyond him
BTS I lived through three days of the Chicago Commune and the vastness of it and of the slaughter may be imagined when I say that in all that time I saw practically nothing outside the killing of the people of the abyss and the mid-air fighting between sky-scrapers
BTS But no master came
BTS It seemed incredible that the next surge should not crush the Ghost down upon the tiny eggshell
BTS A bright thought struck me
BTS Well them wolves is land sharks
BTS His little body rounded out with the meat he now ate
BTS His nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the life on the heels of which he was travelling
BTS So we have preached power
BTS but behind him were the shades of all manner of dogs half-wolves and wild wolves urgent and prompting tasting the savor of the meat he ate thirsting for the water he drank scenting the wind with him listening with him and telling him the sounds made by the wild life in the forest dictating his moods directing his actions lying down to sleep with him when he lay down and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff of his dreams
BTS Time and again and countless times we watched the boat luff into the big whitecaps lose headway and be flung back like a cork
BTS There won't be any more strikes
BTS In vain the Grangers pleaded with us
BTS So saying he turned and walked quietly forward
BTS I nearly met you once in Philadelphia some Browning affair or other you were to lecture you know
BTS Then I've got you
BTS I begged her with my eyes to go below but she smiled and said We may be feeble land-creatures without legs but we can show Captain Larsen that we are at least as brave as he
BTS The primitive deeps of my nature stirred
BTS Old Mother Nature's going to get up on her hind legs and howl for all that's in her and it'll keep us jumping Hump to pull through with half our boats
BTS In this instance I could not see but I could hear the impact of the blows the soft crushing sound made by flesh striking forcibly against flesh
BTS He was a sneak and a thief a mischief-maker a fomenter of trouble
BTS somebody comin' our way he was saying
BTS But upon me had devolved the task of tending their wounds and pulling them through and I did my best by them
BTS And then taking no further account of me he turned his back and went up on deck
BTS And then there was the Bishop
BTS I wanted to know why things were and how they came to pass
BTS Prevented from obtaining his share of meat and fish when a general feed was given to the camp-dogs he became a clever thief
BTS For no other reason did Hurlbert die under torture refusing to the last to betray his comrades
BTS was his opening salutation
BTS Pandemonium broke out again
BTS That's the only reason
BTS They were all terribly footsore
BTS It seemed a mite top-heavy
BTS Consciousness was blotted out by the darkness he had so graphically described and when I came to myself I was lying on the floor and he was smoking a cigar and regarding me thoughtfully with that old familiar light of curiosity in his eyes
BTS One day they openly sicked the dogs on him
BTS He took to standing for long periods with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply
BTS and if they have never done this before still I can do it
BTS There's them that can't sail with better men like the hunters and them that don't know like the poor devils of wind-jammers for'ard there
BTS White Fang grew stronger heavier and more compact while his character was developing along the lines laid down by his heredity and his environment
BTS You're right Matt
BTS His driver lingered a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind
BTS Oilskins and sea-boots were hanging from the walls and here and there rifles and shotguns rested securely in the racks
BTS He did both
BTS The sailor Johnson was swayed by idea by principle and truth and sincerity
BTS I have heard you grow eloquent over the brave trade-wind
BTS White Fang knew this point
BTS Neither buying nor selling they had no money and in the end their land was sold to pay the taxes
BTS The hawk had eaten the ptarmigan-mother
BTS Men were weak I say and because of their weakness we were compelled to make the only other reward that was within our power
BTS Eat them up
BTS He shook his head and with a deep sign as of awakening caught his breath
BTS The soldier chuckled and the automobile sped on
BTS He had found the lines which held them and cast them adrift
BTS But our own nascent secret service was beginning to work
BTS Van Weyden he said
BTS It was a rookery which had never been raided by the hunters and in consequence the seals were mild-tempered and at the same time unafraid
BTS Of all men it was now the property of Mr
BTS Let go that foreboom tackle and pass it across and when she's willing let go the sheet and come in snug with the tackle
BTS A few minutes later the remainder of the tribe strung out as it was on the march trailed in
BTS Well I got him first Donnelly said with pride
BTS This was repeated a number of times
BTS But the space on deck where I had left him lying was vacant
BTS It was utterly unexpected and it was over and done with between the ticks of two seconds
BTS They met him with the mass-formation otherwise he would have killed them one by one in a night
BTS The nightmare city was gone
BTS In truth there was very little reasoning or none at all
BTS We must do something
BTS As the moose were coming into the land other kinds of life were coming in
BTS He eluded their fangs
BTS The quiet water had become suddenly angry
BTS his face glowed his eyes snapped and flashed and his chin and jaw were eloquent with aggressiveness
BTS I almost wish we'd sunk him the little rip
BTS And Jim Hall on the other hand did not know that Judge Scott was merely ignorant
BTS It grew more nervous and excited every moment
BTS You know nothing and worse than nothing about the working class
BTS Though it's little faith I'm having John that the beast can do the trick
BTS She moved toward him a few steps playfully and then halted
BTS I was frightened when I became conscious that I was seeing red and the thought flashed through my mind was I too becoming tainted by the brutality of my environment
BTS Now he could expect a beating as fearful as any he had received from Beauty Smith
BTS Mr
BTS He sipped his tea and smiled at me while I ran over the pages
BTS John Thornton was sitting near the edge Buck at his shoulder
BTS 'Twas after that I joined the Reds
BTS It is so quiet and peaceful and I sit here and ponder and am restless
BTS In some way the third finger had been crushed to a pulp
BTS Perrault was in a hurry and he prided himself on his knowledge of ice which knowledge was indispensable for the fall ice was very thin and where there was swift water there was no ice at all
BTS He did not wait
BTS Watch
BTS She was crouching as he had crouched once that day in front of her the tight-rolled ball of quills
BTS Nor will you be able to take pleasure in sackcloth he said gravely
BTS But when I came to make the bed I found between the blankets dropped apparently as he had sunk off to sleep a complete Browning the Cambridge Edition
BTS They were leaping straight for him and the Factor
BTS Why we could sail away in her
BTS The Speaker rapped for order and glanced expectantly at the officers in the doorways
BTS It had been my intention to have her meals served apart but Wolf Larsen put down his foot
BTS Stands pretty close to two feet an' a half at the shoulders Henry commented
BTS No matches I groaned
BTS Oh don't mind me he said with a self-depreciatory wave of his hand
BTS but the wreck was securely lashed for it could be patched and made whole again
BTS Several months later we rode him on one of his father's horses over Sonoma Mountains to Petaluma Creek and embarked him in a small fishing-launch
BTS Hal was a youngster of nineteen or twenty with a big Colt's revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges
BTS They were not half living or quarter living
BTS And then the next moment Pardon my sneer Bishop
BTS Here take a drink of this
BTS this air does give one an appetite
BTS It was surely dead
BTS but I felt a sinking at the heart and seemed to divine the presence of bleached bones somewhere on that beach
BTS The seals had started on their great southern migration and the rookery was practically deserted
BTS As for myself I found it most enjoyable
BTS Good Lord do you think you're travelling on a Pullman
BTS Pack up and go for'ard
BTS His lost eye and his scarred muzzle bore evidence to the nature of his experience
BTS There must be some less brutal way
BTS A strong young man he said
BTS You've got all you wanted out of me
BTS Ernest considered this announcement for a moment and then said and his face was very grave withal there was a sombre wrath in it There is more behind this than a mere university ideal
BTS One day they had grub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left Dawson for the head-waters of the Tanana the men and dogs were sitting on the crest of a cliff which fell away straight down to naked bed-rock three hundred feet below
BTS It was what might be termed a sinewy knotty strength of the kind we ascribe to lean and wiry men but which in him because of his heavy build partook more of the enlarged gorilla order
BTS Take off your shoes that's right and carry them in your hand
BTS but as the men continued to pull lustily they struck closer and closer
BTS I would work my will through it all in spite of Wolf Larsen and of my own thirty-five bookish years
BTS He was ranging at the head of the pack running the wild thing down the living meat to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood
BTS Not for nothing had he been exposed to the pitiless struggles for life in the day of his cubhood when his mother and he alone and unaided held their own and survived in the ferocious environment of the Wild
BTS He is certainly an individualist of the most pronounced type
BTS The workingmen on the street railway furnish the labor
BTS So on this great journey into the East straight meat was the bill of fare ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless future
BTS Your point of view she laughed
BTS There you go Ernest laughed
BTS You remember I told you last night the barometer was falling
BTS No need to go to any great trouble for me she protested when I had seated her in Wolf Larsen's arm-chair which I had dragged hastily from his cabin
BTS He caught sight of White Fang and terror rushed into his face
BTS She had made no noise whatever had not even moved
BTS But this circle had a continuous tendency to draw in upon him
BTS There was driftwood though not much on the beach and the sight of a coffee tin I had taken from the Ghost's larder had given me the idea of a fire
BTS I threw open the door
BTS Thus it was with the two children
BTS Germany Italy France Australia and New Zealand were busy forming cooperative commonwealths
BTS It was not until the Second Revolt was crushed that the 'Frisco Reds flourished again
BTS Thomas Mugridge crawled weakly across the galley floor and a short lurch of the Ghost sent him staggering
BTS He growled and tried to push by them
BTS That is the paradox of it he countered
BTS Whet whet whet Humphrey Van Weyden sharpening his knife in a ship's galley and trying its edge with his thumb
BTS Van Weyden good-night
BTS But whatever he does he does because he desires to do it
BTS The old primal melancholy was strong upon him
BTS Nothing happened though the adjacent portions of the tepee moved
BTS I scanned the sea with my glasses
BTS and where it was not striking it was being turned out by the capitalists
BTS He had learned another lesson of his bondage
BTS There must be a station somewhere and men
BTS For some time the two men amused themselves with watching the movement of vague forms on the edge of the firelight
BTS He was not used to fighting with that kind of dog and he was waiting for them to bring on the real dog
BTS he smashed Beauty Smith over backward with a second blow in the face
BTS There was a long pause and every man at the table meditated in ways unwonted and profound
BTS The enormousness of it appalled him
BTS But that did not loosen the jaws
BTS I failed to recognize him but before I could speak I trod upon something that was alive and that squirmed under my foot
BTS I'm a foreman if you please
BTS Great God
BTS Charles looked on wistfully wiped his watery eyes but did not get up because of his stiffness
BTS Judge Scott still held to the same opinion and proved it to everybody's dissatisfaction by measurements and descriptions taken from the encyclopaedia and various works on natural history
BTS The way was clear
BTS How does he do it
BTS A bell-buoy and we're a-top of it
BTS They wanted something to happen
BTS Then I had no right to kick 'm
BTS Yes I mean just that I replied
BTS Concern showed in their faces and I noticed a tightening of lips
BTS and the halyards running through various blocks on the gaff and mast gave him separate holds for hands and feet
BTS He crawled the several steps toward the flame
BTS The hope for the Ghost lay in that she should pass that point before the Macedonia arrived at it
BTS There was a magic in words greater than the conjurer's art
BTS better for that he said
BTS And though there was no reason in his brain for a clear conception of so abstract a thing as justice nevertheless in his own way he felt the justice of the man-animals and he knew them for what they were makers of law and executors of law
BTS Grey Beaver clouted him right and left to make him get up and follow
BTS he knew only that he must submit to the will of this new master obey his every whim and fancy
BTS Between them they ran him about for the better part of an hour
BTS If you were really great really true to yourself you would join forces with Leach and Johnson
BTS Each time that she reappeared was a miracle
BTS It is true he worked with it
BTS It meant merely more work to find them and tow them back
BTS From beneath their feet rose always the subterranean rumbles of revolt
BTS but he's my sailor when I have him aboard and I'll do what I damn well please with him
BTS But when the descending foot missed the solid flooring and felt vacancy beneath it was the old Wolf Larsen and the tiger muscles that made the falling body spring across the opening even as it fell so that he struck on his chest and stomach with arms outstretched on the floor of the opposite side
BTS He had learned his lesson well--too well
BTS The shot missed and the next moment I was screaming and motioning the signals
BTS I crouched and listened
BTS Your flesh is not afraid
BTS And sometimes the young leader on the left whirled too
BTS You see the man from Missouri always says 'You've got to show me
BTS Weedon telegraph at once to San Francisco for Doctor Nichols
BTS Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment
BTS His voice was soft and soothing
BTS but still no further away no endlessness of life
BTS Chance travellers might praise or pet him
BTS There is a large likelihood of internal injuries
BTS I asked
BTS Francois followed him up whereupon he again retreated
BTS but that is no reason that I should not try to be shattered as little as possible
BTS He flung it back so that it struck the sled and bounced along until it fetched up on Bill's snowshoes
BTS On the other hand the labor castes the members of the favored unions will strive to make their organizations into close corporations
BTS He looked over the remainder of the team with a speculative eye that summed up instantly the salient traits of each animal
BTS Francois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back still one leap ahead gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that Francois would save him
BTS nor did he attempt to charge in when Sol-leks was once more brought forward
BTS She put her hand sympathetically on mine and said You will have to begin over again
BTS Lip-lip might face the pack but he could not face that whip and all that was left him to do was to keep his long rope taut and his flanks ahead of the teeth of his mates
BTS I thought so
BTS I demanded
BTS His chief contribution to science was his studies of the electron and his monumental work on the Identification of Matter and Energy wherein he established beyond cavil and for all time that the ultimate unit of matter and the ultimate unit of force were identical
BTS You never knew wot it was to go 'ungry to cry yerself asleep with yer little belly gnawin' an' gnawin' like a rat inside yer
BTS So I shall expect after breakfast to receive my first lesson
BTS His resignation was demanded that was all
BTS He watched the door for his antagonist to enter
BTS Our men clustering amidships waved their hats and raised a derisive cheer
BTS Yet in accordance with Ernest's test of truth it worked
BTS The door to his state-room was closed
BTS It's uncanny Pete said after it was over and they had caught their speech
BTS He came to the surface and the sweet air rushed into his open mouth
BTS The jib was rising
BTS Trotting along in his silent way to investigate a new tepee which had been erected on the edge of the village while he was away with the hunters after moose he came full upon Kiche
BTS The fierce winter had now descended upon us
BTS He had to become all these things else he would not have held his own nor survive the hostile environment in which he found himself
BTS and by the time this part of my task was accomplished the Ghost was leaping into the south-west the wind on her quarter and all her sheets to starboard
BTS White Fang was bitter and implacable
BTS Their sacks were slim and with his own the three partners could rake together only two hundred dollars
BTS White Fang had learned to turn suddenly upon the pursuer that was ahead of the pack and thoroughly to rip him up before the pack could arrive
BTS All the fighting blood of his breed was up in him and surging through him
BTS That is why you cannot compete with them
BTS You might help me she smiled
BTS It was sultry and oppressive reminding me of what the old Californians term earthquake weather
BTS His soft snarl grew tense and harsh
BTS England managed to crush her own proletarian revolution and to hold on to India though she was brought to the verge of exhaustion
BTS Perhaps they were the last he did utter too
BTS In your recent encounters you failed to shake the masters
BTS And at the end of three days I had a windlass which worked clumsily
BTS I took six fish out of the bag
BTS I know the kind
BTS He fought by instinct but he could fight by head as well
BTS Everybody stole property from everybody else
BTS Can you lend me a thousand
BTS It would have been far better if you had Ernest said gravely
BTS In point of fact the three actions of perceiving determining and responding were sequential
BTS This rush ceased abruptly
BTS As Francois's whip backed him up Buck found it to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate
BTS Pools of stagnant water stood around the house their surfaces covered with a green and putrid-looking scum while the stench that arose from them was intolerable
BTS But before I could guess what he had comprehended he had dropped the trap-door into place closing the lazarette
BTS He rained upon it curses from God and High Heaven and withered it with a heat of invective that savoured of a mediaeval excommunication of the Catholic Church
BTS Another whisper of wind and another passed by
BTS One hand was clutched tightly against his chest by the other hand and blood dripped down upon the floor as he walked
BTS The pain was too great
BTS He would die for the right if needs be he would be true to himself sincere with his soul
BTS Then they became friendly and played about in the nervous half-coy way with which fierce beasts belie their fierceness
BTS As he phrased it the wires were like the stock market now up now down
BTS He struck after his custom without warning
BTS One day three dogs were turned in upon him in succession
BTS If only he knew how many revolutionists his horses have carried
BTS The function of the corporation lawyer was to serve by corrupt methods the money-grabbing propensities of the corporations
BTS she exclaimed
BTS Beauty Smith entered club in hand and took the chain off from White Fang's neck
BTS He spoke out of a superconscious apprehension of them
BTS Whom
BTS Furthermore it was remarkably easy to overthrow a dog taken by surprise
BTS This had been strong upon him when he pulled in to the bank and it had not departed from him
BTS The air was vibrant with things happening and impending
BTS It was scrawled over with geometrical diagrams and calculations of some sort
BTS The result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel
BTS No hard surface collided with the tender little nose he thrust out tentatively before him
BTS They have become members of those unions through competition for place
BTS There was imperative need to adjust myself to consider the significance of the changed aspect of things
BTS After the first two or three strange dogs had been downed and destroyed the white men hustled their own animals back on board and wrecked savage vengeance on the offenders
BTS If the cheated Grangers became violent all was lost
BTS She beamed upon him through her terror-filled eyes and the pathos of it cut me to the heart
BTS All right Thomas I said
BTS It was unprecedented
BTS It is true that labor has from the beginning of history been in the dirt
BTS Whenever he ventured away from his mother the bully was sure to appear trailing at his heels snarling at him picking upon him and watchful of an opportunity when no man-animal was near to spring upon him and force a fight
BTS When they saw him they rushed for him
BTS But I did get something out of his Data of Ethics
BTS Not a wheel moved in his empire
BTS For other men new in the land they felt nothing but disdain
BTS So what was the good to write
BTS he burst out at me with renewed rage
BTS Pardon me
BTS The expropriated farmers took forcible possession of the state governments
BTS We sailed with a beam wind along the shore searching the coves with our glasses and landing occasionally without finding a sign of human life
BTS How old are you
BTS and it would like to go in and eat them if it dared
BTS The geese
BTS Sick 'm Cherokee
BTS What are you going to do
BTS Better sling yer 'ook out of 'ere Yonson he said
BTS Buck multiplied himself attacking from all sides enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace cutting out his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates wearing out the patience of creatures preyed upon which is a lesser patience than that of creatures preying
BTS An hour later taking advantage of the cut-offs around which the sled had to go Bill arrived
BTS He on the other hand learned that it was not necessary to use his teeth upon them
BTS his intelligence shepherd intelligence and St
BTS All Endeavour Island brightened under the sun
BTS I sometimes thought my mind would give way under it a meet thing on this ship of madmen and brutes
BTS The Bishop bowed and gave me precedence
BTS We were now dead before the wind the boat far away and abreast of us
BTS The people knelt upon the ground with awe
BTS Originally they were private detectives
BTS What can I do for you
BTS and when we braced ourselves automatically for these various expected movements their non-occurrence quite overcame our equilibrium
BTS CHAPTER II THE SOUTHLAND White Fang landed from the steamer in San Francisco
BTS The man laughed at this
BTS As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though Buck's hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest
BTS This he received without perturbation though he obeyed it by keeping his distance
BTS I am sure that he can present things from a new point of view that will be interesting and refreshing
BTS We knew not what to expect of him next what fearful thing rising above the flesh he might break out and do
BTS You have been very wordy and all you have done is buzz
BTS Francois was obdurate but when he turned his back Buck again displaced Sol-leks who was not at all unwilling to go
BTS I'll write to you about him
BTS No girl could live in a university town till she was twenty-four and not have love experiences
BTS The different lines were rapidly approaching a point
BTS The faro-dealer stooped down obediently and got a firm hold on Cherokee
BTS In his nostrils was the smell of the camp-smoke
BTS He would most probably shoot you
BTS On the other hand there is evidence to show that the Iron Heel was responsible for the act
BTS He was no figure-head
BTS You just bet I did was the fervent reply
BTS in his address at Harvard Commencement We all know that as things actually are many of the most influential and most highly remunerated members of the Bar in every centre of wealth make it their special task to work out bold and ingenious schemes by which their wealthy clients individual or corporate can evade the laws which were made to regulate in the interests of the public the uses of great wealth
BTS Only way to find out is to find out
BTS He received the word as if it had a familiar ring though he pondered it thoughtfully
BTS Couldn't 've seen 'm for smoke
BTS Mugridge' sez 'e to me Mugridge' sez 'e you've missed yer vokytion
BTS This instead of being a danger was an added security
BTS The eyes and it was my destiny to know them well were large and handsome wide apart as the true artist's are wide sheltering under a heavy brow and arched over by thick black eyebrows
BTS Think not that you will escape being penalized
BTS At last after what seemed centuries unable longer to stand the strain I looked around
BTS The hired foreign palace guards of Louis XVI a king of France that was beheaded by his people
BTS What desires
BTS If you only knew
BTS It was unusually cruel-looking and at first I had shuddered every time I used it
BTS days of calm when we floated on the lonely immensity of sea oppressed by its greatness and yet marvelling at the miracle of tiny life for we still lived and struggled to live
BTS But he rolled into my marmalade and underclothes and against the trap-door
BTS He did not know what to say
BTS Beside him even the venerable head of the university looked tawdry and small
BTS It was old country to me that I knew and loved and soon I became the guide
BTS As usual the watches below and the hunters turned out for what promised sport
BTS O 'e was a sight I can tell yer
BTS Look here the hunter Standish spoke to Wolf Larsen that's my boat-puller and I don't want to lose him
BTS But one day the master sprang from the carriage whip in hand and gave the stone-throwers a thrashing
BTS What has happened
BTS but now and again appearing and disappearing amongst the underbrush and the scattered clumps of spruce could be seen One Ear
BTS no
BTS It just happened
BTS he cried when his eyes lit upon Buck
BTS On a large transparent sheet compass and square in hand he was copying what appeared to be a scale of some sort or other
BTS Hammerfield retorted tartly
BTS It was during this period between the death of Johansen and the arrival on the sealing grounds that I passed my pleasantest hours on the Ghost
BTS But that is beside the matter I cried
BTS We can feel them
BTS Then the calf of his leg was badly lacerated and looked as though it had been mangled by a bulldog
BTS I had seen a distant headland past the extreme edge of the promontory and as we looked we could see grow the intervening coastline of what was evidently a deep cove
BTS Tim Keenan gave a final shove forward and stepped back again
BTS It was the forerunner of the snarl and I was to hear it many times that night--the token of the brute in man the earnest of his primitive passions
BTS The god merely held near to his nose a piece of meat
BTS Beauty Smith had estimated his powers well for he was invariably the victor
BTS Van Weyden he said to me when he had been relieved from the wheel we must make these new-comers welcome
BTS How about your own policy
BTS The annals of this short-lived era of despair make bloody reading
BTS Or at least White Fang thought he was deserted until he smelled out the master's canvas clothes-bags alongside of him and proceeded to mount guard over them
BTS You impeach my sober judgment and make my canons of little worth
BTS Beauty Smith did not jump away
BTS The mills were working overtime
BTS I feared nothing
BTS Soon we were in the green country and I took one last glance back at the smoke-filled sky
BTS I shot a glance at the woman but she was leaning back in the arm-chair her eyes closed unutterably tired
BTS and when with a final rub and scratch the man left him alone and went away all fear had died out of White Fang
BTS Still their strength went down
BTS Mr
BTS But had she seen the clamour in them and understood
BTS Yes and only one hundred and forty miles if it continues for three days and nights
BTS But I saw not the deck but where the deck should have been for it was buried beneath a wild tumbling of water
BTS Are you sick
BTS Next came official orders
BTS As usual the Oligarchy will believe it has done right
BTS Though the novelty had not yet worn off the peaceful comportment of the seals had quieted my alarm
BTS His small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light while he roared with fury at sight of Buck
BTS I asked
BTS He glanced from face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it going again
BTS You spend what you haven't got and in return you get greater value from spending what you haven't got than I get from spending what I have got and what I have sweated to get
BTS He felt it as did the other dogs and knew that a change was at hand
BTS He had managed to get the muzzle in between the jaws on one side and was trying to get it out between the jaws on the other side
BTS I glanced at father and I was afraid he was going to giggle at the effect of this human bombshell he had been guilty of launching amongst us
BTS I could hoist no more
BTS Formerly White Fang had been merely the enemy of his kind withal a ferocious enemy
BTS I'll be good she said as a naughty child might say it
BTS We've smashed the water supply Hartman cried excitedly to me
BTS He held on as if he were a precious thing a treasure beyond diamonds or rubies
BTS Then between them the she-wolf and One Eye devoured the game which the mysterious sapling had caught for them
BTS This group of madmen met frequently and passed wholesale judgments upon offending members and servitors of the Oligarchy
BTS Then you read consciousness
BTS Already the passport system modelled on the Russian was developing
BTS this exultation of life
BTS Yours is to do your own work and to have Cooky stand by the fore-sheet
BTS He remarked the pregnant silence of the forest
BTS Never had Mrs
BTS but my heart was aching for the youth of him and I felt that I must either scream or burst into tears
BTS The railroads controlling rates and the bankers and stock exchange gamesters controlling prices had long since bled the farmers into indebtedness
BTS The rest of the dogs were in like condition
BTS They declaimed about famine and pestilence as being scourges of God while the scientists were building granaries and draining cities
BTS Upon his inward sight was impressed a succession of memory-pictures
BTS Not only did it use its own vast power but it used all the power of the United States Treasury to carry out its plans
BTS It's a she-wolf Henry whispered back an' that accounts for Fatty an' Frog
BTS Did you hear Mr
BTS The cub felt the prod of the life that was in him and stood up and snarled valiantly by his mother's side
BTS The sun was returning
BTS And there was a subconscious resentment that these his kind at first sight had pitched upon him and tried to destroy him
BTS Remove the ulcer was his remedy
BTS Their business was to toil and toil mightily in the traces
BTS They saw only the effects and the effects were bad
BTS He was wise
BTS On the sidewalk they were liable to have their skulls crushed by bricks and cobblestones thrown from windows and house-tops
BTS He was sitting on the side of his bunk the whole pose of his figure indicating utter dejection and hopelessness
BTS As for the dozen men who were clamoring for the floor half of them began speaking at once
BTS The next moment she was in my arms weeping convulsively on my shoulder while I clasped her close
BTS and Proletariat class 20393137
BTS In point of fact the chief vent to this primal melancholy has been religion in its more agonizing forms
BTS The sacredness of life I had accepted as axiomatic
BTS His forgotten cubhood all that was associated with that familiar snarl rushed back to him
BTS They should work hand in hand and to their mutual benefit
BTS Oh the blessed sun
BTS You have spoken much truth Mr
BTS In the coal- mining regions the employment of children was notorious
BTS As for the rest the wages of those who were loyal were unceasing peril torture and death
BTS Our organization went on apace and there were mountains of work always waiting to be done
BTS And White Fang licked his hurts and meditated upon this his first taste of pack-cruelty and his introduction to the pack
BTS It would be all up he answered
BTS half an inch
BTS Also the great machinist strike had been broken
BTS But with nothing eternal before me but death given for a brief spell this yeasty crawling and squirming which is called life why it would be immoral for me to perform any act that was a sacrifice
BTS They had voiced a kindred intellect and spirit and as such I had received them into a camaraderie of the mind
BTS Matt commented
BTS Something must be done must be done
BTS Is it far
BTS They were machine-serfs and labor-serfs
BTS He pulled when he could
BTS It was the defiant cry of a mighty spirit
BTS It's nasty weather like this here that turns heads grey before their time he said with a nod toward the pilot-house
BTS But they displayed little difference from the wolf when they discovered the cub and his mother
BTS I was angry with myself for being caught in so cowardly a position crouching on the floor
BTS You forget the boat we found on the beach I reminded her
BTS he demanded
BTS It's all right about the dogs but we must draw the line somewhere
BTS Have you tried to get word to Chicago
BTS Wickson was imperturbable
BTS They sound a note of warning
BTS Yet so thoroughly had he prepared for the revolt that his fellow-conspirators were able with little confusion or delay to carry out his plans
BTS and repeated a dream
BTS What else could that expression have meant that dancing tremulous light and a something more which words could not describe
BTS His intention was to rest Dave letting him run free behind the sled
BTS I forget my own life in the love of another life
BTS Asmunsen replied
BTS Not guilty he answered
BTS I'm jes' plump tuckered out
BTS This accomplished he had little trouble with them
BTS The I
BTS Py Jingo
BTS Before he had known the gods she had been to him the centre-pin of the universe
BTS Bleeding and coughing already stricken he sprang at the elder and fought while life faded from him his legs going weak beneath him the light of day dulling on his eyes his blows and springs falling shorter and shorter
BTS In the meantime the abysmal brute in Beauty Smith had been rising into his brain and mastering the small bit of sanity that he possessed at best
BTS And human life is in no wise different though you feel it is and think that you reason why it is
BTS but the strange dog no matter what the breed or valor swiftly acknowledged Buck's supremacy or found himself struggling for life with a terrible antagonist
BTS and in the wall itself shored by strong timbers well drained and ventilated we excavated two small rooms
BTS But if they could fast prodigiously they could feed prodigiously and soon a few scattered bones were all that remained of the splendid live brute that had faced the pack a few hours before
BTS Not that he was abashed
BTS but she had other troubles
BTS On the scale I've worked out the circles of altitude and the lines of bearing
BTS I had seen the frightful treatment of the cabin-boy and knew that I should very probably receive the same if not worse
BTS And as for my dreaming-- he put his hand in his pocket and drew out a small pamphlet--tell me if this looks like dream-stuff
BTS But the trusts themselves arose out of competition Mr
BTS The hunters had packed their belongings with similar haste
BTS The wear and tear of spring storms and melting snows had underwashed the bank and in one place had made a small cave out of a narrow fissure
BTS I had never met a man like him
BTS There is plenty more life demanding to be born
BTS Hereafter you shall stand watches receive seventy-five dollars per month and be addressed fore and aft as Mr
BTS We do get justice
BTS The gong clanged and knelled
BTS Her sharp menacing cry sent the hair bristling along his back and he snarled warningly at her
BTS also that he was a remittance man and was paid to keep away from England p'yed 'ansomely sir was the way he put it
BTS Because of his very great love he could not steal from this man but from any other man in any other camp he did not hesitate an instant
BTS In the favored unions are the flower of the American workingmen
BTS so it devolved upon me to learn and learn quickly
BTS He's my boat-puller
BTS He ceased speaking
BTS The sound of his voice made Maud quickly draw close to me as for protection and she rested one hand on my arm while we parleyed
BTS Mine is the role of the weak
BTS Prisons banishment and degradation honors and palaces and wonder-cities are all incidental
BTS The great tea-pot was still in my hand
BTS '  An' 'ow's that
BTS Something unusual was happening
BTS The sails did require some cutting and the canvas heavy with water tried my strength severely
BTS They raged and slaughtered and destroyed all over the city proper and were in turn destroyed
BTS For as many of itself as were killed it killed that many of the enemy
BTS He rested for two days and then ventured forth from the cave again
BTS Food and fire protection and companionship were some of the things he received from the god
BTS Mush on poor sore feets the driver encouraged them as they tottered down the main street of Skaguay
BTS but in a short time the master capitalists found it cheaper to own the political machines themselves and to hire the machine bosses
BTS And the sleuth-hounds of the law the paid fighting animals of society with telephone and telegraph and special train clung to his trail night and day
BTS He snapped his fingers contemptuously and proceeded to sit down
BTS What visitant from the gloom of the deep was I to behold
BTS A man's got his rights
BTS Then they gave up letting the boat drift till a second boat sent from the shore by Wolf Larsen took them in tow and brought them aboard
BTS The cub saw little of the battle
BTS He was led into the inner cave-room and one of the young comrades left to guard him while we discussed the situation in the kitchen
BTS I demanded
BTS My function is to amuse and so long as I amuse all goes well
BTS yet I could not escape smiling at Garthwaite who was rolling a cigarette and saying I know I'm making a mess of rescuing you but I can't get head nor tail of the situation
BTS Henry was bending over and adding ice to the babbling pot of beans when he was startled by the sound of a blow an exclamation from Bill and a sharp snarling cry of pain from among the dogs
BTS This man this captain is a brute a demon and one can never tell what will be his next fantastic act
BTS I dropped my arm for a moment and a moment only
BTS Nothing was happening where we were
BTS Then there were the pebbles and stones that turned under him when he trod upon them
BTS Do be merciful
BTS what of the destruction of the farmers and the middle class
BTS In his insistent crawling toward the light he discovered in her a nose that with a sharp nudge administered rebuke and later a paw that crushed him down and rolled him over and over with swift calculating stroke
BTS White Fang looked up at the fort at the same time bristling and growling
BTS Truly Humphrey Van Weyden was at last in love I thought as her fingers clung to mine while I lowered her down to the boat
BTS The unknown lurking in the midst of the sticks and moss was savagely clutching him by the nose
BTS It is almost laughable now when I look back on it the way father was beaten
BTS I could see a black fin cutting the water and making for him with greater swiftness than he was being pulled aboard
BTS His head must iv smashed like an eggshell
BTS Socialism has no more to do with the state of nature than has differential calculus with a Bible class
BTS He can only wrong himself
BTS They are precious
BTS There is a good example of it in this evening's paper
BTS And he was merciless
BTS And on this count you cannot answer me here to-night face to face any more than can your whole class answer the million and a half of revolutionists in the United States
BTS yet they laid it unhesitatingly against Matthewson's six hundred
BTS I came into his stormy life not as a new perturbing force but as one that made toward peace and repose
BTS I nodded my head but said We'll all win back to San Francisco Leach and you'll be with me when I go to see Matt McCarthy
BTS The Preacher found life and the works of life all a vanity and vexation an evil thing
BTS You ketch um dog were Beauty Smith's words to Grey Beaver
BTS He did not waste any time
BTS He laughed shrewdly
BTS He stopped at the break of the poop and called me to him
BTS Not a line not a thought that he uttered
BTS It is not strange Salmon Tongue Grey Beaver answered
BTS Power you have proclaimed the king of words
BTS This was the man that looked at White Fang delighted in his ferocious prowess and desired to possess him
BTS The City of Tokio from 'Frisco bound for Yokohama
BTS We'll have the breeze on our quarter he explained to me
BTS Ernest paused for a moment and regarded him thoughtfully noting his face dark and twisted with anger his panting chest his writhing body and his slim white hands nervously clenching and unclenching
BTS Then there were cats and rabbits and turkeys
BTS Yes she said but now it no longer shackles him
BTS The deposits average more than one hundred millions a day
BTS The fight had opened at long distance and the rifles were cracking steadily
BTS It was not for me this greatest thing in the world I had decided
BTS But that is equivalent to one hundred and forty-four miles in twenty-four hours I added reassuringly
BTS The strain was too great
BTS But this failure to get possession was not the chief danger that Ernest had in mind
BTS And always he demanded facts and refused to discuss theories
BTS Then rested refreshed and strong he turned his face toward camp and John Thornton
BTS The cook drew himself up in a smugly humble fashion a deprecating smirk on his face
BTS Again the rope was attached and he was launched and again he struck out but this time straight into the stream
BTS The eighteen months that followed was perhaps the happiest of my life with Ernest
BTS Van Weyden Wolf Larsen said the following morning at the breakfast-table How do things look
BTS Ah now you are up in the air again Ernest remarked dryly
BTS And then just as suddenly like the sun rising on a stormy sea they would begin to laugh
BTS And there on the deck was a single stick of timber to show for a whole morning's work
BTS We'll trust our lives to it
BTS but if you throw your fortunes in with the working class--well watch out for your face that is all
BTS Hammerfield had been nearly killed in the Great Earthquake by a falling chimney
BTS I learned shorthand and typewriting and became his secretary
BTS He was very angry and was cursing the whole secret service
BTS her lashed wheel creaked as the rudder kicked
BTS Beauty Smith gave him a beating
BTS The fire died down and the gleaming eyes drew closer the circle they had flung about the camp
BTS Ernest's blood was up
BTS Hump I have studied some grammar in my time and I think your tenses are tangled
BTS I rowed a couple of hundred feet along the beach so as to recover my nerves and then stepped ashore again
BTS She turned her head and beheld the sight
BTS He gave a short laugh
BTS A revulsion of feeling came over me
BTS Then his weakness asserted itself and he lay down his ears cocked his head on one side as he watched the puppy
BTS And that was the last of Francois and Perrault
BTS I saw more of Wolf Larsen than ever when we had gained the grounds
BTS Give 'm a fair chance an' if he don't deliver the goods I'll kill 'm myself
BTS He had forgotten how to shift for himself
BTS Several things favored him in this
BTS Almost before I knew it and without one serious hitch I had the mainmast stepped
BTS One of the puppies sprawled up to White Fang
BTS And it is well
BTS And was I too one of his swine
BTS He knew more about fighting than did any of the dogs that faced him
BTS There is no congeniality between him and the rest of the men aboard ship
BTS But you go to those books to learn
BTS We should be on the rocks first
BTS for a living dog is better than a dead lion
BTS He feels it is his bounden duty to resurrect the ancient spirit of the Church and to deliver its message to the masters
BTS Never mind father
BTS There is room for argument there Wickson muttered
BTS But in the galley though a fire was burning and water boiling I found no Maud
BTS Not only was she overthrown
BTS Carlson afterward reported several blisters and much grievous loss of skin due to the smallness of the shoes but he succeeded in doing gallant work with them
BTS He had given himself to Grey Beaver and to Grey Beaver he considered he still belonged
BTS Buck can start a thousand pounds
BTS Johansen called out to Harrison to go out the halyards
BTS And then I am lonely
BTS It was not until January 1917 that we left the refuge
BTS This was a blunder on the part of the Oligarchy and a costly one
BTS But at the end of half an hour he arose growled wrathfully at the motionless ball and trotted on
BTS It seems asleep
BTS There was nothing to stop you nothing that could stop you
BTS he cried
BTS Then Buck sprang in and out
BTS Labor and capital having produced this one hundred dollars now proceed to divide it
BTS LAISSEZ-FAIRE the let-alone policy of each for himself and devil take the hindmost
BTS Do not be downcast Ernest said
BTS The sound of blows and scuffling came to our ears
BTS When I dismantled my old Pantheon and cast out Napoleon and Caesar and their fellows I straightway erected a new Pantheon she answered gravely and the first I installed was Dr
BTS There was a sizzle and odour of burning flesh and a sharp cry of pain
BTS She hung on striving to press down with her teeth to the great vein where his life-blood bubbled
BTS Calvin who were themselves farmers long since expropriated captured the farmers and threw their political strength away in a vain campaign
BTS I bet he was yelpin' as he went down their throats damn 'em
BTS If you don't mind my expressin' my feelin's Mr
BTS His master's voice acted on Buck like an electric shock He sprang to his feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous departure
BTS For he has what they have not purpose something to do and be done an all-absorbing end to strive to attain the desire to kill me the hope that he may kill me
BTS Why had I trusted myself within reach of those terrible arms
BTS He had neither whip nor club nor weapon
BTS And in but a short while he had carried all the articles from the cache and lowered them down to me
BTS It seemed the machine-guns could not get started
BTS And such a tangle halyards sheets guys down-hauls shrouds stays all washed about and back and forth and through and twined and knotted by the sea
BTS I sprang excitedly to my feet
BTS It sticks out all over your mug
BTS My woman my one small woman I said my free hand petting her shoulder in the way all lovers know though never learn in school
BTS There was much to interest him
BTS And bring out the cigars and the whisky you'll find in my berth
BTS I have sewed all my life in the old country and here in San Francisco--thirty-three years
BTS Following the cook's instructions I had gone into Wolf Larsen's state-room to put it to rights and make the bed
BTS Hammerfield was temporarily crushed and the battle raged on in new directions
BTS The numbness is growing
BTS You know how he leaped across the opening of the lazarette
BTS And yet this is not altogether true
BTS He worked as a night watchman hawked potatoes on the street pasted labels in a cannery warehouse was utility man in a paper-box factory and water-carrier for a street railway construction gang and even joined the Dishwashers' Union just before it fell to pieces
BTS And it was such dispiriting effort
BTS We stood in the water to our knees as I bared my head
BTS At first the killing of the white men's dogs had been a diversion
BTS Your stomach's sour
BTS I followed the Bishop into a small room ten by twelve in a rear tenement
BTS After a good day's killing I have seen our decks covered with hides and bodies slippery with fat and blood the scuppers running red
BTS You couldn't walk alone between two sunrises and hustle the meat for your belly for three meals
BTS The American Oligarchy was practically in possession of the world-market and scores of countries were flung out of that market with unconsumable and unsalable surpluses on their hands
BTS We could not escape
BTS For a pair of critics we agree famously I laughed
BTS My it's exciting
BTS The time was yet to come for independence
BTS For when one of the sailors lifted her into Wolf Larsen's downstretched arms she looked up into our curious faces and smiled amusedly and sweetly as only a woman can smile and as I had seen no one smile for so long that I had forgotten such smiles existed
BTS From every hill slope came the trickle of running water the music of unseen fountains
BTS I'll lay you another thousand at that figure Thornton
BTS Listen to them and find if it is hard to discover the most vital thing in their souls said Wolf Larsen
BTS Calvin said to Ernest
BTS The coffin at the side of the fire served for seat and table
BTS She began young it is true
BTS Shot in the breast was Hartman's report
BTS Best of all perhaps he loved to lie near the fire hind legs crouched under him fore legs stretched out in front head raised and eyes blinking dreamily at the flames
BTS Forty thousand were killed in the street-fighting of Tokio and in the futile assault on the Mikado's palace
BTS But how is it possible to be done
BTS Then you'll welter in your gore was his retort
BTS When this had been done a few times he learned the law and after that observed it
BTS God had stirred the nations to strife
BTS The capitalist being selfish wants all he can get in the division
BTS Yet White Fang was never effusively affectionate
BTS This first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland environment
BTS I had time to notice that the pockets of the dead man had been emptied on the deck and that his body and his grin had been wrapped from view in canvas the folds of which the sailor Johansen was sewing together with coarse white twine shoving the needle through with a leather contrivance fitted on the palm of his hand
BTS The last news I heard of him was that he had been sent to Boston or New Haven
BTS Even then it was not too late for Baseek to retrieve the situation
BTS but I saw her eyes return to his involuntarily as though fascinated
BTS White Fang crouched down and backed away bristling showing his fangs his eyes malignant with menace
BTS then sight and sound of her faded away and we were alone on the dark sea
BTS With condescension he accepted their condescension
BTS Again when he was weak it was his luck that none of the larger preying animals chanced upon him
BTS After that they threw stones no more and White Fang understood and was satisfied
BTS Everybody drank
BTS He slunk forlornly through the deserted camp smelling the rubbish-heaps and the discarded rags and tags of the gods
BTS the shutters to the shops were up
BTS But he's liable to any moment Scott answered
BTS I was pardonably curious in my survey for it appeared my fate to be pent up with them on this miniature floating world for I knew not how many weeks or months
BTS Here goes and bear with me if at first I seem irrelevant
BTS And furthermore I dare to say to you now that when I have finished you will not answer
BTS I did it beautifully Garthwaite was lamenting to me
BTS They were new dogs utterly transformed by the harness
BTS I pondered it long lying sleepless in my bunk and reviewing in endless procession the facts of the situation
BTS He brought his papers out at a loss of a million and a half each month
BTS But these too soon ceased and a semi-silence settled down broken by groans and sobs and sounds of strangulation
BTS Kiche was a remote memory
BTS For an appreciable lapse of time Ernest's voice continued to ring through the great room
BTS Drumhead court martial was their portion and military execution their end
BTS She turned and touched his neck with her muzzle in a reassuring way then regarded the camp again
BTS The next instant the latter kicked me violently as a cur is kicked
BTS His senses accustomed to the hum and bustle of the camp used to the continuous impact of sights and sounds were now left idle
BTS It was the case of General Lampton that revived crucifixion as a legal method of execution
BTS If he wasn't great would he have charge of the law business of the Sierra Mills of the Erston Land Syndicate of the Berkeley Consolidated of the Oakland San Leandro and Pleasanton Electric
BTS They draw their salaries for the policy they maintain
BTS He talked to White Fang as White Fang had never been talked to before
BTS I had heard of jerking beef on the plains and our seal-meat cut in thin strips and hung in the smoke cured excellently
BTS Where there is room for one life she sows a thousand lives and it's life eats life till the strongest and most piggish life is left
BTS We were travelling faster and heeled farther over
BTS And then you shall lie down and sleep
BTS Can you guess why I have sent for you
BTS This suggested an idea to me
BTS No thought of disloyalty I am sure has ever entered his mind during all that time
BTS You speak so calmly  she began
BTS Bill uttered an exclamation
BTS And there were so many gods
BTS Go and see Colonel Ingram
BTS In reality this was an alliance between the Emperor and the Oligarchy for the purpose of meeting their common foe the revolutionary proletariat of both countries
BTS Down the cross street we could see a few soldiers still running
BTS Life isn't you mean he smiled
BTS I studied her myself and though it was I who maintained the conversation I know that I was a bit shy not quite self-possessed
BTS She did not rush him now that her young one was safe
BTS Johansen however continued violently to urge him on to the completion of his task
BTS And then I realized something more
BTS Delay meant the coming against him of all the young dogs
BTS Another great institution that had taken form and was working smoothly was the Mercenaries
BTS Bill cautiously slipped the gun from under the sled-lashing
BTS He was right
BTS One Eye moved impatiently beside her
BTS No thank you Latimer spoke up
BTS In the days before White Fang had had the wisdom to cower down and submit to a man with a club in his hand
BTS Still he was not demonstrative
BTS I remember one man they dragged out of a heap who pleaded abjectly until a revolver shot cut him short
BTS The man you shot he is I hope
BTS You will observe there I said a slight trembling
BTS There could be but one result and that was that his ferocity fed upon itself and increased
BTS There was no withstanding him
BTS I haven't had a chance to look around yet
BTS Colonel Ingram blushed actually blushed and again he looked anxiously about him for a way of escape
BTS Billee wagged his tail appeasingly turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail and cried still appeasingly when Spitz's sharp teeth scored his flank
BTS Then he came in like a fresh-caught fish on a line clearing the rail generously and striking the deck in a heap on hands and knees and rolling over
BTS Then there was the campaign
BTS for the same reason I sail this schooner
BTS It's unfortunate he continued
BTS And since then I've noticed that three little corner groceries have gone out of business
BTS Leach approached me as I returned aft
BTS What does the fool up an' say when the old man calls him Yonson but Me name is Johnson sir' an' then spells it out letter for letter
BTS I had been made love to by beardless sophomores and gray professors and by the athletes and the football giants
BTS but single fight was denied him
BTS The pale light of the short sunless day was beginning to fade when a faint far cry arose on the still air
BTS His was a great soul and when my love grows unselfish my chiefest regret is that he is not here to witness to-morrow's dawn
BTS They come closer every night
BTS Asmunsen nodded
BTS But Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness imagination
BTS I read immortality in your eyes I answered dropping the sir an experiment for I thought the intimacy of the conversation warranted it
BTS The yeast has grown stale
BTS Pike and Dub followed on his heels with the rest of the team behind
BTS Mediocrity you see has its compensations
BTS He lay partly on his side panting for breath
BTS I'll tell you Ernest continued
BTS and father with his long and peaceful life was instanced as a shining example of how the bacillus of violence worked
BTS There was his wife Alice and then there were his children Weedon and Maud toddlers of four and six
BTS Kelly come aft and slack off the main-sheet
BTS The first laughter of the evening went around the table and even Mr
BTS Henry nodded his consent
BTS And I was indeed thankful for I had by this time learned enough to know with all our canvas spread what disaster in such event awaited us
BTS He stopped to listen to it then he finished his sentence with a wave of his hand toward the sound of the cry  one of them
BTS I felt a wilting sensation a sinking at the heart and I might just as well say a giddiness
BTS I can see it brewin' an' comin' up like a storm in the sky
BTS He crushed them and broke them on his large horns
BTS When she turned and tried to drag him back into the bush's shelter he pulled her away from it and on into the open
BTS He was not a free agent
BTS Before Colonel Van Gilbert had succeeded in sitting down Ernest was on his feet and had sprung forward
BTS Wickson and Mrs
BTS Sometimes however a nip on his hind-quarters hastened his retreat and made it anything but stately
BTS You see with these additions I've about all the crew I want
BTS He laughed and it was the first time I had heard honest mirth in his voice
BTS He might have been a trifle graver than of yore but the glint of laughter still was in his eyes
BTS Will you trust your life to it
BTS Morning came but for the first time the light of day failed to scatter the wolves
BTS Nevertheless Weedon Scott's ear and sympathy were fine enough to catch the new note all but drowned in the fierceness the note that was the faintest hint of a croon of content and that none but he could hear
BTS To the rear from around the last bend and plainly into view on the very trail they had just covered trotted a furry slinking form
BTS less aspiring
BTS But the she-wolf coolly thrust past him
BTS Why don't you come down and kill me you murderer
BTS That gives them all the more significance
BTS Matt concurred
BTS Humphrey Van Weyden
BTS He accepted it as he accepted all the unaccountable doings and manifestations of the gods
BTS He is without conscience
BTS Yes by your law the terrorist replied significantly
BTS By the time they took position the mob was upon them and it looked as though they would be overwhelmed before they could get into action
BTS The Thirty Mile River was comparatively coated with ice and they covered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in
BTS It had been peaceful in its occurrence sacred in its ceremonial
BTS Eh
BTS Your sociology is as vicious and worthless as is your method of thinking
BTS The carriage drove on and still Collie blocked White Fang's way
BTS The years were not many when the Yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves
BTS It was in Germany
BTS He was cordially detested by the proletariat of both countries
BTS This was my indictment and I specifically and at length challenged you to answer it
BTS or days of drizzling rain when we filled our water-breakers from the drip of the wet sail
BTS The ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life
BTS ' Yes sir I corrected
BTS I was compelled to let go the sheet while I helped her to the nest of blankets and chafed her hands and arms
BTS A madness comes up in my brain even now as I think of it
BTS I was interested as to which quatrain he would like best and was not surprised when he hit upon the one born of an instant's irritability and quite at variance with the Persian's complacent philosophy and genial code of life What without asking hither hurried Whence
BTS I will live to a hundred
BTS The fact is a man gets tired after he's been working for hours
BTS I'll make it explicit enough confound him father declared and departed for the bank to get the stock in question from his safe-deposit box
BTS There was the mainmast fifteen inches in diameter at what was now the butt still sixty-five feet in length and weighing I roughly calculated at least three thousand pounds
BTS No he answered I ain't for callin' it that
BTS At first he was unable to drag himself along and Beauty Smith had to wait half-an-hour for him
BTS I wish I were going to be there
BTS The first sounds were those of a conflict between a bull and a wolf
BTS He knew the law even better than did the dogs that had known no other life and he observed the law more punctiliously
BTS The possession of a god implies service
BTS only there's seven of 'em again
BTS But just as he was going he turned and said Oh by the way while you are ruining your own peace of mind and I am ruining the Bishop's you'd better look up Mrs
BTS I asked
BTS Several days passed during which I read Ernest's books borrowed from my father
BTS Bill shook it off
BTS Have you any dry clothes I may put on
BTS If the sight of him drove these strange dogs upon him so much the better for him so much the worse for them
BTS He was born of humble parents and began his career as a bartender
BTS and it came to Buck leading the pack sounding the old wolf-cry straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight
BTS He remembered her vaguely but he remembered her and that was more than could be said for her
BTS Mr
BTS It would have exploded prematurely
BTS But it occurred a century and a half ago
BTS Holding his weight by his arms and in mid-air doubling his body at the hips he let fly with both feet
BTS This is intolerable
BTS he sneered
BTS of the rough fare and rougher usage where kicks and blows were bed and breakfast and took the place of speech and fear and hatred and pain were my only soul-experiences
BTS The dogs he had fought with did not fight that way
BTS He had a method of accepting things without questioning the why and wherefore
BTS I struggled at the oars till I was played out
BTS The Appeal to Reason was a weekly and its regular circulation amongst the proletariat was seven hundred and fifty thousand
BTS for I knew that she must attend him and I wished to save her as much as possible
BTS It was as if he were saying farewell
BTS But when he challenged the truism I was speechless
BTS Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me
BTS But White Fang's throat had become harsh-fibred from the making of ferocious sounds through the many years since his first little rasp of anger in the lair of his cubhood and he could not soften the sounds of that throat now to express the gentleness he felt
BTS When we hove to a hasty though orderly confusion reigned
BTS A recrudescence of anger glinted in Weedon Scott's grey eyes and he muttered savagely The beast
BTS He did not rush a second time
BTS Of course you can't buy meat
BTS The wind had been momentarily increasing and the sun after a few angry gleams had disappeared
BTS By returning to a primitive method of production so confused and disorderly and irrational so wasteful and costly that it will be impossible to produce a surplus
BTS A laboratory experiment was no experiment if it were not carried through in all its details
BTS Did you see them leading him so solicitously from the platform
BTS One diversion of his when we were in the midst of the herd and the sea was too rough to lower the boats was to lower with two boat-pullers and a steerer and go out himself
BTS Wolf Larsen sprang on deck and so swiftly that by the time we followed him he had pulled the steerage-slide over the drunken clamour and was on his way forward to close the forecastle-scuttle
BTS No because the United States has herself a surplus
BTS At the Pelly one morning as they were harnessing up Dolly who had never been conspicuous for anything went suddenly mad
BTS At least speaking for myself I know I am braver than Captain Larsen
BTS Yet the failure of it accelerated his development
BTS beneath the flesh the spirit had still raged splendid and invincible
BTS Buck saw and his mates saw and they knew that this thing was very close to them
BTS You've never had any of your own
BTS But tell me what became of the owners of the three stores
BTS I shot it out of the pack in a moose pasture over on Little Stick
BTS He slid his head around a corner of rock where began an unusually large bend in the stream and his quick eyes made out something that sent him crouching swiftly down
BTS It is impossible for you to diminish your principal
BTS Everything shall be done here to keep the comrades quiet
BTS Wolf Larsen motioned Louis to keep off slightly and we dashed abreast of the boat not a score of feet to windward
BTS I did some rapid thinking
BTS He was thinking deeply and I could see the lines of decision forming in his face
BTS Before closing this incident I must give a scrap of conversation I had with Wolf Larsen in the cabin while I was washing the dishes
BTS At midnight the chill wind that blew drove him to shelter at the rear of the cabin
BTS But I said
BTS The Cockney became more humble and slavish to me than even to Wolf Larsen
BTS came the sharp command and this time he obeyed
BTS I always get along with the officers he remarked to me in a confidential tone
BTS He kept quiet no matter what injustice was perpetrated on him and really I think surprised his enemies
BTS With him came the first bull-dog that had ever entered the Klondike
BTS The newspapers will purge his heresy in the oblivion of silence
BTS We were too much alike in many things for argument
BTS The next moment similar sheets of flame and smoke smote the front of the building across the street opposite it
BTS This accomplished the outfit though cut in half was still a formidable bulk
BTS Suspicion by the nature of the situation was turned aside
BTS One hundred and eighty-five dollars sir I answered
BTS It was warm and comfortable and he was playing cribbage with the Factor
BTS I remember the scene impelled me to sudden laughter and in the next instant I realized I was becoming hysterical myself
BTS This in itself was compensation for it is always easier to lean upon another than to stand alone
BTS Watching my chance I stole five cans of the milk and that night when it was Louis's watch on deck I traded them with him for a dirk as lean and cruel-looking as Thomas Mugridge's vegetable knife
BTS Calling to Maud to cease lowering I went on deck and made the watch-tackle fast to the mast with a rolling hitch
BTS And ever I loved Maud with an increasing love
BTS Well
BTS And thus without speech we waited the end
BTS It was the same with his hair sparse and irregular of growth muddy-yellow and dirty-yellow rising on his head and sprouting out of his face in unexpected tufts and bunches in appearance like clumped and wind-blown grain
BTS His eyes saw correctly and the nerves carried the vision correctly to his brain
BTS while sea and sun had tanned the naturally fair skin to a dark bronze which bespoke struggle and battle and added both to his savagery and his beauty
BTS I chucked off the belt with my right hand he said an' made a reach for the flint with my left
BTS You are  She was now staring at me in wide-eyed wonder
BTS What have become of the owners of the small drug stores that you forced to the wall
BTS I was working in a livery stable in San Francisco then
BTS But what if the Grangers fail to get possession
BTS It was the face I am convinced of a man who did no wrong
BTS The master rubbed his ears and he crooned his love-growl
BTS There was no record of his death
BTS She had been right
BTS It was quite unexpected but he met me with his bold eyes and firm hand-clasp and with that curious blend of his awkwardness and ease
BTS profit
BTS The sparkling points of light flashed past me in an interminable stream as though the whole sidereal system were dropping into the void
BTS Don't forget that they have already traded with one another and that these surpluses yet remain
BTS His brow clouded at the allusion
BTS It was the guerdon of my love for him
BTS Ghent
BTS Incidentally I may state that in my dual role I managed a few important things for the Revolution
BTS In teaching her I learned quite a deal myself though I was applying the knowledge already acquired by sailing the Ghost and by watching the boat-steerers sail the small boats
BTS It was an old song old as the breed itself one of the first songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad
BTS Their movements perceptibly quickened under his coaching and as the boat swung inboard I was sent forward to let go the jibs
BTS Our courses were converging like the sides of an angle the vertex of which was at the edge of the fog-bank
BTS In the cabin I found all hands assembled sailors as well and while coffee was being cooked over the small stove we drank whisky and crunched hard-tack
BTS Faith
BTS the next day thirty-five more to the Little Salmon
BTS But of course it is out of the question that Johnson should thrash Wolf Larsen
BTS Everywhere with the exception of two or three countries the erstwhile capitalist masters fought bitterly for their possessions
BTS All the while I had been apprehensive concerning my own predicament
BTS Let us see
BTS Look at dat Buck
BTS It was in line with these experiences that White Fang came to learn the law of property and the duty of the defence of property
BTS Daylight was yet three hours away though it was already six o'clock
BTS 'Tis no heart he has at all
BTS You see the sacredness of our hospitality I said bitterly to Maud Brewster
BTS This editor who published patent medicine advertisements called me a scoundrelly demagogue because I dared him to print in his paper the truth about patent medicines
BTS In truth Harrison was very sick as a person is sea-sick
BTS but he was too strong
BTS Kowalt asked
BTS His last word in striking contrast with the smoothness of his previous utterance snapped like the lash of a whip
BTS And so it was that father kept on at our Pell Street quarters while Ernest and I went to Washington
BTS Ninety cents per week
BTS He dreamed
BTS The carriage was bearing the master away
BTS He talked softly and soothingly with a gentleness that somehow somewhere touched White Fang
BTS That'll do Johansen Wolf Larsen said brusquely
BTS You have made a shambles of civilization
BTS It was nearly out
BTS What occurred in those intervals I know not and never shall know
BTS I thought something was wrong
BTS You are very kind I am sure she murmured
BTS Wolf Larsen cried
BTS for a heavy shoe whizzed through the semi-darkness and Mr
BTS I talked a great deal and enthusiastically as a hero-worshipper might talk and it was obvious that he was my hero
BTS But she shook her head as one might shake off sleep or a dream saying I have known it all my life
BTS Her head appeared under the flap of the sail
BTS but my first impression or feel of the man was not of this but of his strength
BTS It's dead safe
BTS CHAPTER XIX I came on deck to find the Ghost heading up close on the port tack and cutting in to windward of a familiar spritsail close-hauled on the same tack ahead of us
BTS Not at all
BTS But your example is unfortunate
BTS I asked
BTS We were all seated when Miss Brentwood brought Ernest in
BTS She was a delicate ethereal creature swaying and willowy light and graceful of movement
BTS I should have been crushed had it not been for Garthwaite
BTS I guess that's what it ought to be called
BTS though I noticed when we returned to the deck a slight twitching of the nostrils a perceptible quickness of movement
BTS I say this is a pretty warm reception for a poor lone wolf from the Arctic the master said while White Fang calmed down under his caressing hand
BTS he demanded abruptly turning back to me
BTS At the faint sound of his distant feet before he came in sight White Fang knew who was coming and began to bristle
BTS Rain-squalls were driving in between and I could scarcely see the fog
BTS I never was so apparelled in my life
BTS Also it seemed to him that the fort was besieged by wolves
BTS The cub's shoulder was stiff and sore and for some time he limped from the terrible slash he had received
BTS They possessed greater mastery over matter than the gods he had known most powerful among which was Grey Beaver
BTS You sir have brilliantly exemplified my statement
BTS True Christ died between two thieves but that is another story
BTS The conversation at the table was of other things
BTS The grey cub's eyes had not been open long yet already he could see with steady clearness
BTS Matt followed with the lamp and by its light they saw a man lying on his back in the snow
BTS I wondered what this man could have got from such a work
BTS His jaws were apart and through them the tongue protruded draggled and limp
BTS After that the rest of you can come at me--but one at a time remember
BTS He had no arms with which to attack me from a distance
BTS And there were many Jacksons--hundreds of them in the mills alone as Jackson himself had said
BTS Hold on there
BTS and it was the she-wolf who was first to spring away from the cornered man in his circle of dying flame
BTS The tall young newcomer was forcing his way through shouldering men right and left without ceremony or gentleness
BTS On one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength
BTS He knew only how to fight and fight with them he did returning to them a hundred-fold the snaps and slashes they had given him in the days when Lip-lip was leader of the pack
BTS There was something tenacious about that lily-frail body of hers a clutch on existence which one could not reconcile with its patent weakness
BTS the wounded drank
BTS That it may not be premature
BTS Weedon Scott waved a last good-bye
BTS How do you like my definition
BTS The cub entertained a great respect for his mother
BTS Now give me a growl the last good good-bye growl
BTS A mortgage was foreclosed on it and we had to give up possession
BTS And if at the end of the afternoon White Fang hasn't harmed a chicken for every ten minutes of the time he has spent in the yard you will have to say to him gravely and with deliberation just as if you were sitting on the bench and solemnly passing judgment White Fang you are smarter than I thought
BTS He had for the moment mistaken me for the man he hated
BTS But the man who went softly by circuitous ways peering with caution seeking after secrecy that was the man who received no suspension of judgment from White Fang and who went away abruptly hurriedly and without dignity
BTS But I am still here all here the hand scrawled more slowly and painfully than ever
BTS To bring forgetfulness or the light of gladness into those poor tired eyes of his--what greater joy could have blessed me than that
BTS He lived tensely
BTS Guided by that instinct which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world Buck proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd
BTS Let me answer Colonel Van Gilbert
BTS His dream was merging into something else he knew not what
BTS It is you who have made me brave
BTS Beef-tea
BTS but it is definitely settled now that the ghetto was fired by the Mercenaries under orders from their chiefs
BTS From the head of the lawn on the first soft swell from the valley-level looked down the deep-porched many-windowed house
BTS He cleared the sheet and was free to return slightly downhill now along the halyards to the mast
BTS and for the rest of the afternoon we made merry over our labour
BTS but he did not know the chewing method of fighting nor were his jaws adapted to it
BTS I can ponder life and death like a Hindoo sage
BTS Through its spy-system the Iron Heel got wind of the Revolt and prepared to teach us another of its bloody lessons
BTS They did cut up more'n usual Henry acknowledged
BTS Let us oust the present owners of the wonderful machines and let us own the wonderful machines ourselves
BTS While I toiled at rigging the foremast Maud sewed on canvas ready always to drop everything and come to my assistance when more hands than two were required
BTS and though he listened through long vigils the mournful howl was never raised
BTS Lie down sir
BTS Came days of fog when even Maud's spirit drooped and there were no merry words upon her lips
BTS It might have been a lost soul wailing had it not been invested with a certain sad fierceness and hungry eagerness
BTS White Fang came near to him and watched
BTS but Francois was a French-Canadian half-breed and twice as swarthy
BTS May be there were other ptarmigan hens
BTS From several blocks away came the crackle of small hand-bombs and the churning of machine-guns and from a long way off came a long series of heavy explosions
BTS So saying he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna sausage down upon the bar
BTS he cried
BTS Yet it moved
BTS There was no time to investigate
BTS But first you must be more warmly clad
BTS I had lost my watch and had no idea of the time
BTS But how
BTS Therefore come next Tuesday night
BTS They had constituted a kind apart and here abruptly he had discovered many more creatures apparently of his own kind
BTS It was after Everhard's execution that his wife went to Wake Robin Lodge a small bungalow in the Sonoma Hills of California
BTS If you say so I'll turn and go back
BTS I would fall asleep in the act of carrying food to my mouth and waken in torment to find the act yet uncompleted
BTS And he nodded his young head sagely
BTS I stiffened myself to refuse and shook my head
BTS A man of whom to be always afraid  That's the way to put it
BTS He was a poet
BTS She sat up and began making her simple toilet
BTS He used to tell with great glee how they were wont to shake their heads mournfully at the price to accomplish ponderously a bit of mental arithmetic and then to say But you can't make six per cent on it
BTS It was a pitiful spectacle
BTS What you need is rest and I should like you to remain and get it
BTS And here confined hidden from view all except his ears no longer growling he continued to nudge and snuggle
BTS But I fail to see that this steamer has any designs on your purse
BTS Why don't women wear their hair down always
BTS And it is all very beautiful this shaking off of the flesh and soaring of the imprisoned spirit
BTS And beneath will be the abyss wherein will fester and starve and rot and ever renew itself the common people the great bulk of the population
BTS but the warm airs of the south fanned my desire for a warmer sea and swayed my decision
BTS How I had welcomed each of them
BTS It was a matter of principle and conscience
BTS They had lost no dogs during the night and they swung out upon the trail and into the silence the darkness and the cold with spirits that were fairly light
BTS She did not speak but nodded her head
BTS White Fang who had never known sickness in his life became sick
BTS Our
BTS Strong enough themselves to weather the storm that was largely their own brewing they turned loose and plundered the wrecks that floated about them
BTS Capital and labor should be friends
BTS The people of that age were phrase slaves
BTS and so I considered with grave deliberation for a moment
BTS She was not so amenable to the law as he
BTS I want to ask you some questions
BTS And then the capitalists controlling the legislative and judicial machinery of the state of Colorado charged the miners with the crime and came very near to convicting them
BTS And I have learned a great lesson
BTS It was the crucial moment
BTS We were talking of Harris I said to Wolf Larsen
BTS It is your own empirical generalization and it is correct
BTS Their stringy muscles seemed founts of inexhaustible energy
BTS He cocked his ears and watched it curiously
BTS And during all this time free licence had been theirs from their masters to kill the things of the Wild
BTS On your life don't stumble and go down
BTS Don't look Miss Brewster please don't look I had begged of her and I was glad that she had minded me and been spared the sight
BTS Even in death she seemed loath to part with that which had caused her death
BTS Not that Cherokee was slow
BTS It was an imminent peril
BTS Here you what are you up to
BTS He was sore beset
BTS And when he put the wheel hard over and the Ghost's bow swung off there was nothing for the hunters to do but obey and make the best of a risky chance
BTS By looking closely and steadily at where a pair of eyes burned in the darkness the form of the animal would slowly take shape
BTS CHAPTER XXI THE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST During the long period of our stay in the refuge we were kept closely in touch with what was happening in the world without and we were learning thoroughly the strength of the Oligarchy with which we were at war
BTS Most of us came in
BTS The Blessed Wolf
BTS Well I'll be everlastingly gosh-swoggled
BTS Therefrom comes their sanction to manage the bread and butter of the rest of mankind
BTS and I caught one glimpse of his face malignant and triumphant as his other hand compassed my body and I was drawn down to him in a terrible grip
BTS The Ghost at the moment was uptossed on a sea and I caught a clear view of a small steamship two or three miles away rolling and pitching head on to the sea as it steamed toward us
BTS He had eaten the ptarmigan chicks
BTS Denied the expression of power amongst his own kind he fell back upon the lesser creatures and there vindicated the life that was in him
BTS Among others to show the whimsicality of their deadly seriousness may be mentioned the following The Bleeding Hearts Sons of the Morning the Morning Stars The Flamingoes The Triple Triangles The Three Bars The Rubonics The Vindicators The Comanches and the Erebusites
BTS The sailors in the main were English and Scandinavian and their faces seemed of the heavy stolid order
BTS CHAPTER II CHALLENGES
BTS All cities and towns were like armed camps and laborers were shot down like dogs
BTS In half a day I got the two topmasts aboard and the shears rigged and guyed as before
BTS Such boldness on the part of a man of my own class would have been almost unforgivable
BTS he laughed
BTS And if I were you I'd hunt cover right now
BTS Dr
BTS Placing this under his shoulders I balanced him across the threshold and lowered him down the steps to the floor
BTS He should be alive to-day like your father
BTS So he followed morosely at Beauty Smith's heels his tail between his legs yet snarling softly under his breath
BTS Maud I said
BTS The salary was comparatively large and would make safe our marriage
BTS As for the Bishop he has no daughter
BTS He was aware only of curiosity in all the things about him
BTS The noises grew indistinct though I heard a final and despairing chorus of screams in the distance and knew that the Martinez had gone down
BTS He held me from him at arm's length and stared about in annoyance and perplexity
BTS But something had happened
BTS There is no other way out
BTS But I'll tell you what I'll lay odds of five to one it's the Macedonia
BTS Often and often her last-reserve force gone I have seen her stretched flat on her back on the sand in the way she had of resting and recuperating
BTS She dearly loved children but she held that a child of her own would claim her from the Cause and that it was the Cause to which her life was devoted
BTS And well he revenged himself
BTS That for your immature generalizations and childish reasonings
BTS It can be done it can be done I was thinking and asserting aloud
BTS Throw away that tent and all those dishes who's going to wash them anyway
BTS He had no further serious trouble with the dogs
BTS And while his eyes were still closed he had felt tasted and smelled
BTS Day came and still the wind beat on our faces and the white seas roared past
BTS The mother ptarmigan was in a fury
BTS The milk he had sucked with his first flickering life was milk transformed directly from meat and now at a month old when his eyes had been open for but a week he was beginning himself to eat meat meat half-digested by the she-wolf and disgorged for the five growing cubs that already made too great demand upon her breast
BTS There is no more horrible page in history than the treatment of the child and women slaves in the English factories in the latter half of the eighteenth century of the Christian Era
BTS They made a fool out of Jackson and out of me too
BTS Once again about and the Ghost headed out to open sea
BTS The effect was charming
BTS Here was fear and it did not require his instinct to tell him of it
BTS I have neither aptitude nor inclination for fiction
BTS Oh yes I can I retorted
BTS The Gold Commissioner's a special pal of his
BTS He fascinated me immeasurably and I feared him immeasurably
BTS Thornton was sent spinning and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of the bar
BTS The grey mist drove by us like a rain
BTS It was necessary that I should be completely lost if ever I was to see Ernest again for by trailing me after he escaped he would be caught once more
BTS He avoided them and passed down the porch but they cornered him against a rocking-chair and the railing
BTS These great trees even sprang out from the walls of the hole
BTS There was a nook on the bottom of the great hole where the sun shone for several hours and which was hidden from above
BTS Hove to under this short canvas our decks were comparatively free of water while the Ghost bobbed and ducked amongst the combers like a cork
BTS into street railways into national state and municipal bonds
BTS Here we would catch a train to New York
BTS Bullets are liable to come aboard and I don't want you killed you know
BTS At night camp was made
BTS And on still another day two dogs were set against him at the same time
BTS Smooth-shaven every line was distinct and it was cut as clear and sharp as a cameo
BTS I could not hurt a fly I smiled back bitterly
BTS When I started to leave he dropped back into his whine
BTS And you don't know who or what she is eh
BTS It was quite a famous train
BTS Buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent and load the sled
BTS Well give it to him
BTS but the one thing we could not afford to fail in was the punishment of our own traitors
BTS He had been listening at the galley door but he now came out ostensibly to fling some scraps over the side but obviously to see the killing he was certain would take place
BTS They attached the line with which they had been snubbing the boat to Buck's neck and shoulders being careful that it should neither strangle him nor impede his swimming and launched him into the stream
BTS The strike had tied everything up so that nobody could work
BTS Watch me I said
BTS He sorrowed too loudly and woke up Grey Beaver who beat him
BTS So he went out of his way to be especially kind to the Fighting Wolf
BTS so different from shooting them
BTS He favoured me with a quizzical smile
BTS I held that life was a ferment a yeasty something which devoured life that it might live and that living was merely successful piggishness
BTS We toiled hard and suffered greatly filled the gaps in our ranks and went on and through all the labour and the play and interplay of life and death we found time to laugh and love
BTS Why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate
BTS The millions of the discontented and the impoverished are ours the socialists said
BTS They impressed him as possessing superior power and it is on power that godhead rests
BTS And that he betrayed his Fighting Group is an absolute lie
BTS Good or bad
BTS It was the safest route
BTS Good-by and good luck
BTS and the celerity with which Buck broke them in took away Francois's breath
BTS And as I choked and strangled and as the Ghost wallowed for an instant broadside on and rolling straight over and far into the wind I beheld a huge sea rise far above my head
BTS They struck him with their fists kicked him with their heavy shoes knocked him down and dragged him to his feet to knock him down again
BTS I tell yer he's all right I could hear Leach saying as I went up the ladder
BTS Again and again as he looked at each brutal performance the lesson was driven home to Buck a man with a club was a lawgiver a master to be obeyed though not necessarily conciliated
BTS As it was the situation stopped there in the only way it could
BTS Sure the man replied driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry
BTS And your minds are filled with doctrines that are buttresses of the established order
BTS I hid him and tonight I will go back and bury him deep
BTS Each year one had come from the press and to me each was the advent of the year
BTS I have heard of such things
BTS This idea as I say was merely carried to its logical conclusion on a large scale by the combination of the oligarchs and the favored unions
BTS I strove to compel myself to think we would make the landing safely and so I spoke not what I believed but what I preferred to believe
BTS The stiff breeze and heavy sea which had sprung up the previous afternoon had been moderating all morning so that it was now possible to lower the boats for an afternoon's hunt
BTS It was in the nature of things that he must learn quickly if he were to survive the unusually severe conditions under which life was vouchsafed him
BTS He tried to soothe his nose with his tongue but the tongue was burnt too and the two hurts coming together produced greater hurt
BTS Father must have had strong in him the blood of adventure
BTS And in that moment as I saw the harshness form in their faces and saw the fight-light flashing in their eyes I realized that not easily would they let their lordship of the world be wrested from them
BTS Somehow Tommy's grub always tastes of grease stale grease and I reckon he ain't changed his shirt since he left 'Frisco
BTS The hunter and boat-puller were both lying awkwardly in the bottom but the boat-steerer lay across the gunwale half in and half out his arms trailing in the water and his head rolling from side to side
BTS Spit it out
BTS He arose and began in a few well-chosen phrases that carried an undertone of faint irony to introduce Ernest
BTS One chance in a thousand is really optimistic
BTS I shall call you that name
BTS I'm agreein' with you only
BTS Besides the women proved to be the strongest promoters of the strike
BTS Through chapter after chapter he is worried by the one event that cometh to all alike
BTS The middle class is a wobbly little lamb between a lion and a tiger
BTS You counted wrong
BTS When I had the boat empty again I was forced to take away the tarpaulin which covered Maud in order that I might lash it down across the bow
BTS One of the grooms ran to the rescue
BTS Knowing his deadly method of fighting the master had never ceased impressing upon White Fang the law that he must not fight
BTS This convention had been called to consider public immorality and the remedy for it
BTS Hush
BTS Second is the middle class your class gentlemen which is composed of farmers merchants small manufacturers and professional men
BTS With the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead or the stars leaping in the frost dance and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life only it was pitched in minor key with long-drawn wailings and half-sobs and was more the pleading of life the articulate travail of existence
BTS Without any antecedent knowledge without any warning whatever that such existed he found himself an explorer in a totally new world
BTS I could not put my weight on it or at least I thought I could not put my weight on it
BTS A cry arose that we were sinking
BTS Clew up the topsails first
BTS As before we drifted down upon it
BTS Its limits were the walls of the lair
BTS The feeble flame must be cherished tenderly if it were to gather strength and live
BTS Here and there a soldier was discharging his rifle but this scattered fire had no effect in checking the mob
BTS Emotional delight is more filling and lasting than intellectual delight
BTS It issues countless thousands of free passes to judges bankers editors ministers university men members of state legislatures and of Congress
BTS Two billions are left to capital
BTS All feuds and grudges were forgotten and I was surprised at the alacrity with which the men who had so long endured his brutality sprang to execute his orders
BTS I struck a match and looked at my watch
BTS And to cap it all when Mercedes with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver in her throat could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more she stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly
BTS Then a panic seized the Yeehats and they fled in terror to the woods proclaiming as they fled the advent of the Evil Spirit
BTS There is wild talk of cannon aboard and of strange raids and expeditions she may make ranging from opium smuggling into the States and arms smuggling into China to blackbirding and open piracy
BTS for when you do you are sure to override my authority
BTS It was heresy
BTS How I hated him
BTS Yet I knew I must control myself for Maud Brewster's sake and I received my reward when her eyes caught mine for a fleeting second and they said as distinctly as if she spoke Be brave be brave
BTS I knew it now for what it was
BTS I am used to it
BTS Mugridge's arm and help him up on deck
BTS The hard times of 1912 had already caused a frightful slump in the farm markets
BTS This was a false syllogism that conclusion had no connection with the premise while that next premise was an impostor because it had cunningly hidden in it the conclusion that was being attempted to be proved
BTS I knew not what had aroused me but I found myself out of my bunk on my feet wide awake my soul vibrating to the warning of danger as it might have thrilled to a trumpet call
BTS You run ahead too fast O'Connor answered
BTS has been described as follows A long lean head semicircled by a fringe of brown and gray hair with big cheek-bones and a heavy chin
BTS You exert all your puny strength to struggle to live
BTS While this went on and Beauty Smith continued to kick White Fang there was a commotion in the crowd
BTS Those behind urged on and the column from gutter to gutter telescoped upon itself
BTS An age of selfishness was dawning upon mankind
BTS His was a better far better nervous mental and muscular co-ordination
BTS Just as I contended right along
BTS Sure
BTS Through information furnished by its spies scores of our refuges were raided by the soldiers of the Iron Heel
BTS And then a deer a many-pronged buck the sun flashing red-gold from neck and shoulders cleared the crest of the ridge before us and was gone
BTS CHAPTER III Wolf Larsen ceased swearing as suddenly as he had begun
BTS Burning brands made them spring aside but they no longer sprang back
BTS Henry nodded his head approvingly
BTS It would have been possible within a few months to have effected the escape of some of them
BTS With the destruction of Hearst and the Democratic Party there were only two paths for his following to take
BTS the blind fought the blind
BTS Mr
BTS The fact that he had hands feet and a body shaped somewhat like mine constituted a claim which I could not ignore
BTS But Wolf Larsen as was to be expected being a boat short took possession of the first stray one and compelled its men to hunt with the Ghost not permitting them to return to their own schooner when we sighted it
BTS That's all right Standish was the reply
BTS There was a carriage waiting
BTS Get in the topsails and jibs and make a good job of it
BTS Under way and with nothing for the time being to do I turned my attention to the situation of the boats
BTS When they halted the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead
BTS When she snarled her displeasure the old leader would whirl on the three-year-old
BTS He had not mended his ways nor his shirt though the latter he contended he had changed
BTS A few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark
BTS But she straightened it the next moment
BTS All this I saw on the very instant of seeing and as I sprang forward
BTS I set the sail laid one tack out of the cove and on the other tack made our own little inner cove
BTS Men gasped and began to breathe again unaware that for a moment they had ceased to breathe
BTS It was in such a storm and the worst that we had experienced that I cast a weary glance to leeward not in quest of anything but more from the weariness of facing the elemental strife and in mute appeal almost to the wrathful powers to cease and let us be
BTS Bishop Morehouse hesitated
BTS Skin-grafting and hair-transplanting were among their commonest devices
BTS He turned his head and blinked at the men who shouted at the same time wagging his stump of a tail good-naturedly
BTS It is plain that his mother is Kiche
BTS We were already under way all sails set and drawing and the sheets being slacked off for a wind abeam as the last boat lifted clear of the water and swung in the tackles
BTS This was the pride that bore up Spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in the morning
BTS They went down the valley of the stream far beyond White Fang's widest ranging until they came to the end of the valley where the stream ran into the Mackenzie River
BTS Not one succeeded in laying a hand on him and it was well that they did not
BTS His first prominence had come when he broke the Shardwell will
BTS It was always his way to turn the point back upon an opponent and he did it now with a beaming brotherliness of face and utterance
BTS I waited patiently
BTS Just now he ran blindly his own bank of the Mackenzie alone entering into his calculations
BTS Then I removed the sprit tightly hauling down the peak of the sail and we raced along under what sailors call a leg-of-mutton
BTS And of course you will all keep my secret
BTS The blood from his nose gushed in a scarlet stream over the feet of the helmsman who was none other than Louis his boat-mate
BTS You on the inside were caught napping this time he said
BTS and on top of it he learned to avoid hurt first by not incurring the risk of it
BTS He doubled it
BTS Suddenly he found himself at the mouth of the cave
BTS And though they were making poor time the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely
BTS Between the explosions we could hear the rattle of the automatic pistols and rifles
BTS Mr
BTS Her gaze was unfaltering but soft
BTS Otherwise he ignored them
BTS And third and last comes my class the proletariat which is composed of the wage-workers
BTS The frivolity of the laughter-loving Latins is no part of him
BTS Stand by that jib with Johnson and Oofty
BTS He was appalled by the selfishness he encountered and what had surprised him even more than that was the absence of intellectual life
BTS It's the wrong direction but we'll get out somehow
BTS and Thomas Mugridge fled swiftly aft and disappeared down another companion-way near the wheel
BTS Wall Street--so named from a street in ancient New York where was situated the stock exchange and where the irrational organization of society permitted underhanded manipulation of all the industries of the country
BTS a very sick man Hump he said as he left my sustaining grip and sank into a chair
BTS The teeth of one had closed upon his arm
BTS It goes on everywhere
BTS There was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance
BTS Next day both Germany and the United States declared war and within an hour the socialists called the general strike in both countries
BTS I returned to Wolf Larsen's bunk
BTS while Smoke and Henderson convalescent under a deck awning and swinging day and night in their hammocks assured me that I was better than any hospital nurse and that they would not forget me at the end of the voyage when they were paid off
BTS Buck made no effort
BTS There I disagree said the Bishop
BTS The unrest of the dogs had been increasing and they stampeded in a surge of sudden fear to the near side of the fire cringing and crawling about the legs of the men
BTS Tried to steal you eh
BTS pension as soldiers those who grow honorably old in their toil and there will be no need for charity
BTS It is not right she concluded
BTS yet this in itself was not so remarkable being done by the same creatures that flung sticks and stones to great distances
BTS To Buck it was boundless delight this hunting fishing and indefinite wandering through strange places
BTS It was those cursed headaches brought it on
BTS The dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as Spitz disappeared from view
BTS I worked up ever since
BTS Undreamed of and unheralded it had come
BTS don't you think so
BTS Better years on the island than to die to-night or to-morrow or the next day in the open boat
BTS They did not remain in one place but travelled across country until they regained the Mackenzie River down which they slowly went leaving it often to hunt game along the small streams that entered it but always returning to it again
BTS and asleep I left her under a heavy pair of sailor's blankets her head resting on a pillow I had appropriated from Wolf Larsen's bunk
BTS Our lips were dry and cracked nor could we longer moisten them with our tongues
BTS Please please she pleaded and she disarmed me by the words as I was to discover they would ever disarm me
BTS CHAPTER XXV You've been on deck Mr
BTS But my eyes must have closed the instant my head touched the pillow and in utter exhaustion I slept throughout the night the while the Ghost lonely and undirected fought her way through the storm
BTS They worked together more smoothly and steadily
BTS This was a great relief and Buck caused even the weazened face of Perrault to twist itself into a grin one morning when Francois forgot the moccasins and Buck lay on his back his four feet waving appealingly in the air and refused to budge without them
BTS But you never read our papers
BTS And furthermore I hold that whatever is horrible in industrial society is due to the ignorance of the capitalist class
BTS And he did it so quickly that the boy did not know either
BTS Surely
BTS The world of books and bookish folk is very vague more like a dream memory than an actuality
BTS She was strangely stirred and sniffed and sniffed with an increasing delight
BTS Not when the government suspends civil law
BTS and our moments were sweeter for being stolen
BTS that destroyed San Francisco
BTS After that they'll be friends
BTS But blood had been shed and it was through no whim of Wolf Larsen that he had gone over the side with his scalp laid open
BTS You jes' shut up now an' go to sleep an' you'll be all hunkydory in the mornin'
BTS Then get in here and break this grip
BTS As I say don't take my word for it
BTS Schooner-man
BTS But it was only for a moment
BTS If I am immortal why
BTS Who's croaking now
BTS Pig
BTS The famine broke
BTS the chemistry of the life that composed them demanded the light as a necessity of being
BTS I was growing angry
BTS Then she dropped her eyes to lift them again laughing
BTS He never slept more than four and one-half hours a night
BTS The seven ptarmigan chicks and the baby weasel represented the sum of his killings
BTS but it was quite a different matter for a lone wolf to encounter a lynx especially when the lynx was known to have a litter of hungry kittens at her back
BTS Public questions were gravely debated and passed upon according to the old forms while in reality all that was done was to give the stamp of constitutional procedure to the mandates of the Oligarchy
BTS You pulled aside the veils from the social shams
BTS he has but to fall down and kiss her breast and he is strong again
BTS There were other things on the sled blankets an axe and a coffee-pot and frying-pan
BTS The shears rose in the air
BTS There was puzzlement in his voice
BTS Then I understood
BTS Mention was made in one or two of the papers that he had been overcome by his feelings
BTS Mush on
BTS I held up my hand as she was about to speak
BTS His outlook was bleak and materialistic
BTS Apt scholar that he was they were equally apt teachers never allowing him to linger long in error and enforcing their teaching with their sharp teeth
BTS They know the direction by compass the distance and the speed
BTS I can tell them how I found you
BTS You have said a dozen of you to-night that socialism is impossible
BTS He held out a small piece of meat
BTS But the next moment his footing would be lost and he would be dragging around in the whirl of one of White Fang's mad gyrations
BTS They could not leave their masters for their masters composed the Plutocracy
BTS The porcupine might unroll
BTS It was no longer his dog
BTS It ran below its ordinary speed
BTS Then there will be huts to build and driftwood to gather
BTS Also he used to call me his dualist and he would explain how Kant by means of pure reason had abolished reason in order to worship God
BTS They travelled on without speech saving their breath for the work of their bodies
BTS Intellectually they were children inhabiting the physical forms of men
BTS The rise of this vote clearly indicates the swift growth of the party of revolution
BTS To them the elimination of scars and disfigurements was a trivial detail
BTS I got little out of him
BTS He could not be satisfied with less as Matt learned after much inconvenience and trouble
BTS I could almost believe in God
BTS I am so tired so tired
BTS His voice sounded harsh
BTS We are beaten
BTS I do nothing can do nothing because I am a slave to this monster as you are now a slave to him
BTS The guys had been slashed right and left
BTS Everything went smoothly and I laughed at Ernest when he looked upon the very smoothness as something ominous
BTS Rebuttal was precisely similar
BTS The impact of the blow drove her backward but she struck the wall of her on-coming fellows and bounced forward again dazed and helpless the brandished hatchet falling feebly on Hartman's shoulder
BTS Its bulk like that of some huge monster blocked our path
BTS I was still a tyro so far as concerned knowing how to behave in desperate circumstances
BTS But the whole truth was not told
BTS What's wrong
BTS Young dogs are bound to play and out of the exigencies of the situation they realised their play in this mimic warfare
BTS They made the clothes but they shiver in rags and ask you the lawyer or business agent who handles your money for a job
BTS Who made those beds
BTS I rolled off and over to the deck on my back gasping and blinking in the sunshine
BTS As well as I could make out the kneecap seemed turned up on edge in the midst of the swelling
BTS She looked over the breakfast noting detail after detail
BTS And even Billee the good-natured was less good-natured and whined not half so placatingly as in former days
BTS Both sides of his neck and head were ripped and slashed
BTS They shook their heads
BTS For that matter though not amative to any considerable degree so far as I have discovered I was never outside the atmosphere of women until now
BTS Their wages will go down and their hours will increase
BTS his feet struck the deck squarely and with surety
BTS How the scene comes back to me
BTS He cooked breakfast in the darkness and at nine o'clock when with the coming of daylight the wolf-pack drew back he set about the task he had planned through the long hours of the night
BTS Scott asked nudging White Fang with his foot
BTS But blimey if I cared
BTS His lash was always singing among the dogs but it was of small avail
BTS Baer with the enunciation of the following principle The rights and interests of the laboring man will be protected by the Christian men to whom God in His infinite wisdom has given the property interests of the country
BTS But we do not know
BTS The Ghost is considered the fastest schooner in both the San Francisco and Victoria fleets
BTS Wolf Larsen was unconscious but it was a matter of minutes for the fresh air to restore him
BTS I cast off the tackles and leaped after her
BTS The faro-dealer grunted
BTS He was called Sol-leks which means the Angry One
BTS My arms were about him and his head was on my breast
BTS He glanced at her a moment's amusement softening his features
BTS Only I don't know what hit me
BTS From one of those countless windows the bomb had been thrown but which window
BTS Wolf Larsen put thumb and forefinger to the wrist and counted the pulse
BTS Once he threw his heavy sheath-knife missing Wolf Larsen's throat by an inch
BTS And here in this inferno of luggage was White Fang deserted by the master
BTS It is a sad case
BTS So we paused a moment and looked back
BTS but day broke cold and cheerless with the same clouded sky and beating wind and roaring seas
BTS My father stopped to listen became interested effected a meeting and after quite an acquaintance invited him to the ministers' dinner
BTS At that time one Felice Van Verdighan accompanied by two maids and a lap-dog with another maid for the lap-dog entered a drawing-room on a Pullman and a few minutes later was speeding west
BTS He was oppressed with a sense of calamity happening if it were not calamity already happened
BTS Yes but you are not doing that I objected
BTS Dear damp brown hair
BTS A peep at Wolf Larsen showed me that he had not moved
BTS This made Lip-lip the leader and was apparently an honour
BTS In fact it was on Wickson's horses that we had ridden over Sonoma Mountain
BTS To cap it all Wickson's hunting lodge was a quarter of a mile from my hiding-place
BTS A great uproar was raised but he was unsuspected
BTS Johnson I found lying full length on the forecastle head staring at the troubled churn of the forefoot and I remembered with horror the suggestion Wolf Larsen had made
BTS I started after her to stop at the foot of the companion-way
BTS As though animated by a common impulse the onlookers drew back to a respectful distance
BTS And what little there was the slapping of a few reef-points and the creaking of a sheave in a block or two was ghostly under the hollow echoing pall in which we were swathed
BTS There wasn't enough powder in it
BTS Dr
BTS That was why the machine caught him
BTS A woman who earned eighteen hundred dollars a year was worth looking at
BTS to see him in all his certitude and strength shattering their complacency shaking them out of their ruts of thinking
BTS He looked apprehensively about him as though dreading discovery and made an attempt to walk on
BTS p'yed 'ansomely to sling my 'ook an' keep slingin' it
BTS It is precisely what I am doing
BTS And it seemed to me that his eyes were strange not only the expression but the physical seeming as though the optic nerves and supporting muscles had suffered strain and slightly twisted the eyeballs
BTS '  Filled with pretty sentiments and an almighty faith in human illusions
BTS The eyes were large and brown and lustrous the mouth sweet and sensitive and the face itself a delicate oval though sun and exposure to briny wind had burnt the face scarlet
BTS He laid too great stress on what he called the class struggle the antagonism between labor and capital the conflict of interest
BTS The fact man the irrefragable fact
BTS but the relaxed fingers closed tightly and Grey Beaver roused himself
BTS Hard up with that helm
BTS His cunning was wolf cunning and wild cunning
BTS Ah I smiled you advise me to kill neither him nor myself but to let him kill me
BTS The noise from downstairs was as that of a score of battling fiends
BTS Besides consider it a lesson
BTS They move so does the jelly-fish move
BTS but he was not broken
BTS For that matter high-strung and finely sensitive the ill treatment had flung him into a fever which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue
BTS And it was all for him
BTS In the end while Beauty Smith beat White Fang back with a club the mastiff was dragged out by its owner
BTS but he had become more patient than ever and more solicitous
BTS I don't know what happened to the other two
BTS There is nothing clear and sharp and definite about the thought you have expressed
BTS On all sides there was a rending and crashing of wood and steel and canvas
BTS As before it followed him back to earth
BTS To all appearances he looked like a dog that had been strangled to death
BTS He sniffed it curiously then licked some up on his tongue
BTS On the sled in the box lay a third man whose toil was over a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor struggle again
BTS They crisped and crackled like electric sparks
BTS He slept long hours and dreamed much and through his mind passed an unending pageant of Northland visions
BTS The money
BTS Page one hundred and thirty-two I read aloud 'The class struggle therefore presents itself in the present stage of social development between the wage-paying and the wage-paid classes
BTS After this event he found a warmer place in the hearts of the Sierra Vista people and even the groom whose arm he had slashed admitted that he was a wise dog even if he was a wolf
BTS I'll have to cheer him up to-morrow
BTS And all the time she was making outcry and striking with her free wing while feathers were flying like a snow-fall
BTS but he too had become a revolutionist though more disastrously than I for he was already dead and gone and none knew where nor how
BTS John C
BTS They were drunk with conviction of the superiority of their class and of themselves
BTS and also I flattered myself that by look or sign I gave no advertisement of the love I felt for her
BTS I never thought of it in that way before
BTS The middle class is a pygmy between two giants
BTS Now White Fang was not a house-dog nor was he permitted to sleep in the house
BTS Asmunsen nodded
BTS Nay I did more
BTS You might remove the handcuffs he said that night as we stood in consultation over him
BTS Bishop Morehouse presided
BTS From some little port in Madagascar
BTS But greatest of all the advantages in White Fang's favour was his experience
BTS All right Beauty Smith spoke up with the alacrity of fear
BTS The captain had thrust his head and shoulders out of the pilot-house and was staring intently into the fog as though by sheer force of will he could penetrate it
BTS That may serve you in your business but you can't talk to me like that
BTS Taking the sled as the centre of the circle that One Ear was making Bill planned to tap that circle at a point in advance of the pursuit
BTS And at any rate our sort of machine-breaking is at least practical and possible which your dream is not
BTS And through it all the Black Hundreds played their part
BTS He it was I know that carried some of Johnson's hasty talk to Wolf Larsen
BTS At any rate it is only so much more clinching evidence for my book
BTS Shouts of applause went up for the victor and there were many cries of Cherokee
BTS The fall elections were soon to occur and Ernest was nominated by the socialist party to run for Congress
BTS And you are Humphrey Van Weyden she said gazing back at me with equal solemnity and awe
BTS Cry after cry and answering cries were turning the silence into a bedlam
BTS The next mention some days hence will be to the effect that he is suffering from nervous prostration and has been given a vacation by his grateful flock
BTS This passed away as the puppies' antics and mauling continued and he lay with half-shut patient eyes drowsing in the sun
BTS All the boy knew was that he had in some unaccountable way been overturned into the snow and that his club-hand had been ripped wide open by White Fang's teeth
BTS I was delighted with the unselfishness and high idealism I encountered though I was appalled by the vast philosophic and scientific literature of socialism that was opened up to me
BTS But the porcupine squealing and grunting with disrupted anatomy trying feebly to roll up into its ball-protection flicked out its tail again and again the big cat squalled with hurt and astonishment
BTS And toy that I was of this monster the discussion of Omar and the Preacher was resumed
BTS He would go and see
BTS He left his personal feelings at home when he went down to the office
BTS Watch me
BTS The doorways to all the buildings were closed
BTS Here arose dissent
BTS But the pot was beyond arm's length and beside Henry
BTS As I say I was not afraid to meet my own death there a few hundred yards to leeward
BTS My only doctrine is the doctrine of expediency and it makes for surviving
BTS It was by sheer blundering that he chanced upon the shrewdly hidden ptarmigan nest
BTS This first day was made more difficult for me from the fact that the Ghost under close reefs terms such as these I did not learn till later was plunging through what Mr
BTS Once he roused with a start and hastily got the axe out from underneath the lashings
BTS These two defeats had been very disastrous to organized labor
BTS That had given them an unfair advantage
BTS That you are at least consistent was all I could say and I went on washing the dishes
BTS Then he was successful
BTS There were not enough squirrels
BTS And yet I was unafraid
BTS It is the best we can do if we wish to live
BTS He looked at me with a pleased expression and said Really this is fine
BTS She remained always between him and the way he wanted to go
BTS Father in fact was delighted
BTS I asked
BTS Knife just like this
BTS We were in imminent danger of being swamped by the whitecaps
BTS Had they not met accidentally there would not have been any warning
BTS There are two or three standing quarrels in the forecastle
BTS They were merely incredulous that was all
BTS Colonel Ingram was brilliant at cross-examination
BTS There was perfect quiet in the room
BTS The bottom's likely to drop out at any moment
BTS I gave him rest--he who worked so hard for others my dear tired-eyed mortalist
BTS The Law of Club and Fang Buck's first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare
BTS I was feeling sick and squeamish and sat down on a bench
BTS You'll get down out of that rigging and damn lively about it
BTS she asked sleepily and withal curiously
BTS And the California Mercenaries were in reality the most faithful of all to their salt
BTS He's the boy'll fix 'em
BTS Once his teeth closed on the fore leg of a husky and he crunched down through the bone
BTS Or again he would be in the pen of Beauty Smith
BTS And it's you that asks me
BTS What could he say
BTS What is done with it
BTS Henry rolled over angrily on his side but was surprised that Bill made no similar display of temper
BTS White Fang shrank together and grew tense as he crouched under it
BTS It was inexplicable
BTS And twice again we came down the path burdened with skins till I thought we had enough to roof the hut
BTS I here give the fragment not alone because he loved it but because it epitomized the paradox that he was in the spirit of him and his conception of his spirit
BTS But I knew and his genius and my judgment were vindicated when he made that magnificent hit with his Forge
BTS The man's mine and I'll make soup of him and eat it if I want to
BTS If she were heading south-west as Johnson had said the wind then I calculated was blowing nearly from the south
BTS He really looked stupid
BTS Scott could only look in wonder
BTS for we returned at one o'clock rested and strengthened by a hearty dinner
BTS That was on the second day
BTS I understood the mechanics of levers
BTS They are in most of the great railways radiating from Chicago
BTS But Ernest never gave quarter to an enemy
BTS Sorry the domination of Aristotle's thought
BTS Strike-breakers--these were in purpose and practice and everything except name the private soldiers of the capitalists
BTS By the light of the lantern I saw the butt twist slowly around till its sides coincided with the sides of the step
BTS He couldn't a-done it himself that's sure
BTS Of course there's lots that's repugnant in the course of the day's work
BTS Because he was less brave than God
BTS The boat was now very close and I could make out plainly that it was lying head to wind and sea and dragging on its mast and sail which had been thrown overboard and made to serve as a sea-anchor
BTS I gave him rest
BTS He never allowed them any latitude
BTS Disabled in that typhoon
BTS But what a furor was raised in the local papers
BTS The fine hand of the Iron Heel was apparent in every column
BTS but the poor wretch was weeping again over his misfortunes
BTS He did not propose
BTS His face and neck were hidden beneath a black beard intershot with grey which would have been stiff and bushy had it not been limp and draggled and dripping with water
BTS Easy Johansen
BTS I followed them intently fixing up my hair at the same time and pinning together my torn skirts
BTS There were no takers
BTS 2
BTS But when White Fang stopped without orders then it was allowed them to spring upon him and destroy him if they could
BTS He scrutinized me keenly and was half convinced then shook his head and would not believe
BTS He was rarely really angry
BTS I don't know one of them frankly said
BTS He studied the wood-mice and tried to dig them out of their burrows
BTS Eat 'm up
BTS Then he wormed his way forward slowly toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates
BTS His early training when he fought with Lip-lip and the whole puppy-pack stood him in good stead
BTS It was a harness store we found ourselves in and he fixed me up a couch of horse blankets in the private office well to the rear
BTS Mr
BTS They had no chance to make a break for liberty in one of the boats
BTS In the morning Henry was aroused by fervid blasphemy that proceeded from the mouth of Bill
BTS It might have been that he took no notice because he was heavy with sleep
BTS Maud had finished her task and come aft where she stood beside me a small cap perched on her wind-blown hair her cheeks flushed from exertion her eyes wide and bright with the excitement her nostrils quivering to the rush and bite of the fresh salt air
BTS We've made at least ten knots and we're going twelve or thirteen now
BTS He never ran to meet his god
BTS Thereafter they spoke no more though their ears were keen for the hunting-cries that continued to rise behind them
BTS I had looked for almost any sort of explosion on the Cockney's part but to my surprise he did not appear aware of what I was doing
BTS And then he awoke to find the howling real
BTS I asked
BTS and the bull-dog promptly shifted his grip getting in closer mangling more and more of the fur-folded flesh throttling White Fang more severely than ever
BTS It drew him as the light in the mouth of the cave had drawn him in his early puppyhood
BTS Then he began to laugh derisively and scornfully
BTS Hammerfield who said It is when their thinking is wrong that they are asked to resign
BTS A puff slightly stronger than usual struck us just then
BTS And to them I resolved to go
BTS He swam directly to the beach and clambered out into a small opening between two harems the masters of which made warning noises but did not attack him
BTS I do not understand I said
BTS He halted with equal abruptness and gasped
BTS Of course my philosophy had always recognized the inevitableness of the love-call sooner or later
BTS It was most amusing
BTS A number of men however who were lounging about a companion-way between the galley and hatch and who did not seem to be sailors continued talking in low tones with one another
BTS Calvin shook a troubled head
BTS But he stood motionless and staring as before
BTS and that freight cars have been burned by employers' agents during railroad strikes in order to increase disorder
BTS A little later he made the end of the gaff where astride the spar itself he had a better chance for holding on
BTS But there is I objected
BTS And now
BTS Here the shouting and the cries of Order
BTS His shoulders relaxed and drooping and his head on his knees advertised that he had given up the struggle
BTS Smoke ho
BTS We are not going to die
BTS it was the sum of the terrors of the unknown the one culminating and unthinkable catastrophe that could happen to him about which he knew nothing and about which he feared everything
BTS And he did it out of sheer love of man and for man he gave his life and was crucified
BTS Yes I said
BTS Such was the lesson that was quickly borne in upon him
BTS To such an extent was he tormented that he hated blindly and without the faintest spark of reason
BTS Primitive man was a combinative beast and because of it he rose to primacy over all the animals
BTS In a way he was prepared to do this
BTS That was the man Buck divined the next tormentor and he hurled himself savagely against the bars
BTS But there was one lesson the dogs did learn and that was to keep together
BTS On the other hand it was held that a simultaneous jail-delivery all over the land would have immense psychological influence on the proletariat
BTS and from the poop we watched him turn and start aft on our track
BTS The mother called them to her and comforted them telling them not to bother White Fang
BTS There was the awfulness of retribution about it
BTS I had noted the men in the forecastle
BTS Calvin's face lighted up
BTS There was no clew to that tragedy of the air
BTS In the ebb of their fortunes this sum was their total capital
BTS How could I explain to her the situation the strange man who stalked the sea like Destiny all that it had taken me months to learn
BTS But I thought I marked a change in him a short while back
BTS And in the day that we sweep to victory at the ballot-box and you refuse to turn over to us the government we have constitutionally and peacefully captured and you demand what we are going to do about it--in that day I say we shall answer you
BTS I'll bet you a month's pay he acts upon it
BTS Joe was snapping like a demon
BTS He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and said Then you're thinkin' as it was  A long wailing cry fiercely sad from somewhere in the darkness had interrupted him
BTS Now that he is dead I am free to speak
BTS It was the first time I had ever heard Karl Marx's doctrine of surplus value elaborated and Ernest had done it so simply that I too sat puzzled and dumbfounded
BTS Who Has Won to Mastership Eh
BTS He was transferred from one part of the country to another
BTS She took charge of him lifting his head to keep the blood out of it and despatching me to the cabin for a pillow
BTS Get up there
BTS In the meantime they're willin' to pick up anything eatable that comes handy
BTS I am quite crushed Ernest murmured meekly
BTS but the Republican and Democratic members sneered and jeered at him and there was uproar and confusion
BTS For an hour I saw nothing but the naked desolate sea
BTS the trusts have them both coming and going
BTS Calvin said
BTS I don't know but it is there somewhere
BTS As Spencer says the data of any particular science are partially unified knowledge
BTS Henry he said
BTS As Wolf Larsen bent down to the lower bunk to take Johnson's pulse I standing erect and holding the lamp saw Leach's head rise stealthily as he peered over the side of his bunk to see what was going on
BTS When the proclaimed date arrived half a million soldiers were sent into the mountainous districts everywhere
BTS In the summers there is one visitor however to that valley of which the Yeehats do not know
BTS But she divined the mockery in Wolf Larsen's words and again favoured me with a sympathetic glance
BTS The faint sound of Thornton's voice came to them and though they could not make out the words of it they knew that he was in his extremity
BTS That it should be as vital as possible it required no more than that the woman should be Maud Brewster who now charmed me in person as she had long charmed me through her work
BTS Boats were continually being lost and found it being the custom for a boat to hunt on lay with whatever schooner picked it up until such time it was recovered by its own schooner
BTS Furthermore we charge that the Iron Heel was guilty of the outrage and that the Iron Heel planned and perpetrated the outrage for the purpose of foisting the guilt on our shoulders and so bringing about our destruction
BTS The abysmal brute would roar anyway and the police and Mercenaries would slay anyway
BTS I reached my hand and felt for his
BTS The conversation turned upon the Bishop and we got Ernest to explain what he had been doing with him
BTS He took his book and turned back several pages
BTS All of which is neither here nor there
BTS That the American Mrs
BTS This rush was never completed
BTS So great was his speed that as he curved past the corner of the cabin he slipped and fell
BTS Only a set-back a delay
BTS He heard the shrill voices of the women the gruff basses of the men and the snarling of the dogs
BTS Bound by bound he gained
BTS Thus we see that the slavery that exists in America was founded in right
BTS And finally I am convinced that he is the perfect type of the primitive man born a thousand years or generations too late and an anachronism in this culminating century of civilization
BTS Because he's comin'
BTS I demanded angrily
BTS The indecisiveness or feebleness of his movements was more pronounced
BTS of my brothers who went away one by one to the deep-sea farming and never came back
BTS The rest of the men were morose and silent
BTS Yet his conclusions were as sharp and distinct as those achieved by men
BTS The skin roof stretched tightly as a drumhead I had thought sagged and bellied with every gust
BTS and Buck had memories of nights of vigil spent beneath trees wherein the hairy man roosted holding on tightly as he slept
BTS So I did not wait a second time for Maud to send me
BTS Wolf Larsen did not laugh though his grey eyes lighted with a slight glint of amusement
BTS In the south-west and almost in our course I saw the pyramidal loom of some vessel's sails
BTS She looked penitent
BTS You see you fellows have studied business in a small way but you have not studied social evolution at all
BTS Oh Humphrey she sobbed when will it all end
BTS Didn't Lang include your Kiss Endured' among the four supreme sonnets by women in the English language
BTS That's a lie Wolf Larsen I said just as quietly as before
BTS while Billee the good-natured with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons cried and whimpered throughout the night
BTS He certainly was of a superior kind
BTS Parsons took the wheel and the pursuit continued
BTS And you know that I would kill an unarmed man as readily as I would smoke a cigar he went on
BTS And if you want to laugh at me you have my consent and forgiveness
BTS Buck did not cry out
BTS When I asked them flatly to assist Jackson they as flatly refused
BTS The lazarette was directly beneath the cabin and opening the trap-door in the floor and carrying a candle with me I dropped down and began overhauling the ship's stores
BTS I don't think he answered quickly
BTS But I've said nothin' to ye mind ye
BTS and as he spoke I remembered the last dividend that had been paid my father and the pretty gown for me and the books for him that had been bought out of that dividend
BTS How in hell did he know it was you in the dark
BTS for anything
BTS Between pain and pressure I fainted
BTS Next he must act for the benefit of his children
BTS I cried
BTS I believed my eyes without question and yet I was for the moment stunned by what they disclosed to me
BTS What can we say now
BTS He ran back to her licked her face and ran on again
BTS Then let me explain
BTS It breathed of power
BTS but Buck knew and every dog knew what had taken place behind the belt of river trees
BTS He got them or got away himself untouched in either event
BTS To the north I could see the loom of Sonoma Mountain toward which we rode
BTS The facts of life took on a fiercer aspect
BTS All this and more a whole world of chaos and wreck in possibly fifteen seconds I had seen and heard and grasped
BTS Avis Everhard took for granted that her narrative would be read in her own day and so omits to mention the outcome of the trial for high treason
BTS I too had been groping and floundering the while I thought I rode clear-eyed through the mystery
BTS They alone moved through the vast inertness
BTS He had bred true to the straight wolf-stock in fact he had bred true to old One Eye himself physically with but a single exception and that was he had two eyes to his father's one
BTS They composed one of the boats' crews and their task was to ply between the schooner and the shore carrying a single cask each trip
BTS And I stated that from these two facts no other conclusion was possible than that the capitalist class had mismanaged
BTS I confess that a madness seized me that I shrieked aloud as the women had shrieked and beat the water with my numb hands
BTS This secret service for the enemy must hamper him a lot but it's better than lying in a refuge
BTS Command followed command
BTS well I wasn't my own boss any more
BTS Van W'yden but I do know I'll never rest 'appy till I see that 'ell-'ound bloody well dead
BTS and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole he would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs
BTS The dog-musher swore softly in awe-stricken accents
BTS Where's the pot
BTS But I wish to have you comfortable before I start
BTS He walked to the door of his room saying And now Mr
BTS It is unfortunate we haven't plenty of ammunition but I think anyway that they suffer less from being clubbed than from being all shot up
BTS Larsen I answered weakly
BTS Good-bye Lucifer I whispered to myself as I softly closed the door
BTS But there was nothing
BTS He shook his head sadly murmuring Too bad too bad while the hunters burst into guffaws of laughter
BTS Grey Beaver made mouth-noises which White Fang interpreted as not hostile so he came still nearer
BTS You don't get no coffee Henry announced
BTS He drew himself inboard with a quick effort and arose to his feet glancing swiftly as he did so at the man at the wheel as though to assure himself of his identity and that there was nothing to fear from him
BTS The troops we had fallen in with had held it back on the west
BTS I am to lie she said in steady rebellious tones by speech and action to lie
BTS The reporter merely dropped out social
BTS Before his earnestness conventional maiden dignity was ridiculous
BTS Weedon Scott reading the letter down in Circle City came upon the following That dam wolf won't work
BTS As one is afraid of a snake or a tiger or a shark
BTS the cry came down the open companion-way
BTS His talk was very true and good and I have never forgotten
BTS Of course here and there farmers and even whole communities of farmers escaped expropriation by virtue of exceptional conditions
BTS When I tried to pin him down to what my home life had to do with swerving the university from its high ideal he offered me a two years' vacation on full pay in Europe for recreation and research

BTS The Plutocracy owns sixty-seven billions of wealth
BTS The wooded knolls are the same knolls referred to by Avis Everhard
BTS CHAPTER XXIV Among the most vivid memories of my life are those of the events on the Ghost which occurred during the forty hours succeeding the discovery of my love for Maud Brewster
BTS As I say the sight gratified me
BTS But on the other hand you are being eaten up in turn by the bigger dogs wherefore you squeal
BTS His cowardly rages made them dread a shot in the back or poison in their coffee
BTS Night had fallen
BTS I looked closely but was not sure until exclamations broke out on all sides
BTS Of course a wolf that knows enough to come in with the dogs at feedin' time 'd know all about shooting-irons
BTS He described the international organization of the socialists that united the million and a half in the United States with the twenty-three millions and a half in the rest of the world
BTS But in the end Buck's pertinacity was rewarded
BTS This is the end of the Everhard Manuscript
BTS There was a great deal of effort about their manner but no businesslike method
BTS Bellying forward to the edge of the clearing he found Hans lying on his face feathered with arrows like a porcupine
BTS I was not thinking of taking them aboard when I made that promise he answered
BTS It was as though I were about to see a new and awful revelation of life
BTS Holy smoke
BTS It was he who snarled warningly at the younger members of the pack or slashed at them with his fangs when they ambitiously tried to pass him
BTS I felt quite stiff across the small of the back so much so that I straightened up with an effort and with pain
BTS The dark sun-bronze of his face went black with wrath his eyes were ablaze
BTS When I returned from throwing them overside he was talking to Harrison whose honest yokel's face was filled with fascination and wonder
BTS T'row down de club Perrault commanded
BTS He tells me that the day we were rescued even while I was in the cabin two men were drowned deliberately drowned murdered
BTS I have worked I do work I cried impetuously as though he were my judge and I required vindication and at the same time very much aware of my arrant idiocy in discussing the subject at all
BTS that is why sir
BTS But a fountain of blood was gushing forth
BTS And none of them knew how to fight
BTS Sol-leks the one-eyed still faithful to the toil of trace and trail and mournful in that he had so little strength with which to pull
BTS The second dog-watch and the day were wound up by a fight between Johansen and the lean Yankee-looking hunter Latimer
BTS I saw him go for'ard a little while ago
BTS But his hugeness could not quite overcome his apprehensiveness
BTS By 1895 they controlled one-fifth of the railway mileage of the country
BTS and I am afraid in my mind because I do not wish to die
BTS My lawyers and agents had taken care of my money for me
BTS It was at the Philomath Club--a wonderful night of battle wherein Ernest bearded the masters in their lair
BTS And the best of it was that released from the weight of expedite the balloon shot up into the air and did not come down for half a dozen miles both heroes escaping unharmed
BTS And furthermore the working class can do better without you than with you
BTS It was a cold-blooded exhibition of marksmanship
BTS White Fang's backers were correspondingly depressed and refused bets of ten to one and twenty to one though one man was rash enough to close a wager of fifty to one
BTS White Fang heard it first and he was bristling with recognition while Grey Beaver still nodded stupidly
BTS Think so
BTS And out of the dividends magnificent churches are builded in New England wherein your kind preaches pleasant platitudes to the sleek full-bellied recipients of those dividends
BTS In consequence his forearm was ripped open to the bone
BTS It was the afternoon that the master was to ride and White Fang knew it
BTS They strained to catch some interruption of the silence and immobility of nature
BTS As the hand descended closer and closer there raged within the cub a battle of the instincts
BTS Wait till I get back to Dawson Beauty Smith threatened
BTS It has always been insisted that Ghent put the idea of the Oligarchy into the minds of the great capitalists
BTS Even though the Pervaise confession had never come to light no reasonable doubt could obtain
BTS Gad sir
BTS Two billions
BTS The cry of this army is 'No quarter
BTS Bill opened his mouth to speak but changed his mind
BTS I pulled in the oars and bent forward to the line which held the tow
BTS CHAPTER XXIV NIGHTMARE I had not closed my eyes the night before on the Twentieth Century and what of that and of my exhaustion I slept soundly
BTS For no other reason did Rudolph Mendenhall flame out his soul for the Cause and sing his wild swan-song that last night of life
BTS Now it won't explode at all
BTS You enjoy it
BTS Mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs being too occupied with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and brother
BTS Asmunsen remarked
BTS 'You hardly behave as if your purse had been touched she said smilingly
BTS This man a pillar of the church and heavy contributor to foreign missions worked his shop girls ten hours a day on a starvation wage and thereby directly encouraged prostitution
BTS The master came to the door and called White Fang inside
BTS but golden his eyes were enticing and masterful at the same time luring and compelling and speaking a demand and clamour of the blood which no woman much less Maud Brewster could misunderstand
BTS And anyway you'll agree I've not laid my hands upon them
BTS In Sacramento the capital of California the Grangers had succeeded in maintaining order
BTS Yes
BTS Two of our boats with men all safe we took off the Cisco and to Wolf Larsen's huge delight and my own grief he culled Smoke with Nilson and Leach from the San Diego
BTS Dynamite appeared
BTS And so I gazed upon Maud's light-brown hair and loved it and learned more of love than all the poets and singers had taught me with all their songs and sonnets
BTS and Wolf Larsen paused once or twice at the break of the poop to glance curiously at what must have been to him a stirring and crawling of the yeasty thing he knew as life
BTS Ain't bleedin' much Matt announced
BTS The quiet buildings looked down upon the scene from their many windows
BTS At any moment they were liable to be overwhelmed by the hissing combers
BTS Colonel Ingram rose high in the Oligarchy and became Minister to Germany
BTS They dropped that private car when the papers came aboard
BTS Send a man to the wheel Mr
BTS She waited for me to go on
BTS There was Judge Scott and there was his wife
BTS You're going in for grab-sharing
BTS Whenever we approached such localities the guards turned us back and sent us around
BTS CHAPTER XXV THE TERRORISTS It was not until Ernest and I were back in New York and after weeks had elapsed that we were able to comprehend thoroughly the full sweep of the disaster that had befallen the Cause
BTS God pity those three regiments
BTS You can no more make water run up hill than can you cause the tide of economic evolution to flow back in its channel along the way it came
BTS 'Ow Gawd must 'ave 'ated me w'en 'e signed me on for a voyage in this bloomin' world of 'is
BTS Hammerfield snorted
BTS What is your name
BTS Cooky did that he laughed again
BTS It was not until in the last century that Lorbia the brilliant Italian scholar stumbled upon it quite by chance during his researches in the Vatican
BTS And to save his face he turned fiercely upon the onlookers
BTS It is the tradition that he died of starvation in solitary confinement and this harsh treatment is explained as having been caused by his uncompromising stubbornness and his fiery and tactless hatred for all men that served the despotism
BTS And suiting the action to the words he closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair
BTS But nobody else ever romped with White Fang
BTS These men had been long in the country
BTS of fish diet and coarse living
BTS All the old memories and associations died down again and passed into the grave from which they had been resurrected
BTS We saw the end of the young officer who had rescued us
BTS It came to me that we were at the head of the column
BTS Let us gather tundra grass and thatch the roof Maud said
BTS But they are in the air now to-day
BTS Only one sister remained to him
BTS There is one green hand in the crew Harrison by name a clumsy-looking country boy mastered I imagine by the spirit of adventure and making his first voyage
BTS It was at Wake Robin Lodge that Avis Everhard later lived for short periods when disguised as an agent-provocateur of the Iron Heel she was enabled to play with impunity her part among men and events
BTS However I continued Miss Brewster is right in contending that temptation is temptation whether the man yield or overcome
BTS CHAPTER VIII THE MACHINE BREAKERS It was just before Ernest ran for Congress on the socialist ticket that father gave what he privately called his Profit and Loss dinner
BTS Though he suffered most of the damage and was always defeated his spirit remained unsubdued
BTS Of all persons in occupations seventy per cent come from the proletariat
BTS and a third seven hundred
BTS And we had been compelled to row in a dead calm practically every inch of the way
BTS I met men incoherent with indignation at the brutality of prize-fighting and who at the same time were parties to the adulteration of food that killed each year more babes than even red-handed Herod had killed
BTS A sordid harsh and meagre life it must have been
BTS After the first surprise of greeting was over the Bishop leaned back in his chair stretched out his overall-covered legs and actually sighed a comfortable sigh
BTS All halting utterance vanished
BTS I'm not saying that if I'd got the right kind of testimony out of their witnesses on cross-examination that friendship would have decided the case
BTS You'll never see eighteen again
BTS Dr
BTS I who could have bought them out bag and baggage and the schooner and its equipment a score of times over
BTS he saw to the welfare of his as if they were his own children because he could not help it
BTS The automobile containing the officer who had asked the question darted on
BTS An' I wisht this cold snap'd break he went on
BTS The next moment the wretched man had wrenched free from his captors and flung himself at my feet his arms clutching me about the knees in a vicelike grip as he prayed in a frenzy for mercy
BTS In the afternoon he blundered upon a ptarmigan
BTS we must dissimulate and win if win we can by craft
BTS I picked up a seal-club
BTS One and all the professors the preachers and the editors hold their jobs by serving the Plutocracy and their service consists of propagating only such ideas as are either harmless to or commendatory of the Plutocracy
BTS Bah
BTS The red-faced man had said that the tide was ebbing through the Golden Gate
BTS The weasel was a drinker of blood and it was ever her preference to drink from the throat of life itself
BTS Ernest had to repeat his question before Mr
BTS You know I was travelling to Japan for my health she said as we lingered at the fire after dinner and delighted in the movelessness of loafing
BTS You've only got three cartridges an' there's no tellin' what might happen
BTS John Thornton asked little of man or nature
BTS Since when have you become a philanthropist
BTS I don't care-- I began indignantly but Ernest interrupted
BTS And there it was again the division of labour the special knowledge of the pilot and captain which permitted the stout gentleman to read my special knowledge on Poe while they carried him safely from Sausalito to San Francisco
BTS and that it must come from wealthy personages who could not but be offended by the swerving of the university from its high ideal of the passionless pursuit of passionless intelligence
BTS This strength we cannot be stripped of
BTS I had read sea-romances in my time wherein figured as a matter of course the lone woman in the midst of a shipload of men
BTS Your father
BTS A puff of wind caught me and I staggered across the moving deck to a corner of the cabin to which I clung for support
BTS This in itself did not amount to much
BTS There was no greeting
BTS He was very much afraid
BTS Take a turn he said quietly to the man
BTS Are you fishing
BTS my father asked and I could see that it was likewise new to him
BTS How moch
BTS Yes I have was his reply
BTS Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with Buck who in a dying condition was unable to resent her first advances
BTS There was about him no consciousness of sin
BTS The wind puffed strongly and the Ghost heeled far over burying her lee rail
BTS To his astonishment they had disappeared
BTS Labor can and will rule the world
BTS I asked
BTS I'll wager Dr
BTS They wept over the miseries of the past and over the miseries yet to come under the iron rule of Wolf Larsen
BTS The last place in the world the spies of the Iron Heel would dream of looking for me and for Ernest when he joined me was Wickson's deer-park
BTS Twenty feet away towered a huge dead spruce
BTS It was painted black and from the talk of the hunters of their poaching exploits I recognized it as a United States revenue cutter
BTS Their strength was used to give united strength to the Oligarchy
BTS To keep one's feet in the midst of the hostile mass meant life and this he learnt well
BTS And Perrault nodded
BTS I began as a little lad on the spindles
BTS The thing to expect of them was the unexpected and for this he must be prepared
BTS And I too was mad
BTS As long as workingmen and capitalists exist they will continue to quarrel over the division
BTS Beauty Smith enjoyed the task
BTS Two other dead guards marked his trail through the prison to the outer walls and he had killed with his hands to avoid noise
BTS The capitalist class has mismanaged
BTS I ran in close and struck another blow hitting the shoulder instead of the head
BTS No truer more loyal man ever labored for the Cause
BTS The Iron Heel has won
BTS Other comrades took charge of me
BTS In this connection I cannot forbear relating my first experience with a boarding sea
BTS Alas how we underestimated the strength of the enemy
BTS Thank you sir was all he said as he slipped back into the darkness
BTS Henry propped himself up on an elbow and looked to see his comrade standing among the dogs beside the replenished fire his arms raised in objurgation his face distorted with passion
BTS And in the course of the long journey with Grey Beaver he walked softly indeed amongst the full-grown dogs in the camps of the strange man-animals they encountered
BTS He was aroused by her snarling
BTS I flung his words at him
BTS I say Hump's improving don't you think so
BTS His fellow-socialists could not agree with him
BTS One at a time he repeated softly
BTS He noticed that his cup was empty and started to reach for the pot
BTS Once it tottered about to fall back but the broken hold was regained and it still went up
BTS How's it strike you
BTS and the tiredness would pass out of his eyes and into them would flood the happy love-light that was in itself a new and sufficient advertisement of his immortality
BTS He did not know what to do it was all so unprecedented
BTS At midday not only did the sun warm the southern horizon but it even thrust its upper rim pale and golden above the sky-line
BTS I'll be case-hardened by that time was his reply
BTS Denied help from his friends such as father and Ernest and I could have given he was left to battle for himself alone
BTS But this boldness that I took to be presumption was a vital clew to the nature of Ernest Everhard
BTS And then one night he escaped
BTS Since you are not yet case-hardened tell me what you think right now about the general editorial policy
BTS By some freak of pressures his frail body had snapped the strong man's leg like a pipe-stem
BTS He yielded to the master's children with an ill but honest grace and endured their fooling as one would endure a painful operation
BTS Johnson the man who had chafed me raw when I first came aboard seemed the least equivocal of the men forward or aft
BTS Lift up that end there damn you
BTS He had never experienced the hurt of a fall
BTS The desires for the good grub and soft beds ashore which a handsome pay-day brings them the women and the drink the gorging and the beastliness which so truly expresses them the best that is in them their highest aspirations their ideals if you please
BTS Wolf Larsen and the lantern disappeared and we were left in darkness
BTS And whom have I to thank for this kindness
BTS I had looked upon it as a simple task what of the oars mast boom and sprit to say nothing of plenty of lines
BTS It was the endurance of his mind that kept him going
BTS I was incapable of speaking my mind was too confused
BTS It is because I am afraid the flesh is afraid
BTS He bled freely but showed no signs of being disconcerted
BTS The company employs very efficient lawyers you know
BTS Go home
BTS Then he and the crate in which he was imprisoned began a passage through many hands
BTS This was certainly better than the life he had lived in the cage of Beauty Smith and it was necessary that he should have some god
BTS A pair of workman's brogans encased my feet and for trousers I was furnished with a pair of pale blue washed-out overalls one leg of which was fully ten inches shorter than the other
BTS The cub knew only that the sniff was strange a something unclassified therefore unknown and terrible for the unknown was one of the chief elements that went into the making of fear
BTS He hauled the rope up and hid it and before he went away called down to me a cheerful parting
BTS The grey light of day that remained lasted until three o'clock when it too faded and the pall of the Arctic night descended upon the lone and silent land
BTS And they said it was all the fault of the machines
BTS I bespeak the privilege then of enlightening him in jurisprudence Biedenbach cried
BTS I know I can see it you have among other ways been used to managing people with your eyes letting your moral courage speak out through them as it were
BTS We extended this process to all the countries on the planet till every country was producing every year and every day an unconsumed surplus which it could dispose of to no other country
BTS And having commanded he went aft with his peculiar tigerish leaps to the wheel
BTS He quite ignored my presence though I credited him with being simply unable to see me
BTS I know it I said hoarsely
BTS Let him go I say he repeated
BTS I am sincere with my soul at least and that is what you are not
BTS He had lessoned from Spitz and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail and knew there was no middle course
BTS But the pack invariably lost him
BTS In his confession he states explicitly that he was informed that the bomb was to be a feeble thing and that no lives would be lost
BTS Peter Donnelly the scab foreman at the Sierra Mills whom I encountered while investigating the case of Jackson was a surprise to all of us
BTS The grey cub would have died and there would have been no story to write about him had not the she-wolf come bounding through the bushes
BTS 3 boat and Johnson and Leach were missing
BTS This time as we went into the trough of the sea and were swept there were no sails to carry away
BTS In that moment I could have put my arms around her and drawn her to me
BTS And you know me as I am generally known
BTS He looked at the master and he looked at the dogs
BTS She was Charles's wife and Hal's sister a nice family party
BTS The capitalists have stolen our country debauched our politics defiled our judiciary and ridden over us rough-shod and now they propose to murder those who will not abjectly surrender to their brutal dominion
BTS There were many of us in the various secret services of the Oligarchy and despite the shakings-up and reorganizations the secret services have undergone they have never been able to weed all of us out
BTS The weakness in their position lies in that they are merely business men
BTS I did not dream that work was so terrible a thing
BTS She was comparatively dry but she was numb with the cold
BTS Wolf Larsen called out
BTS We had greater capital
BTS It was an inevitable concomitant of the subterranean warfare that raged through those three centuries
BTS The vision of her as I had last seen her in the lantern light of the schooner's hold her brown eyes warm and moist with joy flashed before me and I knew that I could not go back
BTS He had been waiting for this
BTS This was the startling effect of the cessation of motion
BTS yet beyond weird and haunting fragments of his verse quoted in the writings of others nothing of his has come down to us
BTS I think even the hunters are appalled at his cold-bloodedness
BTS And in so far as the Church does not protest it condones for remember the Church is supported by the capitalist class
BTS Here there was a stir of dissent around the table
BTS But his answer was serious nay solemn
BTS Is it yours
BTS Even the protest of Standish arose out of the fact that he did not wish to lose his boat-puller
BTS The grip had been joined by two large canvas bags and a box
BTS It was a pursuit like unto that of the Universal Solvent of the mediaeval alchemists
BTS Hammerfield demanded and already there was something unpleasant in his voice and manner of utterance
BTS Their attitude toward him was so broadly tolerant and kindly that it was really patronizing
BTS And secondly the law was rushed through Congress and the Senate secretly with practically no discussion
BTS It was a perfect hiding-place
BTS The reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution
BTS Put him under the X-ray anything
BTS And then I said Twenty-seven years old and still free and fancy free
BTS I countered
BTS Then I looked at Wolf Larsen but there was nothing subjective about his state of consciousness
BTS He had met Ernest shortly prior to the preacher's night
BTS The people who had owned the soil had been driven away
BTS Few things could have been more to their liking than to give him a tow over the side for to the forecastle he had sent messes and concoctions of the vilest order
BTS So he turned tail philosophically and trotted on up the stream
BTS but it always recovered itself and in the main behaved satisfactorily
BTS It was so thick in the confined space that I was compelled to feel my way
BTS and the very conventionality of her tones and words with the host of associations it aroused of the old life on the other side of the world gave me a quick thrill rich with remembrance but stinging sharp with home-sickness
BTS Maud cried jubilantly
BTS After that he left that part of the country and journeyed over to the valley wherein he had been born
BTS I almost loved him then though I am confident had I never seen him again that the vague feelings would have passed away and that I should easily have forgotten him
BTS I queried
BTS for this man's body had become his mausoleum
BTS Not I he laughed back
BTS 'I hope you are happy
BTS No one knew his first name and in general he was known in the country as Beauty Smith
BTS The large capitalists the trusts in short will not let you turn back
BTS A sailor comes aft to take mate's place cabin-boy goes for'ard to take sailor's place and you take the cabin-boy's place sign the articles for the cruise twenty dollars per month and found
BTS It was his first glimpse of mankind
BTS I was growing excited but she interrupted me with an Oh I see and her voice sounded weary
BTS What did you expect
BTS Bravo
BTS Or if you will the sum of his desires is his soul
BTS then becoming interested he had drifted on into economics and sociology
BTS ' you are crying
BTS His dear tired eyes
BTS Deef I am and dumb as ye should be for the sake iv your mother
BTS You can't expect 'm to come out a white an' shinin' angel
BTS The police had broken countless heads with their riot clubs
BTS They were slashed open and bleeding before they knew what had happened were whipped almost before they had begun to fight
BTS The Mercenaries were killing without quarter
BTS and for two days and nights Buck neither ate nor drank
BTS The stockholders furnish the capital
BTS There must have been a touch of the melodramatic in my pose and voice for Maud smiled
BTS Jim Hall said Judge Scott and father and son looked significantly at each other
BTS No
BTS To-morrow when the Great Revolt breaks out and all the world resounds with the tramp tramp of the millions the Oligarchy will realize and too late how mightily that band of heroes has grown
BTS Down
BTS Johnson must have joined him immediately so that his abject and grovelling conduct on deck for the past few days had been no more than planned deception
BTS but what it was he could not discover
BTS The eyes of both of us I think were moist with the joy of success
BTS And every day thereafter found him out and ranging a wider area
BTS And then blind and reeling he followed at Beauty Smith's heels back to the fort
BTS He had expected all hell to break loose and here it was
BTS Not a word could I get from him concerning the trial and his testimony
BTS He had become enamoured of proletarian life
BTS Henry looked at him commiseratingly and said I'll be almighty glad when this trip's over
BTS One and all you tell the same story--the passing away of competition and the coming on of combination
BTS While the sight of a moose-bird almost invariably put him into the wildest of rages
BTS They assimilated the aristocratic idea from the moment they began as children to receive impressions of the world
BTS It is only nervousness she answered
BTS I remember my father giving me a dollar once when I was a little girl for remaining absolutely quiet for five minutes
BTS At that time he was a mere puppy soft from the making without form ready for the thumb of circumstance to begin its work upon him
BTS His mother's movements were restricted to the length of a stick and by the length of that same stick was he restricted for he had not yet got beyond the need of his mother's side
BTS It is the brain of the Plutocracy that controls the government and this brain consists of seven small and powerful groups of men
BTS I had learned of the device from the talk of the hunters and it was a simple thing to manufacture
BTS And as he left me I was aware of the same desire at my heart
BTS We would not be so foolish
BTS Ernest sprang out
BTS Here debauched a deep gorge with precipitous volcanic walls which no man could scale
BTS Not at all I denied valiantly
BTS It is the primitive strength it is the strength that is to life germane it is the strength that is stronger than wealth and that wealth cannot take away
BTS This White Fang quickly discovered by mixing with those that came ashore with their masters
BTS There's that fake train in front of us
BTS The afternoon would show far more accomplished
BTS In the labor troubles of the first decade of the twentieth century A
BTS I am planted too solidly and stolidly upon the earth
BTS Thornton's command cracked out like a pistol-shot
BTS He was in a rage himself a sane rage
BTS She was following my advice
BTS When the beating was over White Fang was sick
BTS His whole body was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort the muscles writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur
BTS Only
BTS How many books have been suppressed
BTS My mind recoils from contemplation of what they may crystallize into
BTS Francois came up last after the sled and load
BTS and in the darkness Henry went about preparing breakfast while Bill rolled the blankets and made the sled ready for lashing
BTS A log fell apart with a loud spluttering noise
BTS Oh many a Cup of this forbidden Wine Must drown the memory of that insolence
BTS And so I say-- But at this point H
BTS I could hear them crying out to one another
BTS For centuries the Wild had stood for terror and destruction
BTS My brain grew clearer and I turned as I ran and looked at the man who was holding me up
BTS The sailors assembled in a fearful group just outside the forecastle scuttle and watched and listened
BTS At first in a mild way he had dabbled in philosophy
BTS I'll tell you what I'll do he challenged finally
BTS But Wolf Larsen seemed voluble prone to speech as I had never seen him before
BTS Here is a shoe factory
BTS He loved to play Chinese lottery
BTS If we can do all this in a premature isolated abortive attempt what can't we do in a concerted ripened effort all over the land
BTS But the god made no hostile movement and went on calmly talking
BTS Supper was at hand and the table not laid
BTS Its function is to serve the established by moulding public opinion and right well it serves it
BTS Ask him something that requires no for an answer I suggested
BTS But how was Chicago shut off from the rest of the world to know
BTS Jackson I could not escape
BTS Wolf Larsen put the wheel hard up to port and we began to pay off
BTS This we knew for we still maintained our night-watches
BTS The other mug was fixed plenty
BTS An outcast himself from the pack of the part-grown dogs his sanguinary methods and remarkable efficiency made the pack pay for its persecution of him
BTS You will observe Miss Brewster that he carries a dirk in his belt a ahem a most unusual thing for a ship's officer to do
BTS He tried to take White Fang's meat an' he's dead-O
BTS The next moment he was on his feet again and out in the street prying up a cobblestone
BTS Spencer I remembered enough to know that altruism was imperative to his ideal of highest conduct
BTS Not for nothing had he first seen the light of day in a lonely lair and fought his first fights with the ptarmigan the weasel and the lynx
BTS A second and smaller sled was driven by Mit-sah and to this was harnessed a team of puppies
BTS It has not been kind of you
BTS It is all a dream now as I look back on it
BTS The weasel never relaxed her hold
BTS Never mind your bedding
BTS It is not strange an Indian was saying
BTS The parts of him were better adjusted than those of the average dog
BTS The meat was good meat and White Fang was hungry
BTS Comrade after comrade men and women failed in their attempts and were cruelly executed by the Oligarchy
BTS Each time that his teeth struck they sank easily into the yielding flesh while the animal did not seem able to defend itself
BTS For weeks at a time they would hold on steadily day after day
BTS You do not know us I answered
BTS It did not seem possible that such frail craft could survive such stress of wind and water
BTS Oh no there won't be any escaping if they have anything to say about it
BTS It was he who was responsible for the introduction of the Russian passport system among the miners and the denial of their right of removal from one part of the country to another
BTS Here it is Joy upon joy and gain upon gain Are the destined rights of my birth And I shout the praise of my endless days To the echoing edge of the earth
BTS There was nothing lively about it no snap or go in him and his fellows
BTS The Outside dogs whose digestions had not been trained by chronic famine to make the most of little had voracious appetites
BTS 'Oo's goin' to do it
BTS He came cringing and crawling into the firelight
BTS and in consequence a hundred thousand regular soldiers of the United States has been called out to put a frightful end to the whole affair
BTS It was now dynamic--a fascinating spectacle of dread
BTS though as Buck was afterward to learn each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition
BTS It soared upward with a swift rush till it reached its topmost note where it persisted palpitant and tense and then slowly died away
BTS to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not
BTS But he did not have it in him to be angry with the love-master and when that god elected to laugh at him in a good-natured bantering way he was nonplussed
BTS And there was need for it
BTS That night we stood alternate watches one of us sleeping at a time
BTS Think of it
BTS She was standing a dozen feet away one hand resting on the main-shrouds and her body swaying gently to the slight roll of the ship
BTS But will you look at that
BTS Then what should I do
BTS This one indicating me with his thumb fancies sea-serpents and monkeys just now
BTS The Ghost for the moment was buried beneath the sea
BTS And to one and all he said Why have you not answered the charge that your class has mismanaged
BTS It was now half-past five and half-an-hour later when the last of the day lost itself in a dim and furious twilight I sighted a third boat
BTS He regarded her smilingly
BTS I must say however that the sailors themselves were sympathetic as instance the case of Johnson
BTS The chief obstacle to your Grange propaganda is the trusts
BTS This howling now bothered him
BTS You can't fool my ears
BTS She it was who waited upon the dog
BTS What can I do without her help
BTS The government issued a proclamation for all law-abiding citizens to come in from the mountains for a period of three months
BTS You read the consciousness of life that it is alive
BTS It was a trap
BTS As for me as I said before I know that you not only cannot answer but that you will not attempt an answer
BTS Then approaching at right angles to the trail and cutting off his retreat they saw a dozen wolves lean and grey bounding across the snow
BTS Instinctively we drew closer together in the bottom of the boat
BTS It was no more than a stiff blow but to us fighting for life in our frail craft it was indeed a storm
BTS It was a calm night
BTS They move no more
BTS Yes the geese
BTS Du Bois the present librarian of Ardis is a lineal descendant of this revolutionary pair
BTS To the day of his death he kept up his studies and he studied prodigiously
BTS We must make him a prisoner
BTS For behind any wish of theirs was power to enforce that wish power that hurt power that expressed itself in clouts and clubs in flying stones and stinging lashes of whips
BTS I don't know how to turn the trick
BTS Then he crawled into the heart of a dense thicket and waited
BTS What tools and materials do you require
BTS Our Inner Circle forbade her but she had ever a will of her own and disdained discipline
BTS I know sir was the answer
BTS Removing the pillow and repeating the question he answered promptly that he did
BTS I'll tell you what you do Miss Cunningham
BTS This was my chance
BTS Therein lies the difference
BTS perfectly well
BTS And strange Buck was to him for of the many Southland dogs he had known not one had shown up worthily in camp and on trail
BTS I nodded my head
BTS Still the punishment delayed
BTS In the silence that followed the low half-sobbing whine was heard at the door and then the long questing sniff
BTS Returning to the cave she entered its narrow mouth
BTS and his head somewhat broader was the wolf head on a massive scale
BTS Choice of work was denied them
BTS It would remain constant
BTS I stood regarding him wonderingly
BTS But then I suppose this was a common experience of all of us who had rallied under the red banner of the brotherhood of man
BTS And then in an exuberance of joy I hardly know whether to be glad or not
BTS By this time the column on the street was almost on us
BTS A man's voice screamed once in horror and anguish
BTS Get up there Buck
BTS He's all cut an' gouged underneath
BTS but the next moment I was in Ernest's arms
BTS Perhaps it is his headache I said
BTS I boiled the water but it was Maud who made the coffee
BTS In this he was in advance of his party
BTS were the cries that arose
BTS I am a Dane
BTS He greeted me with one of his whimsical smiles
BTS I had devised an automatic jib-sheet which passed the jib across of itself so there was no need for Maud to attend to that
BTS You must be well up in mathematics I said
BTS But he had long since learned that there was such a thing as Chance or Opportunity and he continued to draw near
BTS Well the Iron Heel has defeated the labor unions on the industrial field and driven them over to the political field
BTS On looking back I realize that the remark was too obvious to make rejoinder necessary
BTS She was gazing not at Thomas Mugridge but at Wolf Larsen
BTS The three disloyal regiments had been destroyed in the fortresses to the last man
BTS It was night-time
BTS You get a nap and I'll reconnoitre
BTS He placed his paw on one and its movements were accelerated
BTS They ain't had a bite in weeks I reckon outside of Fatty an' Frog an' Spanker
BTS Ernest and his fellows knew that their effort was futile but they were tired of the suspense
BTS Here at the rear against the doors we were pressed by a panting gasping mass of creatures
BTS The young man was genuinely astonished
BTS All was quiet as we entered Chicago
BTS How is this wealth owned by these three classes
BTS How was he to know that this thing that sniffed was a thing at which to bristle
BTS He never played and gambolled about with the other puppies of the camp
BTS Slowly slowly the bristling ball straightened out and lengthened
BTS Tied securely White Fang could only rage futilely and endure the punishment
BTS He turned and fled away not from the hurt of the fire but from the laughter that sank even deeper and hurt in the spirit of him
BTS yet White Fang divined that it was his master's food he ate and that it was his master who thus fed him vicariously
BTS He rose to his feet and laughed awkwardly
BTS The regular troops fought the farmers as savagely as had they been Indians
BTS It's unhealthy you know
BTS For never was there such a lover as Ernest Everhard
BTS It covered his eyes
BTS Then sober thought came to me
BTS Their heads were bloody their organization had apparently been destroyed yet out they came along with their allies in the metal-working trades
BTS At dinner he asked the hunters for a remedy for headache and by evening strong man that he was he was half-blind and reeling about the cabin
BTS He did not want to bite the hand and he endured the peril of it until his instinct surged up in him mastering him with its insatiable yearning for life
BTS Like Dave he asked nothing gave nothing expected nothing
BTS There were cries of Sedition
BTS There was their mastery over all these sharp-fanged dogs
BTS You have used the wrong initial consonant he smiled in answer
BTS Tell me Ernest said if this is not true
BTS And I could see Charley Furuseth as I had said good-bye to him that morning lounging in a dressing-gown on the be-pillowed window couch and delivering himself of oracular and pessimistic epigrams
BTS By his comrades he was called The Flame
BTS His arms were around me before I knew
BTS They quarrelled and bickered more than ever among themselves till at times the camp was a howling bedlam
BTS He changed the course and I signalled affirmation when the speck showed dead ahead
BTS The liability is that his part helplessness will make him more malignant than ever
BTS CHAPTER XXXIX The day came for our departure
BTS This reference is to the socialist vote cast in the United States in 1910
BTS You are a blessed bankrupt pair of fools
BTS Well Cooky
BTS The bottom had dropped out of the trail
BTS Hist will ye
BTS According to your ideas he too must be an immortal millionaire
BTS Cabin-boy at twelve ship's boy at fourteen ordinary seamen at sixteen able seaman at seventeen and cock of the fo'c'sle infinite ambition and infinite loneliness receiving neither help nor sympathy I did it all for myself navigation mathematics science literature and what not
BTS it was the Plutocracy that whipped the churches and especially the Catholic Church into line and robbed us of a portion of the labor vote
BTS That's a ferry-boat of some sort the new-comer said indicating a whistle off to the right
BTS Again Wolf Larsen laughed at the same time beckoning them with his arm to follow
BTS In the same way he came to tolerate Matt as a possession of his master
BTS The knowledge that I loved her rushed upon me with the terror and with both emotions gripping at my heart and causing my blood at the same time to chill and to leap riotously I felt myself drawn by a power without me and beyond me and found my eyes returning against my will to gaze into the eyes of Wolf Larsen
BTS Under the approaching smoke the hull and upper-works of a steamer were growing larger
BTS Met him at the Bibelot once and he was telling us how he attempted to make a fire with a couple of sticks
BTS I consider it wrong and criminal to appeal to all that is narrow and brutal in the working class
BTS he called hoarsely and with a note of fright in his voice
BTS To live
BTS My voice sounds faint and far
BTS Oh it was done very nicely I'll allow
BTS while Arthur Simpson referred to in the Manuscript as being ill of typhoid fever at the time of the explosion received only fifteen years
BTS He continued to publish the advertisements for which he no longer received pay
BTS He felt a vacancy in him a need for the hush and quietude of the stream and the cave in the cliff
BTS There were no inequalities of surface
BTS Buck was no less eager and no less cautious as he likewise circled back and forth for the advantage
BTS He did not hesitate a moment
BTS If they left him alone he left them alone a state of affairs that they found after a few encounters to be pre-eminently desirable
BTS Perhaps the wind would haul a few points while we were at dinner and as I left the table he would say Mr
BTS What was it all about
BTS It was in the debate on the bill to assist the unemployed
BTS Surely not
BTS I nodded at recollection of the vulpine-face superintendent of the Sierra Mills
BTS If otherwise then the only conclusion I could reach was that the sensitive skin recognized the difference of temperature between shade and sunshine
BTS He betrayed the inaccuracies of the self-read man and it must be granted the sureness and directness of the primitive mind
BTS It devised a plan of reaching its subscribers through the express companies but they declined to handle it
BTS He was the only one that was cool and Ernest treated him with a respect he had not accorded the others
BTS Cabin-boy
BTS A constitution of iron and the vitality of the Wild were White Fang's inheritance and he clung to life the whole of him and every part of him in spirit and in flesh with the tenacity that of old belonged to all creatures
BTS 'Tis nothin' I've said
BTS The captain shrugged his shoulders
BTS It was the wolf in him that I saw and a mad wolf at that
BTS You call me a pessimist
BTS And my like for him was founded on things beyond intellect and argument
BTS And you shall sleep until luncheon
BTS One Eye watched
BTS and amidst the general crumble of prices the price of labor crumbled fastest of all
BTS Then three or four western bad men aspired to clean out the town were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains and public interest turned to other idols
BTS He still pressed his left hand against his forehead
BTS At that time polygamy was still practised in Turkey
BTS You've earned it was the young officer's answer
BTS I'll give you a thousand for him sir a thousand sir twelve hundred sir
BTS Besides she added haltingly it's your idea and I want to see you succeed
BTS He had begun to romp with them in a feeble awkward way and even to squabble his little throat vibrating with a queer rasping noise the forerunner of the growl as he worked himself into a passion
BTS The hard times
BTS How could I put into speech a something felt a something like the strains of music heard in sleep a something that convinced yet transcended utterance
BTS But man
BTS As they slid along noiseless as shadows in the moonlight they came upon a run-way
BTS Jean Jacques Rousseau enunciated your socialistic theory nearly two centuries ago
BTS It's the only thing to do
BTS It was passed unanimously by the Senate on January 14 1903
BTS But Ernest steadied himself for a moment and waved his arms for silence
BTS Her mouth opened the saliva drooled forth and she licked her chops with the pleasure of anticipation
BTS The lazy brutes I'll show them he cried preparing to lash out at them with the whip
BTS And tell Johnson to douse him with a few buckets of salt water he added in a lower tone for my ear alone
BTS Perhaps they sensed his wild-wood breed and instinctively felt for him the enmity that the domestic dog feels for the wolf
BTS And he fled to Kiche raging at the end of her stick like an animal gone mad to Kiche the one creature in the world who was not laughing at him
BTS But Grey Beaver laughed loudly and slapped his thighs and told the happening to all the rest of the camp till everybody was laughing uproariously
BTS and then I discovered to my amazement that there was no need for Maud to slack away
BTS And furthermore the war would consume many national surpluses reduce the armies of unemployed that menaced all countries and give the Oligarchy a breathing space in which to perfect its plans and carry them out
BTS He's one of us and he's in the Mercenaries and I'm afraid for him
BTS I'm hitting the long trail old man where you cannot follow
BTS It expresses the garrulity of the sea and is a pleasant break in the monotony of the life
BTS As for ourselves not one of us knew how the bomb was thrown
BTS Congressman Wiley in the brief discussion that was permitted said that the bill 'provided for a reserve force to take the mob by the throat'--you're the mob gentlemen--'and protect at all hazards life liberty and property
BTS We followed in his wake a space then dropped down a zigzag trail that he disdained into a group of noble redwoods that stood about a pool of water murky with minerals from the mountain side
BTS And where was he
BTS And I observed also that his whole body had unconsciously drawn itself together tense and alert
BTS Days and nights of sleeplessness and anxiety had doubtless turned my head
BTS she asked
BTS He was surprised
BTS Francois guiding the sled at the gee-pole sometimes exchanged places with him but not often
BTS From Spitzbergen through the Arctic and across Canada and the Barrens he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them
BTS I had had no sleep for forty-eight hours
BTS My contribution was canned beef fried with crumbled sea-biscuit and water
BTS He's roostin' in a tree at the last camp
BTS Up the street and down I looked
BTS Where's Lord Alfred
BTS My father
BTS The time went by
BTS and he knew more of its secrets and stratagems
BTS What phrase
BTS I involuntarily shunned the thought of it and yet the thought continually arose in my mind like a haunting spectre
BTS Father came of stout old Mayflower stock and the blood was imperative in him
BTS The kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated hand
BTS He sniffled and wept but Wolf Larsen was pitiless
BTS If you are sure of the rent it is all right
BTS You are perishing and you are doomed to perish utterly from the face of society
BTS There has been nothing like it in the history of the world
BTS Possibly his success in capturing so many hunters and boats had counteracted the customary reaction
BTS But there was Jackson and Jackson's arm and the blood that stained my gown and dripped from my own roof-beams
BTS If you come I'll shake them for you
BTS he escorted Mollie and Alice the Judge's daughters on long twilight or early morning rambles
BTS It seemed likely to bear fruit
BTS The next moment the two mothers separated and before they rushed together again the lynx lashed out at the cub with a huge fore-paw that ripped his shoulder open to the bone and sent him hurtling sidewise against the wall
BTS His brutal materialism will not permit it
BTS He sadly overrates himself
BTS One at a time
BTS But after a time he grew even to like the children
BTS was the captain's next demand this time of the hunters lounging about the companion-way
BTS And what have you to say
BTS So that at the end of five days we found ourselves short but four men Henderson Holyoak Williams and Kelly and were once more hunting on the flanks of the herd
BTS Students interested in such matters should read the brochure of Arnold Bentham soon to be published
BTS I thought he must be somebody was the faro-dealer's comment
BTS One hand he held tightly against his side and behind him he left a bloody trail
BTS As we ran off to get our leeward position of the last lee boat we found the ocean fairly carpeted with sleeping seals
BTS It seemed like a conjuration
BTS But as they grew shorter and White Fang's second winter in the Southland came on he made a strange discovery
BTS I did not know what palaces were made for but now I have found a use for them
BTS It was through no special eagerness for more gains that the Rockefellers began to branch out from oil into other things
BTS Buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity
BTS I put the shovel away and calmly sat down on the coal-box facing him
BTS But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog
BTS But I have yet to stamp upon others with them
BTS --nothing save one final awful glut of vengeance
BTS You'll find nothing gruesome down there he said only an unhurt man securely made fast to the ring-bolts
BTS As you love me Buck
BTS They were in a wretched state worn out and worn down
BTS The puppy's name as White Fang was afterward to hear him called was Lip-lip
BTS but again as with the body the massiveness seemed to vanish and a conviction to grow of a tremendous and excessive mental or spiritual strength that lay behind sleeping in the deeps of his being
BTS but she was still hoisting the jib when I put the wheel hard down
BTS Twenty-eight hundred of them had been annihilated in a tremendous series of dynamite explosions in Oregon and in a similar manner a number of train loads at different times and places had been destroyed
BTS They led him from the platform to prevent him from uttering more heresy
BTS and while he disliked it in the learning of it unknown to himself he was learning to like it
BTS They were all about him and the fire in a narrow circle and he could see them plainly in the firelight lying down sitting up crawling forward on their bellies or slinking back and forth
BTS We young fellows have our work yet to do
BTS Middle class 8429845
BTS Louis surveyed me with his shrewd grey eyes and shook his head portentously
BTS He described his ambitions and ideals and his conception of the paradise wherein lived the people of the upper classes
BTS At first amid the applause of the gods he betrayed a trifle of his old self-consciousness and awkwardness
BTS he demanded
BTS When he dragged the result of his day's hunt into the cave the she-wolf inspected it turned her muzzle to him and lightly licked him on the neck
BTS If you but knew how many of its leaders have been bought out in similar ways in the past
BTS I know that I was lost in a great wonder almost a stupor this then was a woman
BTS We fled hand in hand down the bloody pavement slipping and sliding and making for the corner
BTS Oh nothing he added softly as if he were drowsing
BTS By it he trimmed his conduct and adjusted his actions
BTS Thus he was strong from the two days' eating a lynx had afforded him when the hungry wolf-pack ran full tilt upon him
BTS Dashing at top speed around a tepee he ran full tilt into Kiche lying at the end of her stick
BTS Sometimes the laborers refused to work
BTS We of the Revolution caught vague rumors of the state of affairs but had nothing definite enough for an understanding
BTS His arms were resting on the half-open slide
BTS They were always crawling and sprawling toward it and being driven back from it by their mother
BTS I had never heard anything like it in my life nor could I have conceived it possible
BTS Its planking was three-quarters of an inch thick
BTS The human had to pass through those stages in its rise from the mire and slime of low organic life
BTS Go up on deck
BTS He may lie there all night
BTS But Kelly didn't amount to much was the reply
BTS It's good coffee too I know
BTS Possibly I recited with a certain joyous lilt which was my own for his memory was good and at a second rendering very often the first he made a quatrain his own he recited the same lines and invested them with an unrest and passionate revolt that was well-nigh convincing
BTS 'E's got no right to live an' as the Good Word puts it 'E shall shorely die' an' I s'y Amen an' damn soon at that
BTS She rolled him off his legs so that he could not run while she repeatedly ripped and slashed him with her fangs
BTS But she heard also that other and louder call the call of the fire and of man the call which has been given alone of all animals to the wolf to answer to the wolf and the wild-dog who are brothers
BTS I hoped desperately that he might commit some hostile act attempt to strike me or choke me
BTS In doing this they had protected both themselves and the gods whose companionship they shared
BTS Besides not only had he abandoned the Wild and his kind when he gave himself up to man but the terms of the covenant were such that if ever he met Kiche again he would not desert his god to go with her
BTS Metaphysics had nothing to do with it Ernest retorted
BTS Still nothing happened
BTS The master went out on horseback a great deal and to accompany him was one of White Fang's chief duties in life
BTS But that was long ago she continued
BTS The British Empire was falling apart
BTS Drop it
BTS He's just come through hell an' this is the first time he's ben loose
BTS He had evidently gone below
BTS His right cheek was red with blood which flowed from some wound in the head
BTS The man sat down on his blankets in a crouching position
BTS A-beefin' and bellerin' 'round as though he'd kill you when he gets you
BTS Maud laughed at my crestfallen expression and I said As soon as the wind abates I intend going in the boat to explore the island
BTS For all his pragmatic certitude it seemed as if he watched the play and movement of life in the hope of discovering something more about it of discerning in its maddest writhings a something which had hitherto escaped him the key to its mystery as it were which would make all clear and plain
BTS For that matter there were very few people on the train--only a baker's dozen in our car
BTS Very true Ernest answered
BTS By you I answered steadily
BTS I refer to Mr
BTS The chickens he calmly ignored
BTS In 1905 A
BTS But the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save chivalrous
BTS The pang as I plunged into it was as quick and sharp as that of fire
BTS It was more of a toy affair than anything else yet it was the delight of Mit-sah who felt that he was beginning to do a man's work in the world
BTS There were inequalities of surface
BTS They were better housed better clothed better fed better treated
BTS Young man they have always worked
BTS May God damn your soul to hell Wolf Larsen only hell's too good for you you coward you murderer you pig
BTS He crouched and bristled a little at the thought of it
BTS I'd let me soul an' body burn in everlastin' hell for them children of mine was his answer
BTS The wild wave of famished beasts rolled back before them and Buck shook himself free
BTS He fed the dogs cooked and ate his supper and made his bed close to the fire
BTS He too had taken the part of the lowly and oppressed and against all the established power of priest and pharisee
BTS But I can't give him the lesson until I catch him in the act
BTS I was thunderstruck
BTS then added with a sigh of relief and unaware that she had glanced that relief at Wolf Larsen I am so glad
BTS Four billion dollars of wealth is produced in one year in the United States
BTS How is the Ghost lying
BTS We are going to be throttled
BTS They'll be goin' mad yet an' then watch out
BTS I was unable to prevent it is a better way of phrasing it I replied still gently
BTS I was desperate
BTS Because you can't
BTS So my smile is crooked
BTS It was a knowledge bequeathed to him directly from the hunting generation of wolves
BTS He felt the halyards with his hands and discovered that I had not made them fast
BTS With the German Emperor out of the way Germany would have no surplus to sell abroad
BTS As in the past he had bristled and snarled at sight of Lip-lip so now and automatically he bristled and snarled
BTS Again I hurried on
BTS demanded those who had been really asleep and who had wakened to they knew not what
BTS I've got my rights he whimpered
BTS It is a tale of blood
BTS Is it because you have no answer
BTS Thus great statesmen--and there had been such occasions--were able fully to speak their minds
BTS I confess he makes me nervous around the children she said
BTS I am often thankful that I have no children and I dearly love children
BTS No that could not be else he would not have been driven out
BTS my flesh revolted
BTS The next day White Fang's anxiety and restlessness were even more pronounced
BTS There isn't a street car running
BTS There was a fumbling and a scratching of matches and the sea-lamp flared up dim and smoky and in its weird light bare-legged men moved about nursing their bruises and caring for their hurts
BTS The phenomena of life Hump he girded at me
BTS I displayed it openly during our conversation but he took no notice of it
BTS The world as he saw it was a fierce and brutal world a world without warmth a world in which caresses and affection and the bright sweetnesses of the spirit did not exist
BTS But Beauty Smith knew the ways of Indians
BTS We could all live comfortably aboard
BTS It was he that first learned the trick of rolling a fellow-cub over with a cunning paw-stroke
BTS Or dying was her afterthought when she had waited some time for me to speak
BTS I cautiously descended the ladder
BTS He appeared waiting for the words with which to express the thought that was in him and finally went on
BTS Hello on deck I replied
BTS The schooner Ghost bound seal-hunting to Japan
BTS They went across divides in summer blizzards shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast
BTS CHAPTER XXXIV It's too bad the Ghost has lost her masts
BTS This was the beast to be stamped upon and the highest duty of the aristocrat was to stamp upon it
BTS No for Brazil now has a surplus too
BTS They moved
BTS The local news was missing
BTS The chin with the damp black beard pointed higher in the air as the back muscles stiffened and the chest swelled in an unconscious and instinctive effort to get more air
BTS It was true that they prattled sweet little ideals and dear little moralities but in spite of their prattle the dominant key of the life they lived was materialistic
BTS An' wasn't it a week later that the poor little ladies was put ashore on the other side of the island with nothin' before 'em but to walk home acrost the mountains on their weeny-teeny little straw sandals which wouldn't hang together a mile
BTS From without as through thick walls came the muffled roar of bursting bombs
BTS I know English and I know what you mean sir Johnson answered his flush deepening at the slur on his knowledge of the English language
BTS You will understand I took advantage of the opportunity to say whatever part I take in what is going on and what is to come that I am compelled to take it if you and I are ever to get out of this scrape with our lives
BTS Let us control them
BTS There is no such thing as a conflict of interest between labor and capital--or rather there ought not to be
BTS Often and often has the Iron Heel been dumbfounded by the miscarriage of its plans and operations against us
BTS As the Ghost rolled her side out of water the boat was lifted snugly against her and before the return roll came we had heaved it in over the side and turned it bottom up on the deck
BTS You have gone up in the air and are arranging a division between the kind of men that ought to be but are not
BTS Simple as A B C
BTS As in his cubhood he had been made to feel his smallness and puniness on the day he first came in from the Wild to the village of Grey Beaver so now in his full-grown stature and pride of strength he was made to feel small and puny
BTS Ah my boy he shook his head ominously at me 'tis the worst schooner ye could iv selected nor were ye drunk at the time as was I
BTS Wearied from the night of struggle and wreck all hands were yet asleep I thought
BTS By them a large portion of the perplexing surplus was consumed
BTS but it was elective for the threatened blow did not descend
BTS Where's the wolf
BTS Was mine' you should have said not 'is mine
BTS There are more sailors than there are ships on the sea for them more workers than there are factories or machines for them
BTS It seems to me that all things of the mind are metaphysical
BTS Their only effect upon him however was to make him uneasy and restless without his knowing what was the matter
BTS and when the last fight was over and White Fang and the pack had scattered he would return slowly to the fort his face heavy with regret
BTS Nor was his uninjured hand behind his back hiding something
BTS The issue is the Workers versus the Plutocracy
BTS As it was he cowered down in a paralysis of fear already half proffering the submission that his kind had proffered from the first time a wolf came in to sit by man's fire and be made warm
BTS He had survived too many battles to be in doubt for a moment about what to do
BTS The stables were reached and there in the doorway lay Collie a half-dozen pudgy puppies playing about her in the sun
BTS A curling wave struck the side and splashed salt spray on my lips
BTS And what is the meaning of that in turn
BTS Assured of their faithfulness the Iron Heel can snap its fingers at all the rest of labor
BTS And still the bull-dog with grim certitude toiled after him
BTS Garthwaite seized my arm and we were just starting to run when he dragged me back from in front of the wheels of half a dozen war automobiles equipped with machine-guns that were rushing for the spot
BTS He did not rest
BTS Also dogs being so constituted in their mental ways the sight of him running away gave desire to run after him and a feeling that he ran away from them
BTS Johansen
BTS Unsafe as was his present position he was loath to forsake it for the more unsafe position on the halyards
BTS But as a rule he managed to maintain a dignity that was almost solemnity
BTS In the natural course of things there were exceptions to this
BTS I cried gaily
BTS and now you are in Grange politics
BTS He was a monstrous tyrant
BTS He alone among men could put a pack upon Buck's back in the summer travelling
BTS A thousand times this occurred and each time the terror it inspired was as vivid and great as ever
BTS As Buck watched them Thornton knelt beside him and with rough kindly hands searched for broken bones
BTS You are in the midst of a transition stage now in economic evolution but you do not understand it and that's what causes all the confusion
BTS They don't want the machines destroyed
BTS and monstrous cable and electric cars hooting and clanging through the midst screeching their insistent menace after the manner of the lynxes he had known in the northern woods
BTS Of course in common speech with the sailors and hunters it sometimes fairly bristled with errors which was due to the vernacular itself
BTS Slowly the mast swung in until it balanced at right angles across the rail
BTS He said the university needed ever so much more money this year than the state was willing to furnish
BTS Somewhere out there in the snow screened from his sight by trees and thickets Henry knew that the wolf-pack One Ear and Bill were coming together
BTS Louis gave a spoke and temporized
BTS True there were lines but they were the lines of decision and firmness
BTS I too was busy trying to reason out how he was aware of the existence of so intangible a thing as a shadow
BTS Mail steamer he answered shortly
BTS my woman my mate went ringing through my brain but now alas it was a knell that sounded
BTS But Louis took and gave a spoke and gazed imperturbably into the binnacle
BTS but before I dropped into the lazarette I took the precaution of casting down the door in advance
BTS The breakfast was a success and we sat about the fire much longer than enterprising explorers should have done sipping the hot black coffee and talking over our situation
BTS And Aristotle was a metaphysician
BTS The hair of this man was long and matted and his head slanted back under it from the eyes
BTS I could see the effect Ernest was beginning to have on him
BTS CHAPTER XVI I cannot say that the position of mate carried with it anything more joyful than that there were no more dishes to wash
BTS I knew this was true of myself but hers was such a lily strength that I feared she would break down
BTS Later in the day he chanced upon another stray chicken near the stables
BTS He was surprised at the commonness of the clay
BTS A wolf-mother was not made to remember her cubs of a year or so before
BTS They got away I said cheerfully
BTS The vessel seemed to go off at a tangent to its former course and leapt almost instantly from view into the fog
BTS She had been out-manoeuvred and out-run to say nothing of her having been unceremoniously tumbled in the gravel and her arrival was like that of a tornado made up of offended dignity justifiable wrath and instinctive hatred for this marauder from the Wild
BTS All hands were on deck for they knew that something was to happen when Leach and Johnson were dragged aboard
BTS Rockefeller's 2500000 a month had increased to four to five to six millions a month to 75000000 a year
BTS but under the dominion of man it is sometimes even shorter
BTS But this was quickly followed by anger
BTS And there's no reason why we cannot still manage without it
BTS Weedon Scott strode half across the room toward him at the same time calling him
BTS There was a leap swifter than his unpractised sight and the lean yellow body disappeared for a moment out of the field of his vision
BTS But he was not destined to enjoy that bed
BTS Of course there wasn't any mortgage and never had been any mortgage
BTS I shrank from his hand
BTS Oh she's a-comin'
BTS The one might wag but the others held their terrible grip on White Fang's throat
BTS 'Ow I 'ate 'im
BTS I could see their faces flushed and angry the brutality distorted and emphasized by the sickly yellow of the sea-lamps which rocked back and forth with the ship
BTS Of course there was nothing definite
BTS But it was the heartlessness of it that especially struck me
BTS He continued his plodding pursuit though once for the moment baffled he came to a full stop and blinked at the men who looked on at the same time wagging his stump of a tail as an expression of his willingness to fight
BTS The dust-demon was the lord of the household
BTS The members of the favored unions were branded as traitors and in saloons and brothels on the streets and at work and in fact everywhere they were assaulted by the comrades they had so treacherously deserted
BTS The first rays of the sun streamed upon our backs as we climbed
BTS The small capitalists who were in these thousands of enterprises are gone
BTS It was the creation of Miss Brentwood an enormously wealthy old maid
BTS Johnson hesitated but the long years of obedience to the masters of ships overpowered him and he dropped sullenly to the deck and went on forward
BTS Little did I dream the terrible road the Bishop was destined to travel--the Gethsemane and crucifixion that Ernest had pondered about
BTS I'll do for you yet you slab-footed Swede I heard him say to Johansen one night on deck
BTS Every little while some one or another of you is so discharged
BTS He gave them facts always facts checked their excursions into the air and brought them back to the solid earth and its facts
BTS Beauty Smith decided that the snow was the safest place for him and lay where he had fallen making no effort to get up
BTS One Ear didn't get no fish
BTS CHAPTER XI The Ghost has attained the southernmost point of the arc she is describing across the Pacific and is already beginning to edge away to the west and north toward some lone island it is rumoured where she will fill her water-casks before proceeding to the season's hunt along the coast of Japan
BTS Not that I was afraid of it however or reluctant to meet it
BTS I could see that she was still badly frightened
BTS Him I knew well and had known well for many years
BTS His eyes were wet
BTS Such was our plan every detail of which had to be worked out in secret and as the day drew near communicated to more and more comrades
BTS That also is a fact
BTS Just wait and see was the answer
BTS Must be a tame wolf I reckon
BTS Upon which impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex-prerogative she made their lives unendurable
BTS Wolf Larsen was undisguised in his admiration
BTS In the Wild he had hunted live meat that was infinitely timid and he knew the advantage of surprise
BTS Must a' thought he had hold of seventeen devils the dog-musher sniggered
BTS I guess we know our business best was the retort
BTS There was no end to the strange things these gods did and he was always curious to see
BTS He did not love Grey Beaver yet even in the face of his will and his anger he was faithful to him
BTS Hartman gripped my arm and dragged me into a wide entrance
BTS Not a copy was obtainable from any bookseller
BTS Some were short-legged too short
BTS It was an expression of perfect confidence of absolute self-surrender as though he said I put myself into thy hands
BTS Wasn't it er Crusoe who rubbed sticks together
BTS The pure air was like nectar
BTS But we could not tell which was which--which building contained our comrades and which the Mercenaries
BTS But he had yet to learn the remarkable quickness of White Fang who struck with the certainty and swiftness of a coiled snake
BTS He killed other dogs as easily as men killed mosquitoes
BTS And yet it could not be
BTS yea also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil and madness is in their heart while they live and after that they go to the dead
BTS When she forced him too hard he was compelled to go about in a circle his shoulder presented to her his head turned from her and on his face and in his eyes a patient and bored expression
BTS There are butterflies in the sunshine and from everywhere arises the drowsy hum of bees
BTS That they can shoot us by drumhead court martial if we refuse
BTS And behind this cry was Japan ever urging and aiding the yellow and brown races against the white
BTS He never looked at me that way all the time you was gone
BTS I wanted to become a naturalist he explained shyly as though confessing a weakness
BTS The second balloon was a failure
BTS The cub experienced another access of affection on the part of his mother
BTS She too soared high but not so high as the quarry and her teeth clipped emptily together with a metallic snap
BTS During the early summer in the last days of the famine he met Lip-lip who had likewise taken to the woods where he had eked out a miserable existence
BTS That vessel will soon be passing us I said after a moment's pause
BTS Fully five feet in length and standing two and one-half feet at the shoulder he far outweighed a wolf of corresponding size
BTS Thornton's bluff if bluff it was had been called
BTS The island was highest at its extreme south-western point the headlands and backbone diminishing regularly until the north-eastern portion was only a few feet above the sea
BTS We all understand them
BTS You nag worse than a woman
BTS It was after the dinner that father told me what little he knew about him
BTS On the other hand we could not dream of allowing the young oligarch to depart
BTS He sauntered slowly forward to the break of the poop and leaning his elbow on the corner of the cabin gazed down thoughtfully and curiously at the excited boy
BTS I should prefer going with you she said in a low voice in which there was just a hint of appeal
BTS You make small-capitalist political speeches such as Mr
BTS The day was a repetition of the days that had gone before
BTS Its coat was the true wolf-coat
BTS All other animals lived in the Wild and were when not too formidable lawful spoil for any dog
BTS Glimmerings of weakness in the armor of the Oligarchy were given
BTS it was a mere expletive but it came from his soul
BTS And yet Grey Beaver was as a child-god among these white-skinned ones
BTS Capital's share is called 'dividends
BTS Our own refuges were packed with comrades who had prices on their heads
BTS She screamed with fright as he seized her dress in his teeth and dragged on it till the frail fabric tore away

BTS PART II CHAPTER I THE BATTLE OF THE FANGS It was the she-wolf who had first caught the sound of men's voices and the whining of the sled-dogs
BTS This feeling had been accentuated by the Ishmaelite life he had led from his puppyhood
BTS Whereupon he sat up and ki-yi'd louder than ever
BTS She was clearly on the verge of physical collapse
BTS Later a small tent was put up
BTS If they were of course all would be well
BTS Then he rolled over on his side his head resting on the biceps of the under arm the forearm shielding his eyes from the sun
BTS His lips were flecked with a soapy froth and sometimes he choked and gurgled and became inarticulate
BTS For going down into the cabin to turn in I decided that it was too stuffy to sleep below
BTS Francois called Buck to him threw his arms around him wept over him
BTS And then while I worked at building the hut Maud tried out the oil from the blubber and kept a slow fire under the frames of meat
BTS They were tended by armies of servants and their social activities were bewildering
BTS He saw the blaze of the fire Kloo-kooch cooking and Grey Beaver squatting on his hams and mumbling a chunk of raw tallow
BTS I was overborne by the crowd
BTS the life that was in you that composes you that is greater than you did not want to die
BTS Lively now
BTS They wanted to live they were helpless like rats in a trap and they screamed
BTS Buck led the pack sixty strong around bend after bend but he could not gain
BTS No matter how terribly he was beaten he had always another growl
BTS Not you
BTS Nearer and nearer it came
BTS That is a question you must settle with Mr
BTS My knee is much better though it often aches for long periods and the stiffness is gradually leaving the arm which Wolf Larsen squeezed
BTS Chapter II
BTS So it was at last impressed upon me that I was there not to have Wolf Larsen take the initiative but to take it myself
BTS the beautiful
BTS And unconsciously this way and that he glanced for avenues of escape
BTS he commanded Oofty-Oofty the Kanaka who had in the meantime relieved Louis at the wheel
BTS She slept continuously a tiny skeleton flung round with skin in which the flame flickered lower and lower and at last went out
BTS Why you are chilled through
BTS Besides all Southland dogs looked upon him with suspicion
BTS But Bishop Morehouse ignored him and went on Their outlook is too narrow
BTS But now Lip-lip was his dog and he proceeded to wreak his vengeance on him by putting him at the end of the longest rope
BTS Oh it paid us
BTS She insisted and said Please please whereupon I turned the oar over to her and obeyed
BTS It was April and White Fang was a year old when he pulled into the home villages and was loosed from the harness by Mit-sah
BTS And you've got to look out too
BTS There was one strange thing about this wall of light
BTS he was reiterating at the top of his lungs
BTS By the time I had seen the lawyer who had handled Jackson's case and the two foremen and the superintendent at the mills who had testified I began to feel that there was something after all in Ernest's contention
BTS ' I looked at him triumphantly
BTS So unnerved was I by the thought of impending violence to Leach and Johnson that my reason must have left me
BTS Complicated as it was it was carried through without a hitch and as a very creditable achievement it cheered us on in our work
BTS ' There's not a man among 'em to-day to take a drink with me if I asked him
BTS And you won't lose I agreed
BTS and he saw Francois swinging an axe spring into the mess of dogs
BTS When he was very near I heard him crying in vexed fashion Why in hell don't you sing out
BTS One Ear strained the full length of the stick toward the intruder and whined with eagerness
BTS It seemed centuries possibly it was no more than ten minutes that the beating continued
BTS and he was bruised and sore in all his small body when he was again flung down in the canoe
BTS At least half of their enthusiasm to-day was due to that
BTS With a turn for literary expression myself and a penchant for forcible figures and phrases I appreciated as no other listener I dare say the peculiar vividness and strength and absolute blasphemy of his metaphors
BTS He passed me the signals of the Iron Heel's secret service in token that he too was in its employ
BTS Why you'd have to hire a man 'specially to take care of 'm
BTS As compared with the Indians he had known they were to him another race of beings a race of superior gods
BTS We're dead safe he assured them with a laugh
BTS I shall always think of it with pride I said to Maud
BTS Your hearts are hard as your heels with which you tread upon the faces of the poor
BTS As a critic I was compelled to place you
BTS They were shrewd-faced interesting men and they talked with simplicity and clearness
BTS I could never fight my way out as Wolf Larsen had done
BTS White Fang was in a rage wickedly making his attack on the most vulnerable spot
BTS He is said to have remarked when he put them in that he preferred turning her over to losing the sticks
BTS and several days more found all stays and shrouds in place and everything set up taut
BTS You are one with a crowd of men who have made what they call a government who are masters of all the other men and who eat the food the other men get and would like to eat themselves
BTS I doubt that he has ever lived so swiftly and keenly before and I honestly envy him sometimes when I see him raging at the summit of passion and sensibility
BTS I had to rest frequently
BTS The Second Revolt was truly international
BTS Then Wolf Larsen shouted from the poop Grab hold something you you Hump
BTS I listened for a while to the behaviour of the Ghost to the pounding of the seas and the muffled roar of the wind on deck and then turned over on my side and slept peacefully until morning
BTS But now his waning powers would not permit such a course
BTS But I am independent
BTS Let each one of you who is prosperous take into his house some thief and treat him as his brother some unfortunate and treat her as his sister and San Francisco will need no police force and no magistrates
BTS Then he discovered his mistake and tried to placate her
BTS and I have seen Leach fling himself upon Wolf Larsen without warning or provocation
BTS It so outraged him and upset him that for hours he would behave like a demon
BTS There was no possible chance of missing him no matter how poor my marksmanship
BTS There was no hope for the mastiff from the first
BTS Thirteen men were killed and many more were wounded
BTS Also at times when his god looked at him and spoke to him he betrayed an awkward self-consciousness caused by the struggle of his love to express itself and his physical inability to express it
BTS I seemed to stand outside myself and to look at myself incredulously
BTS The three local newspapers rejected my communication likewise did the two weeklies
BTS He would have made a good scientist if his energies had been directed that way
BTS Then I discovered I had forgotten guy-ropes
BTS You don't say that you like to squeeze profits out of others and that you are making all the row because others are squeezing your profits out of you
BTS And never did it flag in its pursuit of him
BTS Holding the paper in my left hand I smashed down upon the cap with a rock held in my right
BTS It was not until Weedon Scott put the harness on White Fang and worked him that he understood
BTS Put down that gun
BTS It possessed many possibilities was capable of being moulded into many different forms
BTS The shears she said and her voice trembled
BTS This was a source of enjoyment to him
BTS Here then were these enormous sums in cash pouring in--more than 2000000 a month for John Davison Rockefeller alone
BTS Lord Avebury an Englishman uttered the following in the House of Lords The unrest in Europe the spread of socialism and the ominous rise of Anarchism are warnings to the governments and the ruling classes that the condition of the working classes in Europe is becoming intolerable and that if a revolution is to be avoided some steps must be taken to increase wages reduce the hours of labor and lower the prices of the necessaries of life
BTS Be quite friendly with him talk with him discuss literature and art with him he is fond of such things
BTS And here and there this selfish policy worked successfully
BTS A heavy swivel-hook baited with fat salt-pork was dropped overside
BTS Highly as the dog-driver had forevalued Buck with his two devils he found while the day was yet young that he had undervalued
BTS CHAPTER IV What happened to me next on the sealing-schooner Ghost as I strove to fit into my new environment are matters of humiliation and pain
BTS He spent half the day extending his campfire to the tree at any moment a half dozen burning faggots ready at hand to fling at his enemies
BTS As Buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow his nose was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped and pulled it
BTS Wherever a man was encountered he was shot down on the spot
BTS What can I tell you
BTS And now for the first time in my life I found myself responsible for some one else
BTS It was this instance that provoked from Eugene V
BTS I did not wish Maud's spirits to be dampened by such a find so I turned seaward again with our boat and skirted the north-eastern point of the island
BTS She shook her head
BTS The Red Virgin is reported to have been one of the most adept in the art to which must be ascribed her long and successful career
BTS The next moment the flash of yellow reappeared before his eyes
BTS At my direction Maud fetched a rope
BTS Came the day when Grey Beaver deciding that the liability of her running away was past released Kiche
BTS The she-wolf too left her litter and went out in search of meat
BTS Undoubtedly he was some emissary of the Iron Heel but he has escaped detection
BTS As darkness came on the hunting-cries to right and left and rear drew closer so close that more than once they sent surges of fear through the toiling dogs throwing them into short-lived panics
BTS His most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a night in advance
BTS The single block of my original shears-tackle I had attached to the end of the boom
BTS Get busy you American revolutionists
BTS Though the declaration of my love urged and trembled on my tongue a thousand times I knew that it was no time for such a declaration
BTS To escape death he would have done anything and the police agents prepared him by assuring him that he could not possibly escape conviction of murder in the first degree when his trial came off
BTS I recoiled before contemplation of that frightful death and for a moment I entertained the wild idea of seizing Maud in my arms and leaping overboard
BTS There was a great snarling and growling a clashing of teeth and a flurry of bodies
BTS From the way he cut up the other time you went away I wouldn't wonder this time but what he died
BTS Many of the comrades were disheartened and they retaliated with terroristic tactics
BTS He even went out of his way to bully Buck striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the death of one or the other
BTS They were being tried for high treason and their places were taken by the creatures of the Iron Heel
BTS he demanded
BTS The newspapers showered him with praise and honor and commended him for having given up the drudgery of the lecture room in order to devote his whole time to scientific research
BTS It caused him to feel a vague sweet gladness and he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what
BTS He ran into sticks and things
BTS What you need is quinine an' I'm goin' to dose you up stiff as soon as we make McGurry
BTS That night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping
BTS They might laugh among themselves about anything they pleased except himself and he did not mind
BTS It had no hair protection
BTS But for the stray brown on his muzzle and above his eyes and for the splash of white hair that ran midmost down his chest he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf larger than the largest of the breed
BTS Hunger he had known
BTS Buck heard them go and raised his head to see Pike was leading Sol-leks was at the wheel and between were Joe and Teek
BTS She nodded her head
BTS Then he crawled back into the blankets
BTS Clear enough I answered glancing at the sunshine which streamed down the open companion-way
BTS Labor cannot consume any of it for labor has already spent all its wages
BTS but the blood surged darkly across Smoke's forehead and he half opened his mouth to speak
BTS the establishment of our secret printing-presses
BTS I say why not
BTS What will happen when every country in the world down to the smallest and last with a surplus in its hands stands confronting every other country with surpluses in their hands
BTS So fast had she been running that she rolled along now on her back now on her side as she struggled to stop clawing gravel with her feet and crying shrilly her hurt pride and indignation
BTS So this will be the last night we have to stand watch and because of that it will go the easier
BTS It does not matter whether it is in one year ten or a thousand--your class shall be dragged down
BTS she retorted
BTS It began with like and out of it slowly developed
BTS After some time of this the wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was going somewhere
BTS There was--but I'll not call any names
BTS No
BTS To-day she was examined by the regular insanity experts
BTS I see the fear of death in your eyes
BTS I could not squirm or struggle like a schoolboy
BTS Mush
BTS Half-stunned by the blow Buck was knocked backward and the lash laid upon him again and again while Spitz soundly punished the many times offending Pike
BTS Also I carried the dirk in a sheath at my hip sailor-fashion and maintained toward Thomas Mugridge a constant attitude which was composed of equal parts of domineering insult and contempt
BTS And still she pleaded with me not to cast off the masts
BTS This was no time for explanations
BTS Strain
BTS Calvin made
BTS I took his pulse
BTS but here you will find them misconceptions
BTS What's the matter
BTS To-day the Plutocracy makes the law and to enforce the law it has at its beck and call the police the army the navy and lastly the militia which is you and me and all of us
BTS Meynell was living the life of a savage and living it quite successfully I said easily
BTS It was during Jim Hall's third term in prison that he encountered a guard that was almost as great a beast as he
BTS There was no telling what unknown terrors were theirs what unknown hurts they could administer
BTS He who delights the most lives the most and your dreams and unrealities are less disturbing to you and more gratifying than are my facts to me
BTS He was in a savage temper and standing over six feet from the ground was as formidable an antagonist as even Buck could desire
BTS Wind's in wrong direction
BTS Feigning again
BTS This command I obeyed
BTS The runners are froze fast
BTS Wolf Larsen had procured a rifle and was throwing a cartridge into the barrel
BTS The very simplicity of his reasoning was its strength and his materialism was far more compelling than the subtly complex materialism of Charley Furuseth
BTS Dr
BTS Look
BTS Matt shrugged his shoulders
BTS The stout wood was crushed like an egg-shell
BTS Men and women devoted their lives to the Cause and new-born babes were sealed to it as of old they had been sealed to the service of God
BTS Cold and grey and glittering they were as he bowed brusquely and turned away
BTS You are too much of a man for ship discipline if that is what you mean and if you know what I mean was Wolf Larsen's retort
BTS and nothing remained to Buck but to recover the bone
BTS So I thought it out at the time feeling the need for vindication and desiring to be at peace with my conscience
BTS The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip
BTS one of the men asked
BTS We had been loafing along till now our sails shaking half the time and spilling the wind
BTS Maud was trembling
BTS Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity
BTS It saddens me and gladdens me the gait with which we are leaving San Francisco behind and with which we are foaming down upon the tropics
BTS There it came now the god's hand cunning to hurt thrusting out at him descending upon his head
BTS Mr
BTS for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished and were enabled to make a long-desired trip into the virgin East where miners had not yet appeared
BTS I was soon to learn
BTS The Black Hundreds were reactionary mobs organized by the perishing Autocracy in the Russian Revolution
BTS But by the very process of unloading the surpluses the resources of those countries are in turn developed
BTS Later on that day Kiche and White Fang strayed into the edge of the woods next to the camp
BTS I laughed bitterly to myself and seemed to find in Wolf Larsen's forbidding philosophy a more adequate explanation of life than I found in my own
BTS but never as now had he faced the possibility of it the eyes of a dozen men fixed upon him silent and waiting
BTS It was I who was now favoured by a quick look
BTS His whole life he had kept aloof from his kind and he still desired to keep aloof
BTS It was the Ghost
BTS And now a large part of the American people must begin to enrich the Rockefellers as soon as the sun goes down no matter what form of illuminant they use
BTS and it was not till we were well settled in our new home that we had opportunity really to wonder and speculate about the Bishop's doings
BTS But there was no rifle-firing for the reason that all their hunters were out in the boats or our prisoners
BTS When viewed in the light of formal logic there is not one thing of which to be ashamed
BTS I had heard it before during the sinking of the Martinez
BTS The time had come
BTS I can shoot you now as I stand here
BTS The muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into the blinding day the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud
BTS The man saved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm but was hurled backward to the floor with Buck on top of him
BTS The day was filled with miserable variety
BTS If he persisted in the truth as he saw it he was doomed to an insane ward
BTS But the dogs could never learn the lesson to leave him alone in camp
BTS His shoulder was exposed
BTS When I was a boy father said I was very curious
BTS They've half got you a'ready a-talkin' like that Henry retorted sharply
BTS It was early in the days of his persecution that he played his first really big crafty game and got there from his first taste of revenge
BTS And they will succeed
BTS He spoke enthusiastically with the love for a fine craft such as some men feel for horses
BTS Buck hurried on swiftly and stealthily every nerve straining and tense alert to the multitudinous details which told a story all but the end
BTS It felt much better the swelling had materially decreased and the cap seemed descending into its proper place
BTS That did not count
BTS He had to ignore the urges and promptings of instinct and reason defy experience give the lie to life itself
BTS Can she get rid of this surplus to the United States
BTS I'd give five hundred dollars though he added just to be aboard the Macedonia for five minutes listening to my brother curse
BTS The bulging back of Cherokee's neck was the only portion of his body that White Fang's teeth could reach
BTS eight millions which he had thought taken care of for years to come at a good interest were suddenly dumped upon his doorstep and there set up a-squawking for a new home
BTS He did not relish my joke
BTS It is dog eat dog and you ate them up
BTS that dog's ben through hell
BTS One of our secret agents was a member of the 'Frisco Reds
BTS The moistness was in her old eyes again and she had to wipe it away before she could go on stitching
BTS It was only a shove a flirt of the wrist yet so tremendous was his strength that I was hurled backward as from a catapult
BTS He ain't down here
BTS You understand seal-hunters are so new and strange to me that I am quite ready to expect anything
BTS I had unloaded the boat and carried its contents high up on the beach where I had set about making a camp
BTS In his youth One Eye had once sniffed too near a similar apparently inert ball of quills and had the tail flick out suddenly in his face
BTS As for you I have for you a deep respect as a scientist
BTS Wolf Larsen gave them little time for thought
BTS Then the end of the thong was given over to him by Grey Beaver
BTS To be brutally beaten to be killed perhaps would not help my case
BTS It was rusty and dull but I turned the grindstone while Louis gave it an edge
BTS Dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice
BTS This book continued to be secretly printed throughout the three centuries of the Iron Heel
BTS The affair was growing mysterious
BTS At ten years of age he had gone to work in the mills and later he served his apprenticeship and became a horseshoer
BTS ' He looked at me curiously
BTS I cried
BTS For myself beyond a word or so of suggestion or correction now and again I took no part
BTS The cub was in a frenzy of terror yet he lay without movement or sound frozen petrified into immobility to all appearances dead
BTS He sprang back bristling and snarling fearful of the unseen and unknown
BTS Ernest's sledge-hammer attack disconcerted him
BTS Think not
BTS It was the Plutocracy through its secret agents that raised the cry that socialism was sacrilegious and atheistic
BTS Then a huge dog was thrust inside and the door was slammed shut behind him
BTS Bill asked anxiously
BTS But he neither snapped nor sprang away
BTS Pike robbed him of half a fish one night and gulped it down under the protection of Buck
BTS The next moment his nose was laid open and he was staggering backward away from the meat
BTS It struck their sense of humor
BTS His hand was heavy
BTS He could take a ptarmigan from its nest kill a rabbit as it slept and snap in mid air the little chipmunks fleeing a second too late for the trees
BTS Here in Sierra Vista which was the name of Judge Scott's place White Fang quickly began to make himself at home
BTS And to clinch the argument there were the several Congressmen who testified to having seen Ernest fumble and drop the bomb
BTS In which case we were another hundred and fifty miles to the bad
BTS for the great Majority of his followers came over to us
BTS There were fierce fighters among them but three battles with the fiercest brought Buck to mastery so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got out of his way
BTS About what
BTS Who is it
BTS The refuges all over the land were quite empty I imagine of comrades that night
BTS Hundreds an' hundreds an' children too
BTS We'll let him run loose and see what kindness can do for him
BTS she drawled
BTS What honest man who is not insane would take lost women and thieves into his house to dwell with him sisterly and brotherly
BTS In the end the god tossed the meat on the snow at White Fang's feet
BTS He clutched its slippery top with both hands releasing Buck and above the roar of the churning water shouted Go Buck
BTS He was regarded as the most fearful of wild beasts and this was borne in to him through the bars of the cage
BTS But it is unlawful was the protest
BTS There were lip-exclamations of approval on the part of the women and hoarser notes of confirmation came from the men
BTS That will shake them to the roots of their primitive natures
BTS There was never any telling what might happen for with live things events were somehow always happening differently
BTS And now it had come
BTS Get down
BTS But with every mishap he was learning
BTS If he didn't bankrupt me with damaged suits the authorities would take him away from me and electrocute him
BTS Thornton shook his head and stepped to Buck's side
BTS Another time when Ernest had just said that the metaphysical philosophers could never stand the test of truth Dr
BTS My mind to me a kingdom is was the answer
BTS An' 'ow yer feelin' now sir
BTS Coarseness and savagery are the inevitable results
BTS And you don't care a cent for what is best for the rest of labor
BTS The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and Buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless
BTS In short I'm going to play the hog myself and not for one day but for the rest of the season if we're in luck
BTS Then a change in their position diverted him
BTS He was given no rest
BTS Throw every year hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of shoes and wheat and clothing and all the commodities of commerce into the sea
BTS I got out the oars and made her row though she was so weak I thought she would faint at every stroke
BTS There were no snap judgments
BTS And it was required of me that this should be the gravest of responsibilities for she was the one woman in the world the one small woman as I loved to think of her
BTS Never had he been so fond of this body of his as now when his tenure of it was so precarious
BTS A couple of bounds a flash of teeth and a frightened squawk and he had scooped in the adventurous fowl
BTS But old One Eye was doubtful
BTS The pack had been loath to forego the kill it had hunted down and it lingered for several minutes making sure of the sounds and then it too sprang away on the trail made by the she-wolf
BTS To the feet was attached the sack of coal which the cook had fetched
BTS From the beginning there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin
BTS Common school education so far as they were concerned had ceased
BTS I remained silent undecided
BTS I felt humble and contrite and was aware of a sweet feeling that Ernest was a sort of father confessor
BTS His school of life had been sterner and he was himself of sterner stuff
BTS Once again he took to wandering in the woods but the wild brother came no more
BTS He knew the hands of the gods their proved mastery their cunning to hurt
BTS The time is not far distant when some unknown will arise in England and the critics will name her the English Maud Brewster
BTS I asked
BTS It was pitiful
BTS For the most part the remaining four hunters leaned on the table or lay in their bunks and left the discussion to the two antagonists
BTS It will not let you destroy the machines
BTS Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it
BTS For the first time in their lives they knew industrial peace
BTS Every man was tearing himself loose even Matthewson
BTS yet it was a token of the fearless companionship with man that was ultimately to be his
BTS I put one hand on the edge of the house to steady myself
BTS and he nodded his head
BTS Because men groping in the Arctic darkness had found a yellow metal and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find thousands of men were rushing into the Northland
BTS But this did not satisfy Weedon Scott
BTS Oofty-Oofty took a turn on a bitt the rope tautened and the Ghost lunging onward jerked the cook to the surface
BTS Yet of the trap and of bondage he knew nothing
BTS And it won't be a guess
BTS In fact toward nightfall of the third day it increased a trifle and something more
BTS Never mind the destruction of life and property
BTS And because we draw upon eternity she retorted
BTS I hope he is not going mad said Weedon's mother
BTS All was confusion and action and every moment life and limb were in peril
BTS Water was not alive
BTS It's a hell of a job Garthwaite grumbled
BTS His newborn cunning gave him poise and control
BTS You have eternal life before you
BTS It was a strength we are wont to associate with things primitive with wild animals and the creatures we imagine our tree-dwelling prototypes to have been a strength savage ferocious alive in itself the essence of life in that it is the potency of motion the elemental stuff itself out of which the many forms of life have been moulded
BTS Or if you do not wish to be boosted just yet why not boost Cooky
BTS I followed at his heels
BTS Satisfied with the honesty of his and the Kanaka's sleep Wolf Larsen passed on to the next two bunks on the starboard side occupied top and bottom as we saw in the light of the sea-lamp by Leach and Johnson
BTS After his condemnation he surrounded himself with a myriad protective devices
BTS There you have it Hump he said closing the book upon his finger and looking up at me
BTS But this love did not come in a day
BTS Notice the sleeve of his left arm Ernest said gently
BTS The growl rose in the throat with the culmination of each forward-pushing movement and ebbed down to start up afresh with the beginning of the next movement
BTS And this message it shall be the duty of the Church to deliver
BTS The sails of the vessel I had seen off to the south-west had grown larger and plainer
BTS Blood and vengeance were in men's hearts
BTS Of course he was not present and of course his judges did not know that he was one of our men
BTS Servile and fawning as he had been before he was now as domineering and bellicose
BTS He might have lived to a ripe old age if he'd stayed at home Henry agreed
BTS It knows for certain more'n a self-respectin' wolf ought to know Henry agreed
BTS Who shipped you anyway
BTS One by one I was at the masthead and saw the six boats disappeared over the bulge of the earth as they followed the seal into the west
BTS Or else you do not know the whole story
BTS It seemed to partake of her soul to have analogous attributes and to link it to life with the slenderest of chains
BTS The Fighting Groups constituted the one thorn in the side of the Iron Heel that the Iron Heel could never remove
BTS Now just for fun
BTS I am inclined to the latter way of accounting for it
BTS and here the episode ended for the time though further developments were yet to take place
BTS You cannot bankrupt him
BTS Why cannot you return
BTS If you will be advised by me this is what you will do
BTS After they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled came back for her and by main strength put her on the sled again
BTS No one more out of environment could be imagined
BTS and innumerable interstices in the walls not so tightly stuffed with moss as Maud had supposed disclosed themselves
BTS His hand went out to mine and as I shook it heartily I could have sworn I saw the mocking devil shine up for a moment in his eyes
BTS One moonlight night running through the quiet forest One Eye suddenly halted
BTS He had broken through the melting snow crust and wallowed while the snowshoe rabbits had skimmed along on top lightly as ever
BTS And in spite of the assuring voice the hand inspired distrust
BTS The hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was
BTS Instead of the great host the Mercenaries had hoped to gather together they succeeded in driving no more than forty thousand of the wretches into the lake
BTS A moment later as I started down the companion stairs to lay the table for dinner I heard him loudly cursing some men amidships
BTS He manoeuvred for the final rush
BTS I could hardly believe my ears
BTS But we've come to it now
BTS It broke us
BTS Pervaise was an American of French descent who in 1913 A
BTS He did not even think the law
BTS He straightened up in time to see a dim form disappearing across the snow into the shelter of the dark
BTS We both laughed at the absurdity and he dropped down to the deck and rested his rifle across the rail
BTS His sister and brother-in-law seconded him
BTS Then he led her to a small pine around which he tied the other string
BTS Hadn't seen it for three years he said
BTS and I can see as I have seen in the past all the marring and mangling of the sweet beautiful flesh and the souls torn with violence from proud bodies and hurled to God
BTS Sights and sounds and scents were familiar to him
BTS He made it
BTS The good stands for all things that bring easement and satisfaction and surcease from pain
BTS The Macedonia repeated her performance of yesterday hogging the sea by dropping her line of boats in advance of ours and across our course
BTS But Maud and I had a way of voicing each other's thoughts and she said as we prepared to hoist the mainsail To think Humphrey you did it all with your own hands
BTS Wouldn't it be better if you went forward say by the steerage companion-way until it is over
BTS and the end of the battle found him again clinging to a hind-leg and furiously growling between his teeth
BTS And he read rightly and he read well
BTS I think I'll go and see
BTS Its apex might be likened to a point
BTS After the simple breakfast capped with a cup of cold water Maud took her lesson in steering
BTS I asked
BTS Many similar outrages that dovetailed with the plot of the revolutionists were given
BTS By means of deck-tackles I had arranged to carry the halyards forward to the windlass
BTS Gif it to heem by Gar
BTS I remember Winters a newspaper fellow with an Alaskan and Siberian reputation
BTS Proofs to the contrary
BTS Spitz was wild with wrath
BTS She was in very good spirits however and made quite merry in accepting our plight as a grave one
BTS White Fang endured it keeping his eyes fixed suspiciously not upon the man that patted him but upon the man that stood in the doorway
BTS Ballingford looked pained then he brightened up and said Granted this horrible picture you have drawn yet you must confess that metaphysics was inherently potent in so far as it drew humanity out of this dark period and on into the illumination of the succeeding centuries
BTS And all the time we were being driven off into the north-east directly away from Japan and toward bleak Bering Sea
BTS And so perished father's book
BTS The fight was growing desperate
BTS Twist it an' you'll choke 'm plentee said Manuel and the stranger grunted a ready affirmative
BTS Scott cried suddenly
BTS This I thought no more than natural considering the part I had played in investigating the case of Jackson's arm
BTS and in return he escaped beatings and his existence was tolerated
BTS How are your headaches
BTS Life in the Northland was simplicity itself when compared with the complicated affairs of Sierra Vista
BTS It was very natural that it should be there how natural I had not imagined until now when I looked upon it with her eyes and knew how strange it and all that went with it must appear to her
BTS Yet nothing had occurred and he was now in splendid trim
BTS she said
BTS Desperate times give need for desperate remedies and the surgeons of the Revolution rose to the need
BTS The beggar came aboard without a cent
BTS Also he learned the value of surprise
BTS He had been transferred from asylum to asylum
BTS It will work I know it will work I cried
BTS After all what censure could be put upon her
BTS They delight in getting trustful-souled gentle reformers before them
BTS Home with you you wolf
BTS The industrial wrong terrible as you say it is is due to ignorance
BTS We with the survivors swept back in mad retreat
BTS Buck writhed his lips into the preliminary of a snarl but sniffed noses with him Whereupon the old wolf sat down pointed nose at the moon and broke out the long wolf howl
BTS She did not snap nor threaten to snap
BTS I can see her now as I write these lines a leap in advance her gray hair flying in thin tangled strings the blood dripping down her forehead from some wound in the scalp in her right hand a hatchet her left hand lean and wrinkled a yellow talon gripping the air convulsively
BTS So it was arranged when I was released at the end of six months that I was to disappear and prepare a secure hiding-place for Ernest
BTS It was not the first time we had put our foot down upon war but it was the first time we had done so in the United States
BTS Far more potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before a seeming familiarity
BTS Never in all his life had he been so vilely treated and never in all his life had he been so angry
BTS Dear heart I am a captain of labor
BTS And in the meanwhile the she-wolf the cause of it all sat down contentedly on her haunches and watched
BTS His fist shot out striking the woman between her burning eyes
BTS But and his voice changed and the light went out of his face what is this condition in which I find myself
BTS While he smelled it he kept his eyes on the god
BTS I like you too well to hurt you he said softly nay there was a tenderness and a caress in his voice that made me wince
BTS He complained of great pain in his head and it was during this period that he arranged a system of communication against the time when speech should leave him altogether one pressure of the hand for yes two for no
BTS Hammerfield's judgment of Ernest which was to the effect that he was an insolent young puppy made bumptious by a little and very inadequate learning
BTS Because he shaved himself with a razor that worked when it removed the hair from his face
BTS This jaw gave the impression of ferocious determination
BTS What d'ye think
BTS Vive la Revolution
BTS Francois leashed them and brought them on deck
BTS I demanded
BTS As Thornton got to his feet Buck seized his mittened hand between his jaws pressing in with his teeth and releasing slowly half-reluctantly
BTS He broke out in mocking laughter then turned his left ear to the pillow as a sign that he wished no further conversation
BTS As it was he struck heavily on his side
BTS First the weeding out from our circles of the secret agents of the Oligarchy
BTS Feet with which to clutch the ground legs to stand on and to help withstand while with arms and hands teeth and nails I struggle to kill and to be not killed
BTS Jes' because he couldn't chew himself loose he chews Spanker loose
BTS Shut the doors and draw the slide Wolf Larsen said to me
BTS Some scow schooner most likely
BTS From a cache behind a hollow rotting log my companion brought out a variety of things--a fifty-pound sack of flour tinned foods of all sorts cooking utensils blankets a canvas tarpaulin books and writing material a great bundle of letters a five-gallon can of kerosene an oil stove and last and most important a large coil of stout rope
BTS Ernest's jaw snapped like a trap
BTS And closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still sounding in the depths of the forest
BTS I cried
BTS The sun had not shone all day and it had been bitter cold
BTS In splendor and in light the Pope passed home
BTS It seemed the breath of his nostrils this carrying his life in his hands and struggling for it against tremendous odds
BTS But it was all forgotten the next moment as he sprang after the she-wolf who was coyly leading him a chase through the woods
BTS Escape was hopeless out of the question
BTS You have proved that to my satisfaction as well as yours
BTS It was an accident
BTS It is true that we smaller capitalists are after profits and that the trusts are taking our profits away from us
BTS and very much alive very much alive
BTS When he saw Pike one of the new dogs a clever malingerer and thief slyly steal a slice of bacon when Perrault's back was turned he duplicated the performance the following day getting away with the whole chunk
BTS This phenomenon was almost as common in the oligarch class and the labor castes as it was in the ranks of the revolutionists
BTS But she thrust him ignominiously away and behind her
BTS Where was her solicitude for me I thought for me whom she had been afraid to have merely peep aboard
BTS But White Fang did not follow them
BTS Take heed gentlemen of the war and navy departments
BTS There was no more reason that I should stand and face these human beasts than that I should stand and face an infuriated bull
BTS Yonson I said
BTS And women there are who become sad when the word goes over the fire of how the Evil Spirit came to select that valley for an abiding-place
BTS She was divinely altruistic and she was a woman
BTS What do you think of that Mr
BTS Speaker and bid them do their work
BTS We are very hospitable upon the Ghost
BTS Men offered odds of two to one that Buck could not budge the sled
BTS Then he was carried aft and flung into the sea
BTS But this was merely a minor detail
BTS He found himself an outcast in the midst of the populous camp
BTS It was not that they were stunned
BTS He had never barked in his life and he could not now learn to bark a welcome when his god approached
BTS but nevertheless a shame rises within me at the recollection and in the pride of my manhood I feel that my manhood has in unaccountable ways been smirched and sullied
BTS Are you all agreed so far
BTS She died in solitary confinement after horrible and prolonged torture
BTS As she squared off more and more escaping from the side pressure she righted herself and broke her deck like a whale's back through the ocean surface
BTS We looked at each other in consternation
BTS The stockyards ghetto plant and everything were smouldering ruins
BTS But I saw the lights of Alcatraz where Ernest lay and found comfort in the thought of nearness to him
BTS I tried to reach it in a mad resolve to claw into the wood with my nails but my arms were heavy and lifeless
BTS I asked in alarm
BTS I have heard the sealers talk about clubbing them
BTS No explanation is made
BTS but White Fang always disappointed them
BTS for I have been with him during these twenty anxious years and I know his patience his untiring effort his infinite devotion to the Cause for which only two months gone he laid down his life
BTS The quivering came to an end suddenly
BTS But Humphrey  she began to protest in a queer husky voice
BTS An' God knows where I'll get another boat-puller
BTS I think nothing but iv my own skin these days was his answer
BTS Van Weyden
BTS It must have tried too the nerves of the red-faced man for I have another picture which will never fade from my mind
BTS The she-wolf was trotting wearily along her mate well in advance when she came upon the overhanging high clay-bank
BTS He was a good shot too and brought many a skin aboard under what the hunters termed impossible hunting conditions
BTS He was too ponderous and slow
BTS Where the bow cut the water there was a great foaming and gurgling and I seemed directly in its path
BTS I'll tell you what to do Ernest said
BTS I shall never forget in that moment how instantly conscious I became of my manhood
BTS While people starved lap-dogs were waited upon by maids
BTS Come get to work Doctor
BTS But Wolf Larsen did not follow me up
BTS But I answered honestly If it were any other captain except ours I should say you would be ashore in Yokohama to-morrow
BTS And in passing I will ask you managers of society why you did not make public the census figures of 1910
BTS We walked to the break of the poop where she turned and faced me
BTS For some time we remained in this position without a change in the situation
BTS Only one thing was clear to him and that was that he had not got any damages
BTS He couldn't work if it weren't for capital the Bishop interrupted
BTS I smiled proudly at her too proudly for she dropped her eyes and was for the moment silent
BTS Kowalt spoke
BTS Capital will not consume this balance because already according to its nature it has consumed all it can
BTS and considering the weak and famished condition of the pack he possessed more than the average vigour and spirit
BTS And still there was that hint of the feebleness of the blind in his walk
BTS You are metaphysicians
BTS Once in the pursuit of a rabbit which she ordinarily would have caught with ease she gave over and lay down and rested
BTS But White Fang learned to omit these preliminaries
BTS the other demanded aggressively
BTS Another disconcerting thing was that it made no outcry such as he had been accustomed to with the other dogs he had fought
BTS he cried
BTS But worse than all this was the atmosphere in which he lived
BTS Beside her on the floor was a pile of trousers
BTS Furthermore he was sleepy
BTS Very true Mr
BTS it is the head of the Rockefeller chain of banks which includes fourteen banks and trust companies in New York City and banks of great strength and influence in every large money center in the country
BTS The cries of Sedition
BTS and here were many Indians much food and unprecedented excitement
BTS I think I too cried aloud as I drew the knife at my hip and sprang forward a second time
BTS He picked it up in his mouth
BTS Also she was compelled to let her great colonies slip away from her
BTS The gang-plank was hauled in and the Aurora swung out from the bank
BTS Wright United States Commissioner of Labor is responsible for the statement
BTS And then I think of my daughter and I cannot work
BTS As a rule Perrault travelled ahead of the team packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them
BTS They rushed bellowing at him
BTS But this time Beauty Smith left him tied with a stick
BTS After all she was only a woman crying her relief now that the danger was past in the arms of her protector or of the one who had been endangered
BTS I was in fear that a struggle might take place but a cry from the helmsman made it easy for the situation to save itself
BTS And then my arm was chewed off
BTS I wrote a quiet restrained dispassionate account of Jackson's case
BTS Now get that sail down and come alongside
BTS I told you it was hopeless Matt Scott said in a discouraged voice
BTS The day wore along and nothing rewarded his hunt
BTS You fellows have a snap
BTS His tongue had tricked him
BTS Their policy is to print nothing that is a vital menace to the established
BTS He could turn and whirl swiftly enough but White Fang was never there
BTS Each shift brought the grip closer to his throat
BTS The next instant Weedon Scott had White Fang by the throat and was dragging him clear
BTS Boarded me in the night with only the watch on deck
BTS At last he lay at the master's feet into whose possession he now surrendered himself voluntarily body and soul
BTS And what good are they
BTS An idealistic monist who long puzzled the philosophers of that time with his denial of the existence of matter but whose clever argument was finally demolished when the new empiric facts of science were philosophically generalized
BTS I never used to be she answered
BTS For weeks and months he never made a sound in the black silence eating his very soul
BTS we were heaped upon the wall of the port cabins as though it had been the deck
BTS There came a day in this land of plenty when the wolf-pack split in half and went in different directions
BTS How was it going to end
BTS At the rear of the sled toiled a second man
BTS To the south a monster conflagration was filling the sky and we knew that the great ghetto was burning
BTS then I whirled around abruptly and confronted--the Bishop
BTS Power it shall be
BTS he shouted hoarsely
BTS Do you mean to tell me that there is no justice in Judge Caldwell's court
BTS What was coming over the man
BTS My heart stole back across wide wastes of years To One who wandered by a lonely sea
BTS Right here I think entered the austere conscience of my Puritan ancestry impelling me toward lurid deeds and sanctioning even murder as right conduct
BTS A third and answering cry arose also to the rear and to the left of the second cry
BTS It had been a bloody strike
BTS I expected him to give orders for the Ghost to heave to but she kept on her course and he made no sign
BTS But it is the asylum that frightens me
BTS I already know he said quietly though his Irish eyes were flashing
BTS The men in the fort disdained the newcomers and enjoyed seeing them come to grief
BTS Rivers and streams that entered the main river he forded or swam
BTS They had travelled little more than a hundred yards when Henry who was in front bent down and picked up something with which his snowshoe had collided
BTS In reality the country was ruled by what were called POLITICAL MACHINES
BTS Larsen asked of me
BTS Sometimes he thought of Judge Miller's big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley and of the cement swimming-tank and Ysabel the Mexican hairless and Toots the Japanese pug
BTS He reached hastily for a brand to throw at her
BTS For we lived on the heights where the air was keen and sparkling where the toil was for humanity and where sordidness and selfishness never entered
BTS There was a way in which it could be done and it remained for me to find that way
BTS Here was little chance for swimming
BTS Out of his puniness and fright he challenged and menaced the whole wide world
BTS Whoso enlists on the side of competition perishes
BTS Seven again
BTS Then came his disillusionment and this disillusionment he described in terms that did not flatter his audience
BTS Reassured he whimpered softly
BTS And in the dirt it shall remain so long as I and mine and those that come after us have the power
BTS The latter was not to be censured for his misjudgment
BTS He learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between his toes
BTS At a political meeting of the socialists where many reporters were present father saw his chance
BTS Life is an offence to it for life is movement
BTS Tackles were made fast and lines flung to the men who scrambled aboard like monkeys
BTS And since he had not taken him with him before so now he could look to be left behind
BTS Get along home
BTS Again the rueful expression came on her face and again I smiled in a superior way
BTS Oh I intend being very careful I answered
BTS And do not forget whenever a churchman does protest that he is discharged
BTS There is no more to tell
BTS I grew to await it with a nameless dread
BTS Recover yourself
BTS This was the pride of Dave as wheel-dog of Sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength
BTS Her simple faith in the immediate future took me aback
BTS It killed her and she was the fastest worker in the shop
BTS and I could see sympathy warm in her eyes
BTS He saw the women and children passing in and out of them without harm and he saw the dogs trying often to get into them and being driven away with sharp words and flying stones
BTS Again from its brumal sleep Wakens the ferine strain
BTS His laughter was Mephistophelian
BTS He did not dare venture away from the gods for now the fangs of all dogs were against him and he tasted to the dregs the persecution that had been White Fang's
BTS It was horrible
BTS She was thrilling to a desire that urged her to go forward to be in closer to that fire to be squabbling with the dogs and to be avoiding and dodging the stumbling feet of men
BTS Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down
BTS As she had saved Dick's life she now saved the groom's
BTS Wolf Larsen will be left a prisoner on board
BTS It no longer required an effort of the vision to see them
BTS What do you propose in order to get rid of the surplus
BTS He looked at them like a drunken man and maundered in strange sleepy speech
BTS And here lying by the river bank through the long spring days watching the running water listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature Buck slowly won back his strength
BTS After that one of two things will happen either the Bishop will see the error of his way and return from his vacation a well man in whose eyes there are no more visions or else he will persist in his madness and then you may expect to see in the papers couched pathetically and tenderly the announcement of his insanity
BTS White Fang was suspicious
BTS eh
BTS But as I descended the companion stairs to clear the table I heard him shriek as the first bucket of water struck him
BTS At the end of half an hour one man stated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds and walk off with it
BTS At such times White Fang leaned in close against the master's legs and received reassuring pats on the head
BTS Nevertheless I forbid you I distinctly forbid your tampering with my ship
BTS Once they came upon a path blazed through the forest an ancient path and the Lost Cabin seemed very near
BTS Only the strong survived
BTS Not only did all forward motion cease but we began to drift back and out to sea
BTS It was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild beasts that prey
BTS A woman in fantastic rags with cheeks cavernously hollow and with narrow black eyes like burning gimlets caught a glimpse of Hartman and me
BTS Then came the suppression of his book
BTS There was no roar and rumble of traffic
BTS Now are we indeed saved
BTS The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost and they seemed to lean towards each other black and ominous in the fading light
BTS I remember one beautiful day when the boats left early and the reports of the hunters' guns grew dim and distant and died away as they scattered far and wide over the sea
BTS Well Spanker's troubles is over anyway
BTS I don't like the looks of it
BTS and besides there was Wolf Larsen's star-scale so simple a device that a child could work it
BTS It dawned upon me that of course the company could afford finer legal talent than could a workingman like Jackson
BTS Outside was the common domain of all gods the roads and streets
BTS He hesitated awkward and bashful shifted his weight from one leg to the other then blunderingly gripped my hand in a hearty shake
BTS His eyes were closed and he was apparently unconscious
BTS For that matter life and footing were synonymous in this unending warfare with the pack and none knew it better than White Fang
BTS And you
BTS He remembered afterwards that his packing had preceded the master's disappearance
BTS Bah
BTS I see you're working my philosophy back on me for all it is worth
BTS Ha
BTS I had a feeling no I don't know what I'm talking about
BTS What I mean is that it was the face of a man who either did nothing contrary to the dictates of his conscience or who had no conscience
BTS Give 'm a chance Matt counselled
BTS One of his attacks I whispered to Maud
BTS The whole realm was his
BTS As the impetus that carried Cherokee forward died down he continued to go forward of his own volition in a swift bow-legged run
BTS It is beyond price which you will acknowledge is a terrific overrating but which I cannot help for it is the life that is in me that makes the rating
BTS Dick on the porch growled and White Fang on the steps bristled and growled back
BTS Life in general might still be sacred but life in the particular case of Thomas Mugridge had become very profane indeed
BTS The Wolf is strong and it's the way of a wolf to hate strength an' strength it is he'll see in Johnson no knucklin' under and a Yes sir thank ye kindly sir' for a curse or a blow
BTS You reminded me for all the world of the scholastics of the Middle Ages who gravely and learnedly debated the absorbing question of how many angels could dance on the point of a needle
BTS He never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word and to sit down for a long talk with them gas he called it was as much his delight as theirs
BTS In face of the facts that modern man lives more wretchedly than the cave-man and that his producing power is a thousand times greater than that of the cave-man no other conclusion is possible than that the capitalist class has mismanaged that you have mismanaged my masters that you have criminally and selfishly mismanaged
BTS It was a female and the law of his kind thrust a barrier between
BTS They're sure goin' to get us Henry
BTS Understand
BTS Lend me a hand
BTS When I came to the United States I hunted up the socialists
BTS He promised to call upon us again
BTS CHAPTER VI By the following morning the storm had blown itself quite out and the Ghost was rolling slightly on a calm sea without a breath of wind
BTS He roared in a ferocious animal-like way and gave me a shove with his hand
BTS As he gave up and stumbled inside his circle a wolf leaped for him missed and landed with all four feet in the coals
BTS I shook my head and regarded their work
BTS He still retained sufficient use of his left arm to do this
BTS It is a feeling a sentiment a something based upon illusion and not a product of the intellect at all
BTS If a chemist in New York made a new discovery in say radium all his expenses across the continent were paid and as well he received a princely fee for his time
BTS An' 'twas me you hit of course Kelly seconded his face brightening for the moment
BTS Wolf Larsen looked savagely at the vessel while Maud Brewster was curious
BTS He stood on his own legs
BTS By the last guns the boats were bearing away slightly to the south'ard
BTS Very good the Bishop interposed
BTS She brushed her hand across her forehead in a puzzled way saying Still I do not understand
BTS He did not know there was any outside at all
BTS Germany Italy France and all Australasia were labor countries--socialist states
BTS Leach had evidently done his task with a thoroughness that Mugridge had not forgiven for words followed and evil names involving smirched ancestries
BTS I'll make them snarl like wolves
BTS That was the most incongruous of all--the overalls frayed at the bottoms dragged down at the heels and held up by a narrow leather belt around the hips such as laborers wear
BTS Scott sprang toward him drawing his fist back to strike
BTS He waited until he was sure of striking before the squirrel could gain a tree-refuge
BTS He captured the spy and as to what then happened Carlson gave us a fair idea
BTS Then to what end
BTS Sitting on the deck several feet away and watching wistfully was White Fang
BTS The cheeks were sunken and there was a wearied puckered expression on the brow
BTS he asked
BTS The light drew them as if they were plants
BTS It is said that when prosperity a few years ago enabled the farmers to rid themselves of their mortgages John D
BTS Take him outside
BTS Flinging his brands at the nearest of his enemies the man thrust his smouldering mittens into the snow and stamped about to cool his feet
BTS We shall be robbed of our few remaining liberties
BTS You could as easily control a lion while he would make a mock of you
BTS I felt myself a match for the most ferocious bull in the herd and I know had such a bull charged upon me that I should have met it unflinchingly and quite coolly and I know that I should have killed it
BTS And when on the still cold nights he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and wolflike it was his ancestors dead and dust pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him
BTS When the two vessels were half-a-mile apart a third shot made another hole in our mainsail
BTS Mit-sah resembled his father much of whose grey wisdom he possessed
BTS He was lying on his side dead where he had dragged himself an arrow protruding head and feathers from either side of his body
BTS He had kept up exercise during the whole period of confinement and his muscles were like iron
BTS But when the love-master spoke White Fang came to him with prompt obedience
BTS Pretty
BTS In the afternoon Smoke and Henderson fell foul of each other and a fusillade of shots came up from the steerage followed by a stampede of the other four hunters for the deck
BTS So often did this happen that it became the custom to hold White Fang until the other dog went through its preliminaries was good and ready and even made the first attack
BTS Many efforts were made during this period to organize the perishing farmer class into a political party the aim of which was destroy the trusts and corporations by drastic legislation
BTS Later when we went back into the world we were separated much
BTS But the man never turned and after stretching his arms above his head and yawning audibly he retraced his steps to the forecastle scuttle and disappeared
BTS He spoke softly to White Fang until he had quieted him then his voice became firm
BTS He crawled frantically clear of the water and lay down
BTS Again I turned my face to leeward and again I saw the jutting promontory black and high and naked the raging surf that broke about its base and beat its front high up with spouting fountains the black and forbidden coast-line running toward the south-east and fringed with a tremendous scarf of white
BTS Not a drop of liquor passed his lips
BTS Biedenbach with tears in his eyes held that Wickson must die and was quite relieved when we outvoted him and his horrible proposition
BTS It would not work
BTS but I confess my heart was in my mouth as I thought of going through the heart of that monstrous herd
BTS he demanded
BTS He had waited too often and futilely in the past for porcupines to unroll to waste any more time
BTS There was no whimpering nor wailing
BTS To have a full stomach to doze lazily in the sunshine such things were remuneration in full for his ardours and toils while his ardours and tolls were in themselves self-remunerative
BTS This occurred with great frequency for once in full cry the dogs were prone to forget themselves in the excitement of the chase while White Fang never forgot himself
BTS He fought from sheer joy finding in it an expression of much that he felt and that otherwise was without speech
BTS Fallacy upon fallacy
BTS Mebbe he is going to die
BTS He had driven the machine out there with despatches on the afternoon of the third day
BTS His lips were on mine before I could protest or resist
BTS Maud looked despair but I laughed and said it would do just as well
BTS There was a shaking of heads and mutterings arose
BTS From the man's distorted body and twisted mind in occult ways like mists rising from malarial marshes came emanations of the unhealth within
BTS The Grangers have come over to us the farmers the middle class and the laborers
BTS There was nothing threatening about her
BTS It was the first of the many fights he was to have with Lip-lip for they were enemies from the start born so with natures destined perpetually to clash
BTS She's the decoy for the pack
BTS You are not sure of it
BTS I don't know he answered shaking his head
BTS In all the days he had lived it had not worked so hard as on this one day
BTS Wolf Larsen in large doses I murmured before and after taking
BTS White Fang resisted it
BTS But we ain't got people an' money an' all the rest like him Henry rejoined
BTS These reactionary groups attacked the revolutionary groups and also at needed moments rioted and destroyed property so as to afford the Autocracy the pretext of calling out the Cossacks
BTS And yet he left the chair in full leap without first gaining a standing position
BTS Two things I had acquired by my accident an injured knee-cap that went undressed and from which I suffered for weary months and the name of Hump which Wolf Larsen had called me from the poop
BTS We'll stand watches just as they do on ships
BTS I went up the steerage companion-way two steps at a time with nothing distinct in my mind except joy and the hope that Maud would sleep on until the surprise breakfast was quite ready for her
BTS We held a housewarming in my hut the night it was roofed
BTS As it was the situation was approaching a stage which I was afraid to consider
BTS But with the other foreman I had better luck
BTS I am like a sober man looking upon drunken men and greatly weary wishing he too were drunk
BTS Guess he don't hear us yet
BTS Our brave comrades are coming Hartman said
BTS Society has spoken
BTS Their children--always the young life that it is their instinct to protect
BTS Louis came aft to relieve the wheel
BTS He took the meat into his mouth and swallowed it
BTS The hands of society are harsh and this man was a striking sample of its handiwork
BTS The idea was that the empty train should receive the disaster were an attempt made to blow up the Twentieth Century
BTS The oligarchs did not dare permit the telling of the whole truth
BTS God
BTS A cheap cotton shirt with frayed collar and a bosom discoloured with what I took to be ancient blood-stains was put on me amid a running and apologetic fire of comment
BTS Also he saw one dog that would neither conciliate nor obey finally killed in the struggle for mastery
BTS Beyond a growl or a grunt the dog took its punishment silently
BTS for these dogs and men were not town dogs and men
BTS Moss would never do
BTS The whole middle class had not yet been exterminated
BTS He never believed in jumping to conclusions
BTS Talk with more of them
BTS A moisture came into his eyes and as the whipping continued he arose and walked irresolutely up and down
BTS Partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the forest
BTS and as I looked at the gleam of triumph in Wolf Larsen's eyes his form swam before me and I felt almost irresistibly impelled to fling myself upon him
BTS Nor to this day can I permit my manhood to look back upon those events and feel entirely exonerated
BTS The lightened sled bounded on its side behind them
BTS At least I shall understand a great deal more of life
BTS Francois knew he was behind all the trouble and Buck knew he knew
BTS From the camp came the faint sound of many voices rising and falling in a sing-song chant
BTS In the meantime the newspapers were read at Sierra Vista not so much with interest as with anxiety
BTS There is no difference except that we have eaten more and better
BTS Calvin asked incredulously
BTS Without doubt she here refers to the Chicago Commune
BTS She nodded emphatically
BTS Why should I deny myself the joy of exciting Leach's soul to fever-pitch
BTS This was his severest fight and though in the end he killed them both he was himself half killed in doing it
BTS There he wandered for a week seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother killing his meat as he travelled and travelling with the long easy lope that seems never to tire
BTS There you are
BTS Mercy was a thing reserved for gentler climes
BTS From the moment he left the tent to when he entered it again Buck would follow at his heels
BTS Cheer up
BTS Their bodies were covered with fur and soft-tanned leather
BTS Not fat old Louis I promise you he laughed
BTS But it was then that the unexpected happened the thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future past many a weary mile of trail and toil
BTS and now I hoisted the mainsail peak and throat at the same time
BTS Who's look-out
BTS At six feet the panicky thought rushed into my mind What if he will not run
BTS Ernest warned
BTS He moulded it like clay twisted and distorted it like a Chinese puzzle into any design he chose
BTS By easy stages we smuggled him along our underground railway to the Carmel refuge
BTS It had prepared for the outbreak and the killing of so many officers gave it justification for what followed
BTS The bullets we had received had travelled nearly a mile but by now we had cut that distance in half
BTS They were thoroughly organized and well armed and they were held in readiness to be hurled in special trains to any part of the country where labor went on strike or was locked out by the employers
BTS The bravest and the most combative and self-sacrificing of our comrades went into the Fighting Groups
BTS But timid he was not
BTS So he was content when he had overthrown and slashed wide the throat of one of their dogs to drop back and let the pack go in and do the cruel finishing work
BTS The suddenness of it was stunning
BTS They live for their belly's sake and the belly is for their sake
BTS This was beyond the scheme of the Iron Heel for the agents-provocateurs had done their work too well
BTS Come in with the dogs at feedin' time
BTS but he was cold under it all and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away
BTS Believe me the working class will continue to do without you
BTS He suddenly thrust his head forward and nudged his way in between the master's arm and body
BTS CHAPTER III THE GOD'S DOMAIN Not only was White Fang adaptable by nature but he had travelled much and knew the meaning and necessity of adjustment
BTS Did you know that you were brave
BTS I asked
BTS They're goin' to get us
BTS He was not a free agent Ernest said
BTS Not only that but he is very lonely
BTS Before ever the thought of wonder cities like Ardis and Asgard entered the minds of the oligarchs Everhard saw those cities and the inevitable necessity for their creation
BTS Ernest had largely planned the First Revolt and the date set had been somewhere early in the spring of 1918
BTS You are travelling the same path that Bishop Morehouse is and toward a similar smash-up
BTS Mugridge who during all the time he had been compelled to cook and serve coffee and keep the fire going had complained of internal pains now swore that he had a broken rib or two
BTS Grey Beaver picked up the paddle
BTS No wrathful Macedonia broke its surface nor blackened the sky with her smoke
BTS I asked Johnson whom I took and rightly to be one of the sailors
BTS Whatever it was I knew that it was climbing aboard by the log-line
BTS In fact in his boyhood before he had been named Beauty by his fellows he had been called Pinhead
BTS There is not enough work for the young
BTS Buck's one hundred and forty pounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen
BTS I feared greatly that she might die in the night
BTS He perceived and determined and responded in the same instant
BTS James Farley--a notorious strike-breaker of the period
BTS Mugridge menaced with the knife he was sharpening for me
BTS Just precisely what do you mean when you call us metaphysicians
BTS The foresail and fore-topsail emptied of the wind by the manoeuvre and with no one to bring in the sheet in time were thundering into ribbons the heavy boom threshing and splintering from rail to rail
BTS So you've changed your mind
BTS There seemed something missing in my environment
BTS Ever in his ears was sounding her sharp and nervous snarl
BTS And then when the labor leaders had left Ernest with the calmness of defeat outlined to me the course of events to come
BTS It was their instinct
BTS Giving over his attempt to determine the shadow he stepped on deck and started forward walking with a swiftness and confidence which surprised me
BTS I might have knowed it Bill chided himself aloud as he replaced the gun
BTS Help me to a seat he said in the same hoarse frightened voice
BTS He loved to run down dry watercourses and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the woods
BTS Why do you Mr
BTS or he would crouch for hours as if in concealment behind fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees wide-eyed and wide-eared to all that moved and sounded about him
BTS In fact I was vivisecting him and turning over his soul-stuff as keenly and thoroughly as it was his custom to do it to others
BTS If we cannot sail away on the Ghost we may remain for years on the island for life even
BTS Serve you bloody well right if yer neck was broke
BTS And the change was to me likewise adventure and the greatest of all for it was love-adventure
BTS But he did not know why he did these various things
BTS Every time he was thus awakened he drove back the wolves with flying brands replenished the fire and rearranged the pine-knot on his hand
BTS She nodded her head
BTS Then Scott looked around the room
BTS That they'd come aboard and cut our throats
BTS And for their less fortunate brothers and sisters the unfavored laborers the driven people of the abyss they cared nothing
BTS And in the silence he asked again Well
BTS Henry stopped eating to glance across the fire and count the dogs
BTS and because of this they became sharp of speech and hard words were first on their lips in the morning and last at night
BTS No visitors were allowed while it was the Philomath's policy to permit none of its discussions to get into the papers
BTS I asked
BTS Finally an idea came to him
BTS the faro-dealer demanded
BTS He towered like a Goliath above Wolf Larsen
BTS After a time the voices died away and some time after that he crept out to enjoy the success of his undertaking
BTS Members of the favored unions told their wives and the wives gossiped and soon all the labor world knew what had happened
BTS What did they want with him these strange men
BTS In the first place his clothes did not fit him
BTS He made no reply
BTS It was a seal-hunting boat she replied and you know perfectly well that if the men had escaped they would have been back to make their fortunes from the rookery
BTS Baseek was surprised by the other's temerity and swiftness of attack
BTS It was unparalleled undreamed-of that I Humphrey Van Weyden a scholar and a dilettante if you please in things artistic and literary should be lying here on a Bering Sea seal-hunting schooner
BTS You've learned your place and I know mine
BTS Not the least bit
BTS Amidst the crashing of the middle men the small business men and manufacturers the trusts stood firm
BTS And like all succeeding wolves and wild dogs that had done likewise White Fang worked the covenant out for himself
BTS He would bark and dance about in front of the bull just out of reach of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have stamped his life out with a single blow
BTS But there were two other hands I answered
BTS Then the sled lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks though it never really came to a dead stop again
BTS I'll beat you out though brother mine he chuckled
BTS Then I saw Henderson leaping like a madman for the main rigging up which he shot on the inside till he was many feet higher than my head
BTS It was soft and bled easily
BTS Had they remained on the solid earth they would have found it easily enough--ay they would have found that they themselves were precisely testing truth with every practical act and thought of their lives
BTS The railroad gets my profit
BTS and their little puppet-bodies crawled blindly and chemically like the tendrils of a vine
BTS He spoke in a far-away manner of his illness and we talked disjointedly about the church the alterations in the organ and about petty charities
BTS In the meantime Bill had bethought himself of the rifle
BTS I'm not worth that much
BTS While as for getting him off his feet there was no dog among them capable of doing the trick
BTS for Buck made three of him in weight while his head barely reached Buck's shoulder
BTS At first I covered my eyes with my hands to shut out the awful sight and then in the darkness the question came to me What is to be done
BTS I shall never walk again
BTS And as I looked at him I was aware of a great joy
BTS Four billion dollars has been produced
BTS CHAPTER IV THE CALL OF KIND The months came and went
BTS I understand I said
BTS For the first time I was seeing life
BTS and her present litter of puppies gave her the right to resent such intrusion
BTS Yes Maud announced
BTS The papers made no mention of the book but they misreported him beautifully
BTS It prepared to go on with its book publishing
BTS see
BTS Couldn't miss it
BTS Everybody was excited and belligerent
BTS Calvin said tartly
BTS I cried
BTS We captured the state legislature of Oregon and put through splendid protective legislation and it was vetoed by the governor who was a creature of the trusts
BTS And of what use has it been
BTS but to not crawl to be as the clod and rock is loathsome to contemplate
BTS Instructing her how to hold the turn and be ready to slack away at command I laid hold of the mast with my hands and tried to balance it inboard across the rail
BTS It was a task requiring the utmost nicety and precision and I could not but admire the way he tempered his strength to the fineness and delicacy of the need
BTS An' there was a man the same year he killed with a blow iv his fist
BTS The number of the assailants was a cause of confusion
BTS but once around the second and we went perilously near we picked up the third headland still in line with the wind and with the other two
BTS He obeyed but with a rush hurling himself upon the stranger who was dragging him away
BTS He was thinking rapidly
BTS I can remember I can think and reason
BTS He had learned to laugh
BTS Look at Major the other rejoined
BTS I remain silent and suffer ignominy as you will remain silent and suffer ignominy
BTS Wolf Larsen looked curiously at him as though about to probe and vivisect him then changed his mind as from the foregone conclusion that there was nothing there to probe
BTS Wickson did not send for father
BTS The tent they had discarded at Dyea in order to travel light
BTS Ernest shrugged his shoulders
BTS The wagon-road became a wood-road the wood-road became a cow-path and the cow-path dwindled away and ceased among the upland pastures
BTS The first struck fifty feet to windward of the boat the second alongside
BTS A fresh breeze was blowing and for a time I was alone in the moist obscurity yet not alone for I was dimly conscious of the presence of the pilot and of what I took to be the captain in the glass house above my head
BTS A sudden frightful expression distorted his well-bred face
BTS Salmon Tongue's hand reached out to him and rolled him over on his back
BTS And yet you call me anarchist
BTS Consider that I am smiling now
BTS Mugridge on deck in the hands of a couple of grinning sailors who had been told off for the purpose
BTS With the Judge's sons hunting and tramping it had been a working partnership
BTS and often blinking by the fire Buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered
BTS Grey Beaver defended White Fang
BTS It means we'll have to marry earlier than you planned was Ernest's comment when we told him
BTS but for you it will be an excellent object lesson
BTS They were the lawful prey of any dog
BTS This is news to me was the answer
BTS Further he was more directly connected with the Wild than they
BTS There was food
BTS Comrade Biedenbach did not betray the Cause
BTS Up that staircase the way led to the love-master and to the love-master's dearest possessions
BTS Her beam or width is twenty-three feet and her length a little over ninety feet
BTS There was now much resting and sleeping
BTS It was no light adventure this trusting ourselves in a small boat to so raw and stormy a sea and it was imperative that we should guard ourselves against the cold and wet
BTS I'll be ding-dong-danged if I do
BTS The Outsides were timid and frightened the Insides without confidence in their masters
BTS I know you have it in for me Johnson continued with his unalterable and ponderous slowness
BTS White Fang was in splendid condition
BTS And if the Plutocracy gets you first why it's only a matter of time when the Proletariat gets the Plutocracy
BTS Walking right along
BTS The hunting was perilous
BTS She turned and looked me in the eyes
BTS When he started up the companion-way I retreated silently rolling over on top of the cabin
BTS You make me sick
BTS I held on to the rail with one hand and supported her weight with the other and I was proud at the moment of the feat
BTS Something is burning Maud said with sudden conviction
BTS They were awed so still and large he stood and a moment's pause fell till the boldest one leaped straight for him
BTS And Buck ran with them side by side with the wild brother yelping as he ran
BTS He sat for a long while upon the sled
BTS The rest of mankind was as nothing
BTS In fact they were badly wounded and having thrashed them he proceeded to operate upon them in a rough surgical fashion and to dress their wounds
BTS She shrugged her shoulders
BTS It had welded into one compact political mass the whole of North America from the Panama Canal to the Arctic Ocean
BTS One Eye was hungry
BTS And he drew the parallel and included me guilty of a similar act
BTS but they were silenced when the newcomer lifted his head from his work for a moment and glared at them
BTS This was her day and it came not often when manes bristled and fang smote fang or ripped and tore the yielding flesh all for the possession of her
BTS The next moment she was at his throat her teeth buried in his hair and flesh
BTS When the time was ripe the spies were thrown off my track
BTS ' But I disagree with you the Bishop interposed his pale ascetic face betraying by a faint glow the intensity of his feelings
BTS It was the way he had learned
BTS so that he was glad to go back to his revolutionists who were clean noble and alive and all that the capitalists were not
BTS Well well
BTS I instance this to show the sensitiveness of my nervous organization at the time and how unused I was to spectacles of brutality
BTS And then she would be up on her feet and toiling hard as ever
BTS He called his comrades to witness the sight
BTS Diamonds and rubies are gone spread out on the deck to be washed away by a bucket of sea-water and he does not even know that the diamonds and rubies are gone
BTS A little rope-work sail-making and experience with storms and such things and by the end of the voyage you could ship on any coasting schooner
BTS I don't like the look of it
BTS He stood high in the councils of the socialist party was one of the leaders and was the acknowledged leader in the philosophy of socialism
BTS Three times four times and half a dozen times his sharp little teeth scored on the newcomer until White Fang yelping shamelessly fled to the protection of his mother
BTS You want opportunity to plunder your fellow-men in your own small way but you hypnotize yourselves into thinking you want freedom
BTS While I was rigging it between the top of the spar and the opposite rail Wolf Larsen came on the scene
BTS It was not smoking
BTS Surely you will agree with me
BTS I'll furnish you with cloth needles and thread he added
BTS I could have sworn his face fell at the intelligence but why he should be disappointed I could not conceive
BTS G'wan you Kelly
BTS As I reached the limit of my swing and prepared to rush back on the counter swing a great gong struck and thundered
BTS She crept out cautiously on the edge of a large open space in the midst of the trees
BTS Its serenity and certitude was terrifying
BTS It was at Fort Yukon that White Fang saw his first white men
BTS White Fang turned to the love-master's wife
BTS it's life
BTS He grew maudlin familiar could hardly see the cards or sit upright
BTS Everywhere the socialists proclaimed their coming victory at the ballot-box while in unmistakable terms they stated the situation
BTS On the contrary they devoured their own meat hurriedly for fear that he would take it away from them
BTS Where many another animal would have died or had its spirit broken he adjusted himself and lived and at no expense of the spirit
BTS Without adventure we crossed the United States to California
BTS Blithering idiot
BTS I looked at my watch
BTS when war threatened between Austria and Italy the socialists of Italy Austria and Hungary held a conference at Trieste and threatened a general strike of the workingmen of both countries in case war was declared
BTS When Biedenbach the German terrorist hid with us some time later he installed a smoke-consuming device that enabled us to sit by crackling wood fires on winter nights
BTS The fifty- two socialist Congressmen were confined in military fortresses scattered all over the United States
BTS and Ernest nodded
BTS When you reach out your vaunted strong hands for our palaces and purpled ease we will show you what strength is
BTS It was a pain and an unrest
BTS With the exception of the two mongrels they were bewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in which they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received
BTS but he remained interested in the other sounds faint muffled sobbings and slubberings
BTS He does not lose anything for with the loss of himself he loses the knowledge of loss
BTS I'll have you know that I do the swearing on this ship
BTS The land itself ceased at the county road
BTS Then on the morning of the fourth day two men from the States came along and bought them harness and all for a song
BTS I cannot give the further particulars of the horrible scene that followed
BTS Each day pursuing him and crying defiance at him the lesson of the previous night was erased and that night would have to be learned over again to be as immediately forgotten
BTS From him White Fang had learned much of his own insignificance
BTS He became cat-like in his ability to stay on his feet
BTS She looked at me and I looked inquiry back
BTS sitting down in the coal-box and nursing his new hurt by rocking back and forth
BTS It was necessary for us to practise until our assumed roles became real
BTS The team of ten dogs was unhitched and Buck with his own harness was put into the sled
BTS He had been used always to the laboratory and so it was that he turned the dining room into a sociological laboratory
BTS Here stood the old Hudson's Bay Company fort
BTS Half-a-dozen sailors swarmed to the crosstrees after him where they clustered and waited while two of their number Oofty-Oofty and Black who was Latimer's boat-steerer continued up the thin steel stays lifting their bodies higher and higher by means of their arms
BTS He was describing the sufferings of the unemployed as if with the wild idea of in some way touching their hearts and consciences
BTS The box was empty
BTS Then as the short day waned we fell to discussing Wolf Larsen's blindness
BTS Van Weyden
BTS That explained it all
BTS Then he smelled the strange fabric saturated with the man-smell
BTS It must have been latent savagery stirring in me for the old words so bound up with the roots of the race to grip me and thrill me
BTS What's the matter
BTS But Mercedes interfered crying Oh Hal you mustn't as she caught hold of the whip and wrenched it from him
BTS But they'll come to it they'll come to it an' be sorry the day they was born
BTS Wickson looked at me sharply when I closed the door on him and muttered 'Well I'll be damned
BTS The wind would instantly capsize the boat
BTS At any rate it was a lie
BTS As never before he felt his dependence on the love-master close at whose heels he followed no matter what happened never losing sight of him
BTS They're wrong all wrong of course and contrary to reason
BTS Kind of evened up the score a bit
BTS We refuse to perish
BTS He did not calculate such things
BTS and for weeks upon end they would camp here and there the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire
BTS I was proud that it did mean something to me and for the first time in a weary while I was convincingly conscious of a superiority over him
BTS He outlined the evidence I was to give
BTS This railroad magnate broke his word as a citizen as a gentleman and as a Christian when he granted a secret rebate and he granted many secret rebates
BTS It is an unprecedented thing I take it for a captain to be chummy with the cook
BTS He looked his captain in the eyes and replied slowly I am going to get that boy down
BTS But to return to my indictment
BTS But wait till they get to cutting up iv jinks and rowin' 'round
BTS She was in striking contrast to Wolf Larsen
BTS Forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence
BTS Ernest said suddenly to Mr
BTS Well in a way there has come to be a sort of connection I answered unsurprised by this time at such gaps in his vocabulary which like his knowledge was the acquirement of a self-read self-educated man whom no one had directed in his studies and who had thought much and talked little or not at all
BTS But you can't break the machines Ernest replied
BTS Life had always seemed a peculiarly sacred thing but here it counted for nothing was a cipher in the arithmetic of commerce
BTS But he sprang upon the guard one day and used his teeth on the other's throat just like any jungle animal
BTS He could do nothing to defend himself
BTS With you socialists to back us we'll make them sing another song when we take office
BTS In turn he was an object of great curiosity to them
BTS Nevertheless he felt a little prick of ambition a sneaking desire to have another battle with that ptarmigan hen only the hawk had carried her away
BTS Humanity would be better and happier for it life fairer and sweeter
BTS She said this last proudly
BTS In many places scattered over the country slave revolts and massacres had occurred
BTS White Fang whined as he watched the operation
BTS In a dozen states the revolt flared up
BTS The Canadian Government would be no loser nor would its despatches travel the slower
BTS The magnitude of the task may be understood when it is taken into
BTS And I promise I won't use any more physical demonstrations
BTS I demanded
BTS Wilfully had it disobeyed and won my eyes to speech and now it was winning my tongue ay and my lips for they were mad this moment to kiss the two small hands which had toiled so faithfully and hard
BTS The working class has done without you
BTS All this the two men saw in the first instant
BTS She was not running straight for us but ahead of us
BTS And yet you think Jackson had the right of it
BTS But don't try it on Wolf Larsen
BTS Scott
BTS of myself unable to read or write cabin-boy at the mature age of ten on the coastwise old-country ships
BTS There were seven all together including him
BTS And yet I wrestled with myself and could not pull the triggers
BTS But this was no canyon
BTS One Eye approached carefully but hopelessly
BTS He looked at her quickly half-hopefully and then said all regretfully Too late
BTS Van Weyden
BTS You are now on an unsubstantial basis
BTS But there is Captain Larsen she objected
BTS She sneezed continually and her stub of a tail was doing its best toward lashing about by giving quick violent jerks
BTS It would have required an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright and Hal was not such a man
BTS Her sister seconded her and a chorus of approval arose from around the table
BTS The day following I was desperate and I rafted together the foremast the fore and main booms and the fore and main gaffs
BTS He held on to the wing and growled between his tight-clenched teeth
BTS Here was danger some treachery or something
BTS Oh I'm going to be married I answered lightly and then I'll be out of it all
BTS A call from the mate interrupted the gory narrative and Harrison went aft
BTS and this be the sign of it
BTS Hammerfield muttered lamely
BTS But White Fang's reprisals did not cease even when the young dogs had learned thoroughly that they must stay together
BTS He could make a louder rasping growl than any of them
BTS Maud saw that I had achieved a solution and her eyes warmed sympathetically
BTS Bill demanded triumphantly
BTS I had always conceived a burial at sea to be a very solemn and awe-inspiring event but I was quickly disillusioned by this burial at any rate
BTS And to do them justice they honestly believed that the act was to be committed by the socialists
BTS no eighty-two eh
BTS Occasionally it came up too close or fell off too freely
BTS Judge Scott did not know all things and he did not know that he was party to a police conspiracy that the evidence was hatched and perjured that Jim Hall was guiltless of the crime charged
BTS But no village greeted his eyes
BTS He almost fell backward and swayed from side to side in an effort to recover his balance
BTS The scientist reasons inductively from the facts of experience
BTS Dis is de las'
BTS My bruised and swollen hands could no longer close on the oar handles
BTS He was also puzzled
BTS The Bishop discovered there was neither coal nor kindling and went out to buy some
BTS It partook of the magnitude and volume of distant thunder and it came to us directly from leeward rising above the crash of the surf and travelling directly in the teeth of the storm
BTS It bid fair to destroy for me all that was best and brightest in life
BTS They ran many miles that day
BTS He made it clear to Buck that he was to come and they ran side by side through the sombre twilight straight up the creek bed into the gorge from which it issued and across the bleak divide where it took its rise
BTS Then after the break-up of the ice on the Porcupine he had built a canoe and paddled down that stream to where it effected its junction with the Yukon just under the Artic circle
BTS The sapling remained bent above him
BTS The western half of the sky had by now grown murky
BTS The German socialists were ready to act with us
BTS It's meself that knows
BTS But White Fang refused to growl
BTS I had not looked at it in that light the Bishop said naively
BTS He is very sick and worse than that he has got out of hand
BTS In spite of his belief in it he worked like a giant against it and he more than any man has made possible the revolt that even now waits the signal to burst forth
BTS Take me ashore
BTS The case of this young man was not unusual
BTS spluttered the Skookum Bench king
BTS It was as though he had no brain
BTS Not permitted himself to run with the pack the curious state of affairs obtained that no member of the pack could run outside the pack
BTS Louis gazing fixedly betrayed a trouble in his face he was not quite able to hide
BTS Dick's overtures bothered him so he snarled Dick away
BTS The plot of necessity was frightfully intricate and anything premature was sure to destroy it
BTS His calculation of the membership of these divisions by occupation from the United States Census of 1900 is as follows Plutocratic class 250251
BTS But it is not easy for you to find all of three dollars every month
BTS Ernest demanded
BTS He was becoming more morose more uncompanionable more solitary more ferocious
BTS She shook her head decidedly and Charles and Hal put the last odds and ends on top the mountainous load
BTS CHAPTER III JACKSON'S ARM
BTS Step by step by the might of his arms the whole pack of men striving to drag him back and down he drew his body up from the floor till he stood erect
BTS In fact the Iron Heel was preparing to make the abysmal beast roar
BTS But the wolf fled at sight of him
BTS But these things had not been so
BTS It was done so easily after all I remarked
BTS He jerked his shoulder petulantly away from the grip of his questioner
BTS The socialists were in a pitiful minority and they knew that their end was near
BTS What place is this
BTS was the dog-musher's expression of astonishment
BTS While he went wild with happiness when Thornton touched him or spoke to him he did not seek these tokens
BTS and it was for this reason when the Second Revolt was crushed that they too were crushed by the united oligarchies of the world their socialist governments being replaced by oligarchical governments
BTS It was made of stout birch-bark and its full surface rested on the snow
BTS And I do not think there was one who would have interfered had we closed in a death-struggle
BTS It was Wolf Larsen's last word bosh sceptical and invincible to the end
BTS All would be well
BTS Unseen and occultly the gods still gripped with their power and would not let her go
BTS And it was he who increased the pace when he sighted the she-wolf now trotting slowly across the snow
BTS But I soothed and comforted her till she pulled herself bravely together and recuperated mentally as quickly as she was wont to do physically
BTS Fallacy upon fallacy
BTS Garthwaite had not returned
BTS An hour later Avis Everhard was no more
BTS Often the streets were blocked by mountains of debris that compelled us to go around
BTS many others had been sentenced to prison while thousands of the rank and file of the strikers had been herded into bull-pens and abominably treated by the soldiers
BTS It was later in the day that he took me in his arms manifesting great embarrassment and claiming polygamous emotions
BTS I rolled my head negatively on the floor
BTS He swept his arm in an impatient gesture toward a number of the sailors who were working on some kind of rope stuff amidships
BTS What the devil can I do with a wolf in California
BTS Untermann a revolutionist in July 1903 published a pamphlet at Girard Kansas on the Militia Bill
BTS And as I looked into Maud's clear brown eyes I forgot the evil he had done and I knew only that I loved her and that because of her the strength was mine to win our way back to the world
BTS he added
BTS It's not fair of you was her greeting
BTS This is my father's land and-- But at that moment Biedenbach every polite and gentle said from behind him in a low voice Hands up my young sir
BTS And yet he remained somehow different from other dogs
BTS You noticed yourself the row the dogs made
BTS Had he contented himself with looking fierce and ominous all would have been well
BTS In point of fact the cuff was rarely administered
BTS For the Love of a Man When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson
BTS When White Fang struggled Cherokee was content merely to hold on
BTS It was a very trim and neat little craft
BTS Grave dignified sombre a laugh made him frantic to ridiculousness
BTS and one young hunter hurling a spear at Buck in mid air drove it through the chest of another hunter with such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood out beyond
BTS But no living man had looted this treasure house and the dead were dead
BTS It seemed rather a frank and open countenance which frankness or openness was enhanced by the fact that he was smooth-shaven
BTS They did not know what had become of him
BTS They were limping and staggering
BTS On the contrary it was increasing
BTS Day after day for days unending Buck toiled in the traces
BTS They've got away with better men than you an' me Bill answered
BTS but I made shift with the tin used for bailing the boat and later as we consumed our supply of canned goods we accumulated quite an imposing array of cooking vessels
BTS Thus it was he learned the law and ere he left the domain of the chickens he had learned to ignore their existence
BTS The flood of fight ebbed down in him and releasing his prey he turned tail and scampered on across the open in inglorious retreat
BTS It's only the fleeting form we may demolish
BTS Sacredam
BTS Her eyes looked bravely into mine
BTS A section of the mob tore itself loose and surged in after her
BTS Then he stooped picked it up himself and with two strokes cut Buck's traces
BTS I was one of those that tried him and passed sentence upon him
BTS morally and spiritually they had sickened him
BTS What is the meaning of the fact that to-day the capitalists of the United States own hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of Mexican bonds Russian bonds Italian bonds Grecian bonds
BTS Oh shut up
BTS Every little while however one dog or another would flame up in revolt and be promptly subdued
BTS Then there were a number of grammars such as Metcalf's and Reed and Kellogg's
BTS Once the feeling strong upon me that my little world and all the world was turning over I thought of Ernest as the cause of it
BTS The din was frightful
BTS Oh was all she replied
BTS My rhythm grew shorter and shorter
BTS And you would scarcely demand a little girl of nine to earn her own living
BTS He seemed greatly perturbed unable to reply to me
BTS This house was completely hidden from any chance eye that might peer down from the edge of the hole
BTS Thus he could avoid the leap of another dog or the drive of its fangs and at the same moment could seize the infinitesimal fraction of time in which to deliver his own attack
BTS White Fang was intelligent beyond the average of his kind
BTS There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean
BTS At last organized labor had learned its lesson
BTS Here she comes
BTS You sell a great deal at cut-rates
BTS Torn by his horror of the asylum and his fidelity to truth and the right he clung steadfastly to truth and the right
BTS I had forgotten their existence
BTS Thousands of secret agents were rushed to the devoted city
BTS while my most conservative calculation placed on its beaches two hundred thousand seals
BTS And I shall know that I must die at sea most likely cease crawling of myself to be all a-crawl with the corruption of the sea
BTS and when they come between me and life I out-grip them out-tear them out-destroy them
BTS But the beating
BTS Pike the malingerer who in his lifetime of deceit had often successfully feigned a hurt leg was now limping in earnest
BTS I am glad you are as small a bit as you are I said
BTS But I had not even a moment's indecision
BTS and from one and all the answer will be that there is nothing congruous between the return to nature and socialism
BTS We were talking about this yesterday he said
BTS There seemed untold numbers of these white men
BTS A chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder
BTS His suspicions had been aroused
BTS One Ear was uttering quick eager whines lunging at the length of his stick toward the darkness and desisting now and again in order to make frantic attacks on the stick with his teeth
BTS It was his own fault
BTS They loomed ominously above him
BTS When they were fast bow and stern and the two uninjured men prepared to come aboard the hunter picked up his rifle as if to place it in a secure position
BTS Van Weyden will you take the wheel
BTS He uncoiled his whip
BTS You're a beast
BTS Then it was clear to me some one else had worked and made them and been robbed of them
BTS But what is a dog to know in its consciousness of madness
BTS He never saw the sky nor the sunshine
BTS As for its inventor beyond an increasing deafness and the movement of the lips growing fainter and fainter there had been little change in his condition for a week
BTS It was slow work and perilous and often were our efforts rewarded with costly failures
BTS I agree with you he answered
BTS Because of its strenuous efforts to dispose of the surplus in the world market the Plutocracy clashed with Germany
BTS And Mugridge kicked savagely till the Kanaka hanging on with one hand seized the Cockney's foot with the other
BTS Buck was glad to be gone and though the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it
BTS But disaster had come to the soldiers
BTS But he offered me even better than that--offered to make me president of some great college of physical sciences that is being planned--the Oligarchy must get rid of its surplus somehow you see
BTS Thomas Mugridge on the other hand considered it a laughable affair and was continually bobbing his head out the galley door to make jocose remarks
BTS What was the matter
BTS White Fang sprang in a rage at the throat of the offending horse but was checked by the master's voice
BTS You sir are a poor gamester
BTS Insult in its very nature is emotional
BTS Nig equally friendly though less demonstrative was a huge black dog half bloodhound and half deerhound with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature
BTS But the effect of such a sentiment enunciated by two such powerful social arbiters I underestimated
BTS Thornton stepped well back
BTS It was oil and water and there was no hope for him though for a short period he was a source of serious apprehension to the Plutocrats
BTS The dogs clustered together in fear now and again snarling menacingly as a pair of eyes drew close
BTS In fact this oiliness or greasiness as I was later to learn was probably the most salient expression of his personality
BTS Of course no wireless stations had been blown up
BTS And yet the Trust produces milk more cheaply than could the independent dairymen
BTS Something wriggled under his feet
BTS They had been hogging the sea and they knew Wolf Larsen by reputation at any rate
BTS It's springtime and you won't get any more cold weather the man replied
BTS But I shall be a different women for the experience as well as a stronger woman she answered
BTS More wolves were appearing every moment and joining in the chase
BTS The two men shook hands
BTS White Fang walked stiff-legged up the steps and across the porch with tail rigidly erect keeping his eyes on Dick to guard against a flank attack and at the same time prepared for whatever fierce manifestation of the unknown that might pounce out upon him from the interior of the house
BTS His progress was marked by snarl and snap and growl
BTS Wolf Larsen was still waiting an explanation and I pointed down to my knees
BTS Between White Fang and them existed a neutrality and no more
BTS But he disregarded my protest
BTS Something had gone wrong with him
BTS Very good
BTS He crawled tremblingly to his feet and stood whimpering
BTS The next moment he received a clout alongside the head that knocked him over on his side
BTS The battle began fairly but it did not end fairly
BTS He was astonished
BTS They knew while Ernest was speaking that some violent act was to be committed
BTS For moral courage is a worthless asset on this little floating world
BTS The explosion was ready for the flash of powder and countless agents of the Iron Heel including me either on the ground or being sent there were to supply that flash
BTS Was it not true
BTS But at the end of several minutes two dogs were struggling in the dirt and the third was in full flight
BTS She struck White Fang at right angles in the midst of his spring and again he was knocked off his feet and rolled over
BTS Not that in appearance he seemed in the least gorilla-like
BTS They went their ways with great haste and definiteness withal there was a curious indecision in their movements as though they expected the buildings to topple over on them or the sidewalks to sink under their feet or fly up in the air
BTS The struggle had not lasted more than three minutes
BTS The broad pads of their feet were spread wide and in contact with the snow were like velvet
BTS The champagne is already flat
BTS They are powerful in all the great railways of New York north east and west except one where their share is only a few millions
BTS I had no doubt but that I should come through somehow
BTS In the morning Henry renewed the fire and cooked breakfast to the accompaniment of his partner's snoring
BTS but when he touched her neck gently with his muzzle she snapped at him with such quick fierceness that he tumbled over backward and cut a ridiculous figure in his effort to escape her teeth
BTS It will mend all that is wrong as soon as it receives the message
BTS Nothing remained but to stand still and accept the indignity
BTS Perhaps it was the weight of his hand perhaps his justice perhaps the sheer power of him and perhaps it was all these things that influenced White Fang
BTS The general gloom had gathered me into its folds
BTS The blows increased
BTS I remember the review she went on hastily becoming aware of the awkwardness of her remark
BTS Eh
BTS On the instant the she-wolf's coyness and playfulness disappeared
BTS Then he stopped undecided and looked back over his shoulder
BTS He had a strong constitution
BTS She clumsily hinted as much when she invited me
BTS Forty fifty sixty feet of line ran out when Wolf Larsen cried Belay
BTS He shook his head
BTS The silence was unbroken save by the cries of their pursuers that unseen hung upon their rear
BTS The sled was without runners
BTS There were no more idle-rich young men
BTS One white man having seen his dog a setter torn to pieces before his eyes drew a revolver
BTS And he was aware of it for he said with one of his short laughs Man-play Miss Brewster
BTS They are strong hands
BTS I do no sin for I am true to the promptings of the life that is in me
BTS but the spar righted despite my efforts and dropped back toward the water
BTS I ran forward and had the downhaul of the flying jib all in and fast as we slipped by the boat a hundred feet to leeward
BTS Through the door came a low anxious whine like a sobbing under the breath that had just grown audible
BTS So it was that politicians like Mr
BTS I could not get away from him
BTS Mean what
BTS They turned their shoulders to her most savage slashes and with wagging tails and mincing steps strove to placate her wrath
BTS You have lulled your conscience to sleep with prattle of sweet ideals and dear moralities
BTS White Fang was awed
BTS He shook his head
BTS You cannot diminish the length of his living by killing him for he is without beginning or end
BTS Moose were scarce the rabbits almost disappeared hunting and preying animals perished
BTS As I see it I do wrong always when I consider the interests of others
BTS Leach was the last to go falling sheer back from the top of the scuttle and striking on head and shoulders upon his sprawling mates beneath
BTS He was dominated by this mere flesh-love of life
BTS And I remembered what he had told me that no indictment of their morality could shake them
BTS Hello you husky
BTS and White Fang licked his chops and decided that such fare was good
BTS Which we shall not I know
BTS His attitude was of one looking forward the length of the schooner or staring rather for his eyes were fixed and unblinking
BTS What would happen to me when these men discovered my presence
BTS He continued up the right fork
BTS At night when the sun went down the sheets were slackened
BTS At the head of the room Miss Brentwood introduced him to Colonel Van Gilbert and I knew that the latter was to preside
BTS CHAPTER XXIX Fool
BTS Terror itself and the mystery of the unknown led to his living
BTS The situation was bitter and bloody
BTS But White Fang was here there and everywhere always evading and eluding and always leaping in and slashing with his fangs and leaping out again in time to escape punishment
BTS In ways he was even greater than Ernest than whom I have known none greater
BTS Nor was it my father merely nor the controversial dinners that drew him there
BTS God
BTS Too late
BTS As the man's hand approached his neck White Fang bristled and snarled and crouched down
BTS You won't fool me as you did in the lazarette
BTS Your teeth are pulled gentlemen
BTS Because it was unknown it was hostile to him
BTS Look at us
BTS He paused again
BTS You've got a right smart load as it is said one of them
BTS Utility is the better word
BTS White Fang experienced dual feelings
BTS And then in a flash the better solution came to me
BTS Kowalt
BTS We of the Revolution will go on with that great work but it will not be done by the miserable serfs
BTS I've a lover in Chicago she added apologetically
BTS I beat out the burning remnants of straw in the bunk then made a dash for the deck for fresh air
BTS The proletariat with its twenty millions engaged in occupations
BTS He had a vague feeling of impending doom
BTS With the coming of night in the mid-afternoon the cries sounded closer as the pursuers drew in according to their custom
BTS So sleepily helpless was I that she was compelled to hold me in my chair to prevent my being flung to the floor by the violent pitching of the schooner
BTS They hauled cabin logs and firewood freighted up to the mines and did all manner of work that horses did in the Santa Clara Valley
BTS Perhaps after all I was playing a cowardly part
BTS There were the master's two sisters Beth and Mary
BTS He shook his fist angrily at the gleaming eyes and began securely to prop his moccasins before the fire
BTS But White Fang could not believe
BTS In a category by itself is the deliberate burning and destruction of capitalist property by the capitalists themselves
BTS and this combined with the violent movement of the ship as she struggled through the storm would surely have made me sea-sick had I been a victim to that malady
BTS You have made no attempt to answer
BTS In another month we send fifty men to Congress
BTS Those who were executed went to their deaths with all the gladness of martyrs
BTS Do you think so
BTS The weakest and the more worthless were eaten first
BTS Nor could we learn anything about him except the reiterated statements that slight hopes were still held for his recovery
BTS was Leach's crafty answer strained from him in a smothered sort of way
BTS They were truly lords of society
BTS It's those damn headaches I believe
BTS We turned our heads swayed by a common impulse to see the last of the Ghost
BTS I was hurt
BTS Oh but you didn't she hurried on divining my answer
BTS It became his chief delight in life as it became White Fang's chief torment
BTS And bah
BTS I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand
BTS I stand convicted
BTS He was assailed terribly in the press in long and abusive editorials for his anarchy and hints were made of mental breakdown on his part
BTS He had too great vitality
BTS Maybe it's a Russian suggested Latimer
BTS Before he knew what he was doing he had slashed the intruder twice and sprung clear
BTS Without warning a shower of bombs fell from the top of the building
BTS My eyes fluttered and I could feel the blood warm in my face
BTS Maud looked entreaty at me
BTS Without them he could not run his empire
BTS For in that instant the she-wolf leaped sidewise from the trail into the clump of spruce trees and disappeared
BTS I know it is he said sadly
BTS Did you fall under temptation
BTS From far away drifted a faint sharp yelp followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps
BTS Let there be no rattling of blocks no sound of voices
BTS Go to them old fellow
BTS A man's got his rights
BTS Well you won't abide here long I can tell you
BTS White Fang took kindly to the work
BTS I had an instinct for proportion myself and I collapsed forthwith descending from the dominant pose of a master of matter to a state of humble confusion which was to say the least very miserable
BTS Outside the regular secret service of the Iron Heel there was further established a secret service of the Mercenaries this latter forming a connecting link between the police and the military
BTS I live in one of the loveliest localities of San Francisco
BTS White Fang growled and growled with insistent warning
BTS He pondered a long time before replying
BTS But you called me the American Mrs
BTS Again he nodded
BTS England was destined shortly to lose India while behind that event loomed the struggle between a united Asia and the world
BTS Hump he said slowly you can't do it
BTS Though he often tried to bark thereafter and the master encouraged him he succeeded only once and then it was not in the master's presence
BTS and let me begin by saying that you are all mistaken
BTS Irresistible impulses seized him
BTS Bishop Morehouse became excited
BTS Yet I cannot but believe for I have never yet caught him in a lie while he has a cyclopaedic knowledge of sealing and the men of the sealing fleets
BTS In the meantime the astonished team-dogs had burst out of their nests only to be set upon by the fierce invaders
BTS Also he forgot to be afraid
BTS Again he shook his head sadly
BTS My vision is clear and far
BTS She pecked on his nose which by now what of previous adventures was sore
BTS Capital does not consume the remaining two billions
BTS Only they are so expensive
BTS Some men are subject to it and others are not
BTS Thomas Mugridge lives in mortal fear of him and is afraid to venture on deck after dark
BTS The bankers and all the trusts for that matter had likewise long since loaned colossal amounts of money to the farmers
BTS And having surrendered the land the farmers next went to work for the farm trust becoming managers superintendents foremen and common laborers
BTS There was a sting in what he said
BTS I saw Maud my Maud straining and struggling and crushed in the embrace of Wolf Larsen's arms
BTS To add to my wretchedness a splitting headache was coming on and I was only too glad to close my eyes and try to sleep
BTS Still calmly though my heart was going pitapat I pulled out Louis's dirk and began to whet it on the stone
BTS Ye can't tell what'll be happenin' Louis went on in response to my query for more definite information
BTS and in that moment I hated him
BTS Calvin
BTS I drain the lees upon my knees For oh the draught is good
BTS Owen
BTS That it was mockery made the situation more puzzling to her
BTS While waiting for me he had engaged Maud in animated discussion
BTS It was on this adventure that he found the young weasel whose mother he had helped eat and he saw to it that the young weasel went the way of its mother
BTS He's bent upon giving them a lesson that's all
BTS I breathed
BTS In truth it was a joke to me that I the veriest landsman should be filling the office of mate
BTS And where is he
BTS The hand lifted and descended again in a patting caressing movement
BTS but he was too old in the world to forget his caution
BTS From pain and sheer exhaustion I wept in the darkness secretly so that Maud should not know
BTS He burst upon them in a fury
BTS That'll do
BTS He slipped down from his sitting posture till he lay on the deck
BTS A mile above the forks running velvet-footed as was his custom a gliding shadow that cautiously prospected each new vista of the trail he came upon later imprints of the large tracks he had discovered in the early morning
BTS If one man could be so monstrously treated and society move on its way unheeding might not many men be so monstrously treated
BTS His soul hasn't anything to do with it
BTS Maud Brewster accompanied me on deck but I left her at the break of the poop where she might watch the scene and not be in it
BTS I wanted to see him mastering men in discussion the war-note in his voice
BTS All worked well but there came a time when he fastened the pine-knot insecurely
BTS They had no inkling of such a patience
BTS The shears were gone altogether
BTS In addition to being exhibited he was a professional fighting animal
BTS he asked impatiently
BTS Wants all he can get
BTS Charity begins at home
BTS That's it isn't it
BTS Grey Beaver refused to sell the dog
BTS For profit--his life blood transmuted into a wine-supper or a jewelled gewgaw or some similar sense-orgy of the parasitic and idle rich his masters the arch-beasts
BTS I say what I think sir the sailor answered courageously not failing at the same time in ship courtesy which demanded that sir be appended to each speech he made
BTS I broke short off in the middle of a sentence
BTS The idea was infectious
BTS Philosophy is merely the widest science of all
BTS While on the question of vagaries I shall tell what befell Thomas Mugridge in the cabin and at the same time complete an incident upon which I have already touched once or twice
BTS To be sure it was an unwonted performance but he had learned to trust in men he knew and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own
BTS What of my new-found love I was a giant
BTS CHAPTER VI THE LOVE-MASTER As White Fang watched Weedon Scott approach he bristled and snarled to advertise that he would not submit to punishment
BTS He's comin' fast
BTS Rockefeller was moved almost to tears
BTS There was wailing in the village where the women and children went without in order that what little they had might go into the bellies of the lean and hollow-eyed hunters who trod the forest in the vain pursuit of meat
BTS Maud held the turn on the windlass and coiled down the slack
BTS We did sight one in the afternoon when the north-west breeze had sprung up freshly once more
BTS They were stiff and in pain
BTS Bound down a prisoner denied even movement by the plaster casts and bandages White Fang lingered out the weeks
BTS This woman was a new type to him a different breed from any he had ever known and he was curious
BTS Yet he knew that it was not permitted him to pursue and drag them down
BTS I found Wolf Larsen in the cabin stripped and bloody waiting for me
BTS But my happiness was not unalloyed
BTS He became another man
BTS You see the Chicago slaves are all killed
BTS he answered
BTS I was overjoyed
BTS I crept to the front of the store
BTS It was clear he did not wish to run too far away from them
BTS But I must give the events in their proper sequence
BTS She cried in general and she cried in particular over each discarded thing
BTS That is all
BTS His great chest was low to the ground his head forward and down while his feet were flying like mad the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in parallel grooves
BTS I had just finished tallying the skins of the last boat aboard when he came to my side in the darkness and said in a low tone Can you tell me Mr
BTS The boat was near enough for us to make out that it was larger than any sealing boat and built on different lines
BTS she cried
BTS the shoulders drooped with dejection and he uttered a deep sigh
BTS She seemed mastered by the verb to stitch
BTS Is it not then highly irrational to break the machine-loom and go back to the clumsy and more costly hand-loom method of weaving
BTS How do I know they are not afraid
BTS No I am not gathering material I assure you was my answer
BTS She was tired
BTS With my own hands I did it
BTS that is no answer to the charge that your own face is dirty
BTS I have seen and heard nothing believe me I said quietly
BTS A dense volume of smoke was pouring out of the steerage companion-way
BTS When I first awoke it was night
BTS He had merely intimated his displeasure in his pride believing that to intimate was to command
BTS The life in me to-day is just as curious as it was in my boyhood and it's the being curious that makes life worth living
BTS If you promise not to do it again she smiled
BTS I cried scrambling to my feet
BTS but ah me little I knew him or knew that even then perhaps he was meditating an outbreak more terrible than any I had seen
BTS I shall never forget the evening he brought home his street pedler's outfit of shoe-laces and suspenders nor the time I went into the little corner grocery to make some purchase and had him wait on me
BTS But his curiosity was rampant and several minutes later he was venturing forth on a new quest
BTS We knew it
BTS She took after him never ceasing her outcry
BTS But he is not always alone
BTS You lay the stress upon the desire apart from the soul Miss Brewster lays the stress on the soul apart from the desire and in point of fact soul and desire are the same thing
BTS quoth Thomas Mugridge and they clinked their glasses to the glorious game of Nap lighted cigars and fell to shuffling and dealing the cards
BTS As his teeth crunched through the tender flesh and fragile bones he began naturally to eat
BTS As for myself I was in a daze
BTS It was the very thing the Oligarchy had played for--the destruction of its great rival in the world-market
BTS She was timid and afraid but she possessed courage
BTS Then he gathered up the marmalade and underclothes and put them on the table
BTS No life stirred
BTS Three hours more were required to gasket the mainsail and jib and at two in the morning nearly dead the life almost buffeted and worked out of me I had barely sufficient consciousness to know the experiment was a success
BTS It ran up the tree and from a point of safety chattered back savagely
BTS Perrault knew dogs and when he looked at Buck he knew that he was one in a thousand One in ten t'ousand he commented mentally
BTS ' And it was a newspaper poem she said glibly
BTS Ernest came one afternoon with father
BTS but Ernest like the rest of his comrades was working for assurances from the labor leaders that they would call out their men in the next general strike
BTS The code of my group was stronger than I
BTS The jib itself was beginning to slap partially filling and emptying with sharp reports
BTS But you wrong me by withholding it I objected
BTS I must not lose one crawl or squirm if I am to get the most out of the ferment
BTS Not so was the conduct of Leach
BTS I near died of the scurvy and was rotten with it six months in Barbadoes
BTS Tonight he is going to begin putting to rights this very miserable world of ours
BTS My back was aching sorely and I felt extremely tired and hungry
BTS It's all a mess
BTS We did not have long to wait
BTS These men wanted dogs and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs with strong muscles by which to toil and furry coats to protect them from the frost
BTS Swallow a spoonful of sody an' you'll sweeten up wonderful an' be more pleasant company
BTS A dead silence greeted her appearance
BTS CHAPTER VIII Sometimes I think Wolf Larsen mad or half-mad at least what of his strange moods and vagaries
BTS I paused to listen for the breathing of the men but there was no breathing
BTS His mother heard it too
BTS Tim Keenan shoved the bull-dog forward with a muttered Go to it
BTS That gentlemen is socialism a greater combination than the trusts a greater economic and social combination than any that has as yet appeared on the planet
BTS We cannot fail
BTS Nevertheless one hundred and forty pounds to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion
BTS Not so with the men
BTS They had hurt only the flesh of him
BTS When it reared the master put the spurs to it and made it drop its fore-legs back to earth whereupon it would begin kicking with its hind-legs
BTS The jungle and the wilderness lurked in the uplift and downput of his feet
BTS I had strayed forward where the sailors were painting and I came to myself to find my advancing foot on the verge of overturning a paint-pot
BTS Like all the rest of humanity those two women are tied to the machine but they are so tied that they sit on top of it
BTS Yes what
BTS It was cleverly done
BTS What value
BTS An' wot 're you snifflin' about
BTS And he went about it in a way that reminded me of a story out of Boccaccio
BTS He came out of the tangle a spectacle of malignancy ears flattened back lips writhing nose wrinkling his teeth clipping together as the fangs barely missed the hound's soft throat
BTS It was at this time that vanished my last doubt of the completeness of my love for him a subconscious doubt at most
BTS In the nature of things and of intercourse with gods something terrible awaited him
BTS What he needs is some show of human kindness he added turning and going into the cabin
BTS And then step by step hand and foot he slowly struggled up the ladder
BTS Dolly the last husky added to the team at Dyea had a badly torn throat
BTS But as I was saying no one to-day is a free agent
BTS He was back in his rent and the oldest boy a lad of eleven had started to work in the mills
BTS I queried in a whisper
BTS I remember later in the voyage seeing Kerfoot another of the hunters lose a finger by having it smashed to a jelly
BTS And oh
BTS Another day of heart-breaking and dangerous toil saw us in camp with the two topmasts to the good
BTS He bellied cautiously inside and was met by a warning snarl from the she-wolf
BTS And none so poor not even Hump to do him reverence he sneered
BTS And had her eyes so spoken to me
BTS I was afraid to turn my shoulder to him and when I left the galley I went out backwards to the amusement of the sailors and hunters who made a point of gathering in groups to witness my exit
BTS She made some idle remark looking at me and laughed lightly enough
BTS A scarecrow I'm afraid I replied
BTS Growth was now routed by fear and he ki-yi'd like any frightened puppy
BTS This happened only last year and now she had been renamed
BTS This through many years of service and wear had acquired a long lean blade
BTS And because of all this he carried himself more boldly with a touch of defiance that was new in him
BTS Purpose  I began
BTS He lifted into the air described a short curve and struck the deck alongside the corpse on his head and shoulders where he lay and writhed about in agony
BTS so you see my dear your father's street-arab career is beset with disappointments
BTS He is going to deliver his message
BTS Your stomachs are round with the plenitude of eating
BTS Your stomach's sour that's what's botherin' you
BTS He who fairly burnt with immortality denied himself immortality--such was the paradox of him
BTS CHAPTER XX A LOST OLIGARCH But in remembering the old life I have run ahead of my story into the new life
BTS There one day closing a cab he encountered Mr
BTS Let me read an extract
BTS His face was pale and he seemed suffering from nausea
BTS Henry whistled long and comprehendingly
BTS One by one the wolves joined her till the whole pack on haunches with noses pointed skyward was howling its hunger cry
BTS Not a man believed him capable of the feat
BTS And in that moment so complete had been my transformation I discovered it was only by an effort of will that I could be the old Avis Everhard with the old mannerisms and smiles phrases and intonations of voice
BTS He's in with all the big bugs
BTS Look at 'im run
BTS Brutality had followed brutality and flaming passions and cold-blooded cruelty had driven men to seek one another's lives and to strive to hurt and maim and destroy
BTS All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this
BTS Into the Primitive Old longings nomadic leap Chafing at custom's chain
BTS She was ten but she was very strong
BTS May not the combination endure forever
BTS Telegraph Hill of course is your port of entry
BTS He had looked upon life in a more ferocious aspect
BTS They gave up their lives for humanity no sacrifice was too great for them to accomplish while inexorable necessity compelled them to bloody expression in an age of blood
BTS He had been ill-made in the making
BTS But you who read Spencer and Darwin and have never seen the inside of a school how did you learn to read and write
BTS He no longer lived in a hostile environment
BTS While Ernest slept I changed my dress arranged my hair differently and came back to my new automatic self
BTS She found the pin with an adorable little cry and I turned my attention more fully to my steering
BTS I noted Oofty-Oofty holding the end of a bandage and looking upon the scene his velvety and luminous eyes glistening in the light like a deer's eyes and yet I knew the barbaric devil that lurked in his breast and belied all the softness and tenderness almost womanly of his face and form
BTS Wolf Larsen was studying the clouding sky to windward
BTS I remember his conclusion his black eyes flashing as he said Gentlemen the South Sea Islander may do it the Malay may do it but take my word it's beyond the white man
BTS At two in the morning the boat's bow touched the beach of our own inner cove and I staggered out to make the painter fast
BTS Now don't scold don't you dare scold she cried with mock defiance
BTS That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater and as Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the Narwhal it was the last he saw of the warm Southland
BTS He would often seize Thornton's hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward
BTS Beyond its foaming base lay the pretty villages of the Japanese colonists and smiling valleys which penetrated deep into the interior
BTS The filth of his cooking was indescribable
BTS So we thought
BTS Ernest's manner changed on the instant
BTS One bully long res'
BTS The day had been dull and overcast but the sun now burst through the clouds a welcome omen and shone upon the curving beach where together we had dared the lords of the harem and slain the holluschickie
BTS It piled up in a heap a mound a huge and growing wave of dead and dying
BTS I should like to read it to you
BTS After the business that brought me there was transacted I was led away by one of them
BTS It was not till some time afterward that Ernest pointed out to me clearly that this general attitude of my class was something more than spontaneous that behind it were the hidden springs of an organized conduct
BTS but now their place was in my heart
BTS Wolf Larsen at the wheel directed the Ghost after the Macedonia's second weather boat
BTS And dreaming there by the Yukon bank with lazy eyes blinking at the fire these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his neck till he whimpered low and suppressedly or growled softly and the half-breed cook shouted at him Hey you Buck wake up
BTS She leaned heavily against me and I do believe that she had fallen asleep again between the arm-chair and the state-room
BTS In consequence the strange dogs he encountered had no chance against him
BTS And then that night it rained and she was flooded out and driven back into the boat
BTS All this and more I have learned
BTS Only the small capitalists competed and therefore they did the advertising
BTS Beauty Smith blinked in the lamplight and looked about him
BTS Pretty indeed to be caught there like a rat
BTS Buck's restlessness came back on him and he was haunted by recollections of the wild brother and of the smiling land beyond the divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches
BTS I didn't know what broughams were made for but now I know
BTS No sir I  But Wolf Larsen had turned away with a snort of disgust leaving the sailor rubbing his eyes with surprise at having been let of so easily
BTS The bloodhounds vainly quested on the lost trail
BTS and at the expense of several rows threats and much grumbling he brought the hunters to time
BTS Thus sticks and stones directed by these strange creatures leaped through the air like living things inflicting grievous hurts upon the dogs
BTS I have never seen body and spirit in such perfect accord
BTS One can feel the loom of them--things vast vague and terrible
BTS while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape detection
BTS But it won't continue she said with easy confidence
BTS The wolves were rushing him
BTS At this sweeping rebuke which the cook had only pointed the rest of the crew became uninterested and fell to work at one task or another
BTS Then you will undoubtedly understand the definition I shall now make of philosophy
BTS So befuddled and chaotic were their minds that the utterance of a single word could negative the generalizations of a lifetime of serious research and thought
BTS As for Cooky if he isn't lively bat him between the eyes
BTS He is a lump of an animal without any head
BTS 'Elp
BTS Pike who pulled at Buck's heels and who never put an ounce more of his weight against the breast-band than he was compelled to do was swiftly and repeatedly shaken for loafing
BTS One of his feet slipped and one man groaned aloud
BTS Hot words passed
BTS You needn't stray off too far in doin' it his partner admonished
BTS Bishop Morehouse turned appealingly to my father but he laughed and nodded his head
BTS Eyes and eyebrows lips mouths and ears were radically altered
BTS He is a free spirit surely I answered
BTS And it is so good that money
BTS Luck was with me and I gained access at once to comrade Galvin the surgeon-in-chief
BTS but while he was in shoulder had at last squarely met shoulder
BTS Pervaise was smuggled into one of the galleries ostensibly closed for repairs
BTS I thought of Maud asleep there in the hut we had reared
BTS You won't be a thousand years in finding out and in the meantime just pray for plenty of wind
BTS His eyes were yellow and muddy as though Nature had run short on pigments and squeezed together the dregs of all her tubes
BTS But I have read the personal narratives of a score of shipwrecked men who tried and tried in vain I answered
BTS And in his action I found complete refutation of all Wolf Larsen's materialism
BTS And house and lot had always been free and unencumbered
BTS and while I pulled the flying-jib and staysail split their cloths apart and thundered into nothingness
BTS I saw a head the hair wet and straight shape itself and then the unmistakable eyes and face of Wolf Larsen
BTS This was repeated the following year when the Morocco Affair threatened to involve France Germany and England
BTS A full stomach conduces to inaction and the cub lay in the cave sleeping against his mother's side
BTS Aw go lay down you make me tired Leach interfered
BTS But Bishop Morehouse oblivious to all his eyes filled with his vision continued Oh sisters and brothers in this act of mine I find the solution of all my difficulties
BTS You poor poor dears she cried sympathetically why don't you pull hard
BTS Besides Johansen was missing
BTS What shall I do
BTS The Oligarchy's public defence for the act was that it had done it for the sake of the American people whose interests it was looking out for
BTS Smoke's mates were now smiling broadly
BTS I seen some of them
BTS Wait and see Ernest said and I waited
BTS one's gone
BTS Not in three guesses father laughed
BTS He stopped abruptly and then on his lips formed one of his strange quizzical smiles as he added It's from my brain I envy you take notice and not from my heart
BTS As he struggled around the ring the fifty pounds of his foe ever dragging on his throat his anger passed on into panic
BTS and went down crying with fear into the embrace of the unknown
BTS But it is not alone
BTS The men at the saloon even urged the dogs on to attack White Fang
BTS The cell was of iron the floor the walls the roof
BTS He never ceased from his activities as a propagandist and was always scheduled long in advance for lectures to workingmen's organizations
BTS The famine was over
BTS The lordship of man was a need of his nature
BTS Liquor in large quantities was distributed among the slum classes further to inflame their minds
BTS But Lucifer was a free spirit
BTS He shrugged his shoulders
BTS He knew it as though it had taken place before his eyes
BTS White Fang followed sliding over the ground in wolf fashion and with wolf speed swiftly and without noise and in the centre of the field he dragged down and slew the dog
BTS Oh that it may not be premature
BTS He may sink the vessel or set fire to it
BTS But he had early discovered that one wall of his world was different from the rest
BTS In similar way many sons of the Russian nobility played their parts in the earlier and protracted revolution in that country
BTS I harm no one
BTS What freak of fortune had brought it here here of all spots
BTS Their standard of living fell
BTS In the intervals we could hear the soldiers talking and swearing as they rummaged among the carcasses urged on by their officers to hurry up
BTS What are you then
BTS Browning I lived with visions for my company Instead of men and women years ago And found them gentle mates nor thought to know A sweeter music than they played to me
BTS And so I have at last found my work in the world thanks to you young man
BTS Yet the food you have eaten or wasted might have saved the lives of a score of wretches who made the food but did not eat it
BTS The difference between you and the Eskimo who makes a fur-clad blubber-eating god is merely a difference of several thousand years of ascertained facts
BTS Gale followed gale with snow and sleet and rain
BTS A wild scream of fear and anguish hastened them
BTS His letters which had come to me regularly ceased
BTS He did not look at things with wide vision
BTS He might have let the small flint that he saw in the teeth go through
BTS She shook her head with a shudder
BTS And there were dogs everywhere that snarled at him and that he must not attack
BTS At last he fell toppling backward exhausted
BTS then he turned and with the speed of an express train headed down upon him
BTS Is he like you
BTS At other times I seriously contemplated suicide and the whole force of my hopeful philosophy was required to keep me from going over the side in the darkness of night
BTS His handshake was firm and strong but he looked at me boldly with his black eyes--too boldly I thought
BTS But Maud's hand leaped out restrainingly to mine
BTS Mr
BTS I have called your class stupid when outside the realm of business
BTS The increase in the younger generation of children who could not read nor write was perilous
BTS There are seals here he said
BTS White Fang knew nothing about fire
BTS I won't be mate on this hell-ship
BTS True he is not what you would term muscular but still he has muscles which is more than he had when he came aboard
BTS It was a hard day's run up the Canon through Sheep Camp past the Scales and the timber line across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep and over the great Chilcoot Divide which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely North
BTS Jock Horner and Smoke alone were unabashed stealing stealthy glances at her now and again and even taking part in the conversation
BTS The canvas flapped lazily
BTS I took out six fish
BTS Matt loosened the bandana from his own neck and started to put it around White Fang's
BTS His club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs and the grub-box was capsized on the ground
BTS Ernest saw in the affair the most sinister import
BTS They were howling at the very gates and sometimes he and the Factor paused from the game to listen and laugh at the futile efforts of the wolves to get in
BTS He sank his tiny teeth into one of the wings and pulled and tugged sturdily
BTS After a particularly fierce blow he crawled to his feet too dazed to rush
BTS What else did you run across
BTS Each and every thought-process of the scientific reasoner is metaphysical
BTS They crossed low divides and ranged a dozen small streams in a lower-lying country before their quest was rewarded
BTS It may not fan sufficiently to make the desire overmastering but in so far as it fans at all that far is it temptation
BTS And always he returned restless and uncomfortable to whimper softly and wistfully at Kiche's side and to lick her face with eager questioning tongue
BTS He crosses alone from the smiling timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees
BTS You are anarchists in the realm of thought
BTS He sat by John Thornton's fire a broad-breasted dog white-fanged and long-furred
BTS It's all right mother Scott was saying as he kept tight hold of White Fang and placated him
BTS And he was the food they were to eat
BTS His face was stern the lines of it had grown hard and yet in his eyes blue clear blue this day there was a strange brilliancy a bright scintillating light
BTS I don't know my own mind and that's what's the trouble
BTS His muscles became hard as iron and he grew callous to all ordinary pain
BTS There was no doubt about it
BTS We were not far off the line the wind made with the western edge of the promontory and I watched in the hope that some set of the current or send of the sea would drift us past before we reached the surf
BTS John Thornton was eating dinner when Buck dashed into camp and sprang upon him in a frenzy of affection overturning him scrambling upon him licking his face biting his hand playing the general tom-fool as John Thornton characterized it the while he shook Buck back and forth and cursed him lovingly
BTS Kill me
BTS CHAPTER XVII THE SCARLET LIVERY With the destruction of the Granger states the Grangers in Congress disappeared
BTS Ain't a bit scairt of you Henry laughed
BTS Suppose I should disagree with everybody about the literary style of a book
BTS I do believe that wolf's on to you the dog-musher said
BTS If ever a creature was the enemy of its kind White Fang was that creature
BTS Ah it's myself that knows ye for a blitherin' fool
BTS Thornton's voice rang out sharp in the tense silence
BTS I discovered that they had an ethic superior to that of the rest of society
BTS White Fang struggled and snarled but made no attempt to bite while he quickly quieted down at a sharp word from the master
BTS I commanded peremptorily
BTS The veranda seemed suddenly to have become small when Ernest arrived
BTS When the grey cub came back to life and again took interest in the far white wall he found that the population of his world had been reduced
BTS he commanded sweeping his arm out and over the chasm
BTS In vain he strove to drive them back
BTS And I could not swim a stroke
BTS Hoist in your boat he said to them
BTS Don't be a glutton Humphrey Maud chided me
BTS A Scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates and in company with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to Dawson
BTS and it dominates the call loan market on Wall Street and the stock market
BTS It was not until he became convinced of the hopelessness of his love affair that he acceded to our wishes and went back to his father
BTS Tell me has right anything to do with the law
BTS Scott grasped the dog-musher's hand
BTS Mebbe all mad dog sacredam
BTS Is it a go
BTS We're at the beginnin' iv things I'm tellin' ye the bare beginnin' iv things
BTS I had scarcely opened my mouth to issue the necessary commands when eager men were springing to halyards and downhauls and others were racing aloft
BTS Not alone was he in the geographical Southland for he was in the Southland of life
BTS To use his own phrase it worked it produced effects
BTS Maud had sunk down upon the deck and was I knew lying motionless her body in the shadow of the bulwark
BTS From this day we live in the cabin
BTS They have added to the gayety of mankind I grant
BTS Calvin joined in the laugh against himself
BTS But Maud had seen my first blow and she cried Don't
BTS Before the day was out White Fang was to learn more about this law
BTS But there was no sleep for me
BTS Not a soul escaped not even the guards
BTS But the comrades had no chance
BTS Out of it he had made a magnificent deer-park where over thousands of acres of sweet slopes and glades and canyons the deer ran almost in primitive wildness
BTS That'll do Yonson one of the men said
BTS Then the procession started on little spurts of strength coming into White Fang's muscles as he used them and the blood began to surge through them
BTS And I give you warning Wolf Larsen that I may forget love of my own life in the desire to kill you if you go too far in maltreating those poor wretches
BTS Our strength the strength of the proletariat is in our muscles in our hands to cast ballots in our fingers to pull triggers
BTS The Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers' Association and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club on the memorable night of Manuel's treachery
BTS ' But the man from Texas says 'You've got to put it in my hand
BTS He had learned well the law of club and fang and he never forewent an advantage or drew back from a foe he had started on the way to Death
BTS They went into farm mortgages
BTS It was not a good grip being too low down toward the chest
BTS Three days passed by which time Buck and his mates found how really tired and weak they were
BTS I shall probably scream
BTS Before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of Curly he received another shock
BTS His lips had become distorted into a permanent snarl which at mere sight of Wolf Larsen broke out in sound horrible and menacing and I do believe unconsciously
BTS The palaces of the Church should be hospitals and nurseries for those who have fallen by the wayside and are perishing
BTS He ran the gamut of denunciation rising to heights of wrath that were sublime and almost Godlike and from sheer exhaustion sinking to the vilest and most indecent abuse
BTS It was true that they sometimes gave meat but more often they gave hurt
BTS He forgot that in the covenant entered into between him and the gods they were pledged to care for him and defend him
BTS I'll be all right in a little while
BTS The slop-chest as well as the provisions was stored in the lazarette and I took advantage of the opportunity to lay in a stock of underclothing
BTS You do not agree with me
BTS There he remained eight months at the end of which time for two reasons he was loath to leave us
BTS And finally there was no danger to be incurred by the colossal frolic
BTS First name
BTS He looked along the airy path he must traverse and then down to the deck
BTS I have said that it was discovered only once and this brings me to the clearing up of the mystery of the disappearance of young Wickson
BTS Concerning his own rages I am convinced that they are not real that they are sometimes experiments but that in the main they are the habits of a pose or attitude he has seen fit to take toward his fellow-men
BTS There on the beach not fifty feet away bow on dismasted was a black-hulled vessel
BTS Nor I until I knew you I answered
BTS Mugridge went down on the fore-hatch under three men
BTS The whole long day was a blaze of sunshine
BTS Wolf Larsen strode aft from amidships where he had been talking with the rescued men
BTS But before I make it I shall challenge you to point out error in it or to remain a silent metaphysician
BTS As they were descending they swept across a railroad directly over a troop-train that was heading at full speed for Chicago
BTS their capacity to change the very face of the world
BTS Then I recollected Maud
BTS Though stoutly mittened my fingers were cold and they pained from the grip on the steering-oar
BTS They are more like children to him even the hunters and as children he treats them descending perforce to their level and playing with them as a man plays with puppies
BTS That man's name is Jackson Ernest said
BTS and the fifth turn about was taking a hand in the defence of its nearest mate
BTS Jackson had been working many hours and his muscles had lost their resiliency and snap
BTS I'd liked to have done for you first Hump
BTS She had snarled as she sprang away baring her white fangs to their roots all her wistfulness vanishing being replaced by a carnivorous malignity that made him shudder
BTS but that Wolf Larsen stormed the last strongholds of my faith with a vigour that received respect while not accorded conviction
BTS Remember I said you see but one side of the shield
BTS It would appear that they are a half-brute half-human species a race apart wherein there is no such thing as sex
BTS And I have made a discovery
BTS Then I turned my face against Ernest's breast and wept softly for the Cause that was lost
BTS His own face was passion-wrought
BTS As his eyes closed it fell away from his hand
BTS There was nothing in them and yet there was much in them for those skilled in reading between the lines that it was intended the ordinary reader should read into the text
BTS It is their inborn heritage to strive to devour and to strive not to be devoured
BTS Yes I've been watching it was Wolf Larsen's calm reply
BTS Nor did Timothy Donnelly long survive
BTS I was not surprised when I had my talk out with Mrs
BTS The roar of it no longer dinned upon his ears
BTS I remembered hazily the physics of my school days while the last few months had given me practical experience with mechanical purchases
BTS They were meat and it was hungry
BTS I could kill the man who robbed me he interrupted
BTS Love of the right desire for the right unhappiness with anything less than the right--in short right conduct is the prime factor of religion
BTS His whole concern was with the immediate objective present
BTS It was twelve o'clock
BTS He never knew defeat
BTS What do you make of those things
BTS and again he ran at the head of the team the gut-whips of Mit-sah and Grey Beaver snapping behind their voices crying Ra
BTS Beauty Smith's eyes lighted up at this and he licked his thin lips with an eager tongue
BTS and it remained for us on the outside to do it
BTS In this way may you look at him through my eyes and learn him as I learned him--in all save the things too secret and sweet for me to tell
BTS My pulse rushed up in an unwonted manner yet my rage mounted with it
BTS When he broke through into the ring Beauty Smith was just in the act of delivering another kick
BTS The Second Revolt was largely the work of Ernest Everhard though he cooperated of course with the European leaders
BTS There's where I ran across altruism' and I remember now how it was used
BTS He nodded his head
BTS when the face of his spirit had become iron and all his instincts and axioms had crystallised into set rules cautions dislikes and desires
BTS that could grow chill as an arctic landscape and yet again that could warm and soften and be all a-dance with love-lights intense and masculine luring and compelling which at the same time fascinate and dominate women till they surrender in a gladness of joy and of relief and sacrifice
BTS There was no way for anybody to tell him about all these people and of blood-ties and relationship he knew nothing whatever and never would be capable of knowing
BTS I had to dig it out for myself
BTS People were struggling and floundering in the water about me
BTS Worse than that he did not seem to be aware of them
BTS It was the Wild in him the fear of hurt and of the trap that had given rise to the panicky impulses to avoid contacts
BTS though the gigantic caldron continued to bubble in the distance dull roars of explosions came to us from all directions and the smoke-pillars were towering more ominously in the heavens
BTS Both men had lost hope Johnson because of temperamental despondency
BTS We had scarcely filled away it seemed when the fog thinned abruptly and we were again in the sunshine the wide-stretching sea breaking before us to the sky-line
BTS Turning a corner we came upon a woman
BTS In the Wild the time of a mother with her young is short
BTS On the other hand there were the fox terriers a score of them at least who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops
BTS Only occasionally on the sidewalks were there stray pedestrians and these pedestrians did not loiter
BTS He had no conscious knowledge of death but like every animal of the Wild he possessed the instinct of death
BTS It made him frantic
BTS But there are the holluschickie she said
BTS But there are his arms his hands his terrible terrible hands
BTS It's attacking my nerve-centres eating them up bit by bit cell by cell from the pain
BTS There is a saying that truth will out
BTS The wolves were gone
BTS The United States was paralyzed
BTS One must become so adept as to deceive oneself
BTS You were once and able to eat me as you were pleased to phrase it
BTS Oh Cooky
BTS Now to begin again
BTS There were seals all about us in the water and the bellowing thousands on the beach compelled us to shout at each other to make ourselves heard
BTS and I saw almost above me and emerging from the fog the bow of a vessel and three triangular sails each shrewdly lapping the other and filled with wind
BTS The jaw dropped the upper lip lifted and two rows of tobacco-discoloured teeth appeared
BTS They were fighters that was certain
BTS A million and a half of the men of the working class say that they are going to get the rest of the working class to join with them and take the management away from you
BTS Calvin here launched out into a political speech in exposition of his views
BTS And I felt as proud of my conception as if it were already a fact accomplished
BTS he exclaimed impatiently
BTS He was beaten he knew that
BTS He grinned when I handed it over yet it was a grin that contained more sincere thanks than a multitude of the verbosities of speech common to the members of my own class
BTS Mugridge's face turned white under its sooty veneer and when Wolf Larsen called for a rope and a couple of men the miserable Cockney fled wildly out of the galley and dodged and ducked about the deck with the grinning crew in pursuit
BTS Thornton shook him back and forth
BTS Young man he trumpeted that statement is on a par with all you have uttered to-night
BTS Old tub
BTS And as this idea of fulfilling Wolf Larsen's order persisted in my dazed consciousness I seemed to see him standing at the wheel in the midst of the wild welter pitting his will against the will of the storm and defying it
BTS His hind-legs still rested on the cave-lip so he fell forward head downward
BTS I couldn't afford to let the hunter have it and there is a chance the boat-puller doesn't know how to steer
BTS And right here Baseek erred
BTS We showed it our power in the general strike
BTS Not only was he released from prison in reward for his deed but he was granted an income for life
BTS These old bones of mine are fragile and I've learned my lesson
BTS Poor blundering thief that he was always getting caught and punished he had none the less been a faithful worker
BTS The crackling turned into a snapping the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and grating several inches to the side
BTS Weedon nodded his head
BTS If I promise not to lay my hands upon Leach will you promise in turn not to attempt to kill me
BTS The Ghost suddenly changed her course keeping away and it came to me with a shock that Wolf Larsen was giving up the rescue as impossible
BTS Verbal contradictions called BULLS were long an amiable weakness of the ancient Irish
BTS Or perhaps who can tell
BTS She was strong
BTS We are not prepared to brave the sea
BTS And repeatedly Ernest warned father to cease fighting and to take to cover
BTS And still we rocked gently and there was no wind
BTS No more Spitz no more trouble sure
BTS Kelly subsided with some muttering and the Kanaka flashed his white teeth in a grateful smile
BTS Perhaps it was to this that the golden colour was due
BTS I have now given you the rest of the alphabet
BTS But the path began nowhere and ended nowhere and it remained mystery as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery
BTS He too gave me the impression that he was not a free agent as we talked I began to see that he was mentally superior to the average of his kind
BTS Famine came again and the cub with clearer consciousness knew once more the bite of hunger
BTS I had slept twenty-one hours
BTS ' You are a sort of monster I added audaciously a Caliban who has pondered Setebos and who acts as you act in idle moments by whim and fancy
BTS An' dat Buck fight lak two hells was Francois's answer
BTS Round and round the decks they went Mugridge sick with fear the sailors hallooing and shouting directions to one another and the hunters bellowing encouragement and laughter
BTS Wickson exercised tremendous social power in the university town and from them emanated the sentiment that I was a too-forward and self-assertive young woman with a mischievous penchant for officiousness and interference in other persons' affairs
BTS But in that age insurance was a very serious matter
BTS And it was exertion
BTS Year by year it has been increased until to-day it is three hundred thousand
BTS Once more Francois called and once more Buck laughed and kept away
BTS and no classification of the three greatest lawyers in the United States could have excluded him
BTS The life that was so swiftly expanding within him urged him continually toward the wall of light
BTS Look at the states we've captured
BTS Certainly among my many new trades I shone least as a sail-maker
BTS To-day we know better but our knowledge does not overcome the fact that Ghent remains the most abused innocent man in all history
BTS The newspapers in 1902 of that era credited the president of the Anthracite Coal Trust George F
BTS As a preliminary to another journey to his bunk he hooked Wolf Larsen's buttonhole with a greasy forefinger and vacuously proclaimed and reiterated I got money I got money I tell yer an' I'm a gentleman's son
BTS The old girl knows how to walk
BTS everything favoured a big catch
BTS Yonson he began
BTS He travelled very clumsily
BTS He is mad this morning
BTS With the exception of the huge bulks of the skin-lodges little could be seen save the flames of the fire broken by the movements of intervening bodies and the smoke rising slowly on the quiet air
BTS You mean-- I began
BTS Their hope lies in keeping a weather position so that they may run before the wind for the schooner when it breezes up
BTS D'ye want to look at 'em
BTS Here are you a century and a half later trying to break machines
BTS and so it was that I schooled myself to understand his work
BTS You said yourself that he'd done right
BTS Consider yourself on salary during the time you remain with us
BTS What vessel was it
BTS In the main and ignoring the loss of liberty they were better off than they had been
BTS This was the cry from the Lady Mine
BTS Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank where Judge Miller's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon
BTS Three yards away from Johnson he was and sitting down
BTS He experienced two great impulsions to yield and to fight
BTS Kowalt
BTS A few Grangers who had been elected to Congress increased our strength and an elaborate programme of what was to be done was prepared by the united forces
BTS Owen affirmed with a complacent smile
BTS and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went down into the land of timber and streams
BTS The hollows under fallen trees seemed to attract her and she spent much time nosing about among the larger snow-piled crevices in the rocks and in the caves of overhanging banks
BTS It was worth more in some strange way then a dozen pieces of meat from the hand of a squaw
BTS She dropped in alongside by him as though it were her appointed position and took the pace of the pack
BTS Never in that period did any of them crawl toward the dark corners of the back-wall
BTS He was mad for life
BTS Not to be considered he laughed
BTS I'm sure I've heard it before somewhere in books she murmured gleefully
BTS The thumb of circumstance had done its work only too well
BTS She turned and trotted back into the forest to the great relief of One Eye who trotted a little to the fore until they were well within the shelter of the trees
BTS It's no use he said
BTS I hope to fill every room in my palace with such sisters as they
BTS He was doing it now vociferating bellowing waving his arms and cursing like a fiend and all because of a disagreement with another hunter as to whether a seal pup knew instinctively how to swim
BTS I had not thought you so great a coward I sneered
BTS In less than an hour I had the maintopmast on deck and was constructing the shears
BTS He had not rushed forward after the manner of other dogs
BTS And camp they did till Buck's ribs knitted and he was able to travel
BTS you are
BTS But were they sleeping
BTS Master and owner of a ship at the top of my life as you say when I am beginning to diminish and die
BTS This will mean deterioration of the labor castes and in the end they will become weaker and weaker
BTS With the exception of the prison pallor there was no change in him--at least not much
BTS I obeyed and the two brutes picked up the senseless man like a sack of rubbish and hove him clear up the companion stairs through the narrow doorway and out on deck
BTS It has been the law for years for nine years gentlemen
BTS When dogs fight there are usually preliminaries to the actual combat snarlings and bristlings and stiff-legged struttings
BTS Simon Doctor of Divinity and professor in the Randolph-Macon Methodist College of Virginia wrote Extracts from Holy Writ unequivocally assert the right of property in slaves together with the usual incidents to that right
BTS His eyes were half closed and the surface of them was glassy
BTS The three-year-old grew too ambitious in his fierceness
BTS He could not go beyond it
BTS I'll deny every word of it
BTS As a class they disciplined themselves
BTS Do nothing or you will be destroyed
BTS He had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought and his first experience taught him an unforgetable lesson
BTS Against the wall near the head of the bunk was a rack filled with books
BTS Candidate for Governor of California on the Socialist ticket in the fall election of 1906 Christian Era
BTS Mebbe he won't do for us but mark my words hell 'll be an ice-box to this ship from now on
BTS Just at the moment I came out of the butcher-shop a man emerged from the corner grocery that stood alongside
BTS At Grey Beaver's heels he limped obediently through the village to the tepee
BTS There was purpose in his method something for him to do that he was intent upon doing and from which nothing could distract him
BTS Fore and aft there was nothing that could have surprised us more than his consequent behaviour
BTS In this manner it came about that he fought all sizes and breeds of dogs
BTS The good
BTS The morning of the fourth day found the wind diminished to a gentle whisper the sea dying down and the sun shining upon us
BTS And between these two desires is just where the soul of the man is manifest she went on
BTS He lay down in the snow depositing the ptarmigan beside him and with eyes peering through the needles of a low-growing spruce he watched the play of life before him the waiting lynx and the waiting porcupine each intent on life
BTS To be was all that remained to him to be as he had defined death without movement
BTS Fresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs were to take the places of those worthless for the trail
BTS This the younger man endeavoured to accomplish by clutching the bulldog's jaws in his hands and trying to spread them

BTS Does capital consume all of its two billions
BTS And Ernest was not pleasant to look at
BTS The crisis in my own fortunes came simultaneously with great crises in society
BTS W
BTS How can the Old World heroes compare with ours
BTS Then you must promise something else I ventured
BTS Matt did that it was his business
BTS I was aware of a faintly perceptible shrinking on the part of the listeners before this figure of revolution concrete potential and menacing
BTS But making an extra trip to the galley a little later I was gladdened by the sight of Harrison staggering weakly from the rigging to the forecastle scuttle
BTS They hoisted the white flag of surrender but it was ignored
BTS But how comes it that you are here
BTS Now there you go too far
BTS Now Anna Roylston was a fascinating woman
BTS He cried and cried interminably and every fresh wail was greeted by bursts of laughter on the part of the man-animals
BTS My biceps was being crushed to a pulp
BTS The ball of quills might have been a stone for all it moved
BTS The pool itself muddy and discolored from the sluice boxes effectually hid what it contained and it contained John Thornton
BTS Some dam day heem keel dat Buck
BTS When the master appeared all other beings ceased to exist so far as White Fang was concerned
BTS Oh I assure you I know the frightful persecution they can wage on a professor who is economically dependent on his university
BTS After a time the ptarmigan ceased her struggling
BTS He worked faithfully in the harness for the toil had become a delight to him
BTS But Buck did not read the newspapers and he did not know that Manuel one of the gardener's helpers was an undesirable acquaintance
BTS You are right young man
BTS Also I rent two rooms in workingmen's houses in different quarters of the city
BTS He was certainly a handsome man beautiful in the masculine sense
BTS Clerks in the express office took charge of him
BTS By it White Fang knew whether he did right or not
BTS We have put mammon in the place of Christ
BTS She rendered it beautifully but I watched not her but Wolf Larsen
BTS 'Ere 'e is sir the cook said
BTS But I was soon to know
BTS The old have no chance
BTS Mary McKenna lives south of Market Street
BTS Just now the possession of this money is a pleasurable thing
BTS It was a long ripping slash and deep as well
BTS I worked my way through doing janitor-work
BTS There are far more unions outside of this combination than in it
BTS she cried pausing from sheer weakness
BTS You stand on dead men's legs
BTS in September he was stricken with rheumatism of the heart and lived for three days
BTS It is a great extravagance I know but it is necessary
BTS What is your way out
BTS Automatically his eyes were adjusting themselves to the brightness focusing themselves to meet the increased distance of objects
BTS And there's not much reason against his bein' a sled-dog again
BTS We must club the seals I announced when convinced of my poor marksmanship
BTS But it was very unreal at the time
BTS but since imprisonment proved no bar to our activities it was decided to avoid anything premature
BTS Bosh and nonsense
BTS I have lived it day and night utterly and for so long that it is ever present in my mind
BTS Matt rushed in but quicker than he was White Fang
BTS Nor did he speak till he had taken his seat on the coffin and begun to eat
BTS Still it was not over the hole
BTS At eight o'clock I had succeeded only in putting the second reef into the foresail
BTS We've paid for our experience in sweat and blood and we've earned all that's coming to us was the reply
BTS So greatly had he suffered and so far gone was he that the blows did not hurt much
BTS Men should be men not brutes
BTS Yer not 'arf bad 'Ump
BTS I wish I could convey to you the conception that is dimly forming in my own mind Ernest said
BTS It was plain that I could look for no help or mercy from Wolf Larsen
BTS Familiar in varying degree with the sea they took me as a sort of joke
BTS Judge Scott pooh-poohed and laughed but not with reason for it was in his last days on the bench that Jim Hall had stood before him and received sentence
BTS George Leach sir came the sullen answer and the boy's bearing showed clearly that he divined the reason for which he had been summoned
BTS He did it with great ostentation glancing significantly at me the while
BTS Strange to say the unfortunate Johnson came into my mind as we lifted and surged and heeled along and I was aware of a regret that he was not alive and present
BTS All the gods started up the steps to enter the house
BTS It was to the rear somewhere in the snow expanse they had just traversed
BTS Colossal profits
BTS Don't I know
BTS The fun was over until the next steamer should arrive
BTS God made you well I said
BTS Insidiously and by remote ways as well as by the power of stick and stone and clout of hand were the shackles of White Fang's bondage being riveted upon him
BTS White Fang no longer hesitated
BTS It seems that he has been seal-hunting regularly each season for a dozen years and is accounted one of the two or three very best boat-steerers in both fleets
BTS Confusion thrice confounded
BTS Neither do they
BTS CHAPTER XIV It has dawned upon me that I have never placed a proper valuation upon womankind
BTS He talked ambiguously and was so apprehensive of what I might say that I had not the heart to catechise him
BTS Back up the canyon from the lip of the hole all marks were likewise removed
BTS He accompanied her joyfully about the camp
BTS The loneliness of the man is slowly being borne in upon me
BTS To accomplish the change was like a reflux of being and this when the plasticity of youth was no longer his
BTS Their mother looked apprehensively in their direction
BTS he questioned
BTS Very gently and somewhat suspiciously he first smelled the tallow and then proceeded to eat it
BTS I waited watching two men who stood by the wheel one of them steering
BTS In the meantime he accepted all the punishment the other could deal him
BTS It was distasteful to his instinct
BTS Grey Beaver was in the debt of Three Eagles
BTS They got out of his way when he came along
BTS Once as though a warning had in vague ways flitted through his intelligence he turned his head and looked back at the overturned sled at his team-mates and at the two men who were calling to him
BTS and more than a few there were who had never returned from the quest
BTS Wolf Larsen evidently had sifted the great philosopher's teachings rejecting and selecting according to his needs and desires
BTS Hearst made a gallant fight
BTS he cried
BTS He had grown rich with his trading and stood in need of nothing
BTS The sturdy skeleton of it remained
BTS Both he and Johnson would have killed Wolf Larsen at the slightest opportunity but the opportunity never came
BTS The she-wolf was one leap behind One Ear and holding her own
BTS and those clothes
BTS Only the inner chiefs could have known up to to-day
BTS And another I know what I'll say that I heered a row jumped out of my bunk got a jolly good crack on the jaw for my pains and sailed in myself
BTS Before him sitting silently on their haunches were five live things the like of which he had never seen before
BTS There were no wagons rumbling on the streets no factory whistles no hum of electricity in the air no passing of street cars no cries of news-boys--nothing but persons who at rare intervals went by like furtive ghosts themselves oppressed and made unreal by the silence
BTS A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river
BTS For a time each blow brought a yelp from him
BTS And now he said let me tell you about that revolution
BTS Grey Beaver saw him and stopped munching the tallow
BTS The display on both sides the quickness of the one and the steadiness of the other had excited the partisan spirit of the crowd and the men were making new bets and increasing original bets
BTS Laughter had affected him with madness made him frantic with rage
BTS Our experience warranted this state of mind and we went about our work with anxiety always upon us
BTS Indeed she trod the earth lightly and in her constitution there was little of the robust clay
BTS At the conclusion of one such panic when he and Henry had got the dogs back in the traces Bill said I wisht they'd strike game somewheres an' go away an' leave us alone
BTS Head right into the bunch Mr
BTS but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry and he came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek
BTS He must have divined Wolf Larsen's trick and the sureness of detection for the light was at once dashed from my hand and the forecastle was left in darkness
BTS But such fights were of brief duration
BTS Wolf Larsen thundered
BTS She recognized a flight that midmost broke
BTS The very last of all I saw
BTS We're only a couple of blocks now from where I got you out of that entrance
BTS They don't know the meanin' of it
BTS For the first time in my life I experienced the desire to murder saw red as some of our picturesque writers phrase it
BTS Who feeds you
BTS Besides no matter how small the good nevertheless his little inadequate wail will be productive of some good in the revolution and every little bit counts
BTS I served as assistant while he probed and cleansed the passages made by the bullets and I saw the two men endure his crude surgery without anaesthetics and with no more to uphold them than a stiff tumbler of whisky
BTS If Jackson and all his fellows were treated mercifully the dividends would not be so large
BTS For when the weather was fair and we were in the midst of the herd all hands were away in the boats and left on board were only he and I and Thomas Mugridge who did not count
BTS Having grown tired apparently of the task she relinquished the oar to me
BTS It was not until the coming of the Brotherhood of Man that the leg-bar passed out of use
BTS He was obeying the will of the gods
BTS This was the danger point the stretching of the conspiracy
BTS They are so tied by their human nature that they can't do a thing unless they think it is right
BTS He had not learned to be dependent on his kind for companionship
BTS The domesticated generations fell from him
BTS He was made into a broken-down beast by his masters the arch-beasts
BTS But just then the wrist I held leaped from my hand and the hand clasped like a steel trap about my wrist
BTS Yes sir he answered with cheerful alacrity
BTS Besides it was a position of such utter helplessness that White Fang's whole nature revolted against it
BTS Ah I cannot get you to understand cannot drive it into your head what a thing this life is
BTS He owed no allegiance to this strange and terrible god
BTS Never had he had such an appetite at our table in the old days
BTS I stopped obediently in my walk toward the galley
BTS Yet he quickly worked it out that all of them belonged to the master
BTS Also there was a lust in him akin to madness which had come with sight of the blood he had drawn
BTS The swift changes in our industrial system are causing equally swift changes in our religious political and social structures
BTS The cub felt his mother wilting at the sound
BTS It is said that the chief of this staff has a salary of 125000 a year
BTS Three of the Reds lost their lives in vain efforts to get him
BTS He was too philosophic and simple to be vindictive and he lived too much in the world of mind to miss the creature comforts we were giving up
BTS This chitter-chatter drove me to distraction
BTS Stronger than the physical restraint of the stick was the clutch of the camp upon her
BTS He turned it over with his paw
BTS Morning broke dull and grey but calm and I was awake early and had the boat in readiness
BTS and in those fields they served the important function of moulding the thought-processes of the nation in the direction of the perpetuity of the Oligarchy
BTS Class hatred is neither in the text nor in the spirit of anything I have ever written
BTS Habeas corpus I heard some one mutter just now
BTS Such a war would virtually put the Oligarchy in possession of the world-market
BTS Oh please please Humphrey don't
BTS He symbolised it was its personification so that when they showed their teeth to him they were defending themselves against the powers of destruction that lurked in the shadows of the forest and in the dark beyond the camp-fire
BTS A curious anecdote has come down to us of John Burns a great English labor leader and one time member of the British Cabinet
BTS It was almost dizzying in its effect
BTS Do you know Dr
BTS He lived there three years
BTS I I confess I hardly do understand she hesitated a perturbed but not frightened expression in her eyes
BTS But there were other forces at work in the cub the greatest of which was growth
BTS My heart
BTS The wolves behind collided with the young wolf and expressed their displeasure by administering sharp nips on his hind-legs and flanks
BTS Fortune seemed to favour him
BTS Hartman bent over and examined her
BTS He attacked them when he caught them alone and they attacked him when they were bunched
BTS No matter what they want to do the sanction always comes
BTS Stand by to let that jib over you Oofty
BTS But there can be no danger now
BTS and morning noon and night and all night as well he devoted himself to making life unlivable for them
BTS How do you know
BTS Had it not done this I know that I should have died
BTS Then I'll break his neck Scott retorted continuing his shoving and wedging with the revolver muzzle
BTS He was a mad god at best but White Fang knew nothing of madness
BTS You would go into the militia yourself was Ernest's retort and be sent to Maine or Florida or the Philippines or anywhere else to drown in blood your own comrades civil-warring for their liberties
BTS Membership in the labor castes will become hereditary
BTS The unknown bore him on he knew not to what frightful hurt and he yelped and ki-yi'd unceasingly
BTS She rarely slept any more in the cave spending most of her time on the meat-trail and spending it vainly
BTS Dub was badly injured in a hind leg
BTS CHAPTER II THE BONDAGE The days were thronged with experience for White Fang
BTS Again the fiat of the Plutocracy went forth and the small business men and manufacturers swamped him with a flood of notices that he must discontinue running their old advertisements
BTS But I took no notice
BTS Then when the storm broke Wolf Larsen cruised back and forth over that portion of the ocean where we had encountered it and somewhat more to the westward while the boats were being repaired and new sails made and bent
BTS Books and brains and bravery
BTS Your education is only half completed then he said dryly and turned to her
BTS I disconnected it he said and just in the nick of time
BTS Yet it was if anything worse than ever
BTS Only the regularly organized militia was out and it was out everywhere
BTS He forgot that she had made life a burden to him and when she disported herself around him he responded solemnly striving to be playful and becoming no more than ridiculous
BTS They were forced swept on by this inrolling tide of wealth which their monopoly magnet irresistibly attracted
BTS I failed to mark anything pre-eminently pretty about those foamy-mouthed beasts that raced me
BTS And leap by leap like some pale frost wraith the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead
BTS and 5 Moore Reid and Leeds known as the Rock Island crowd
BTS They knew not what end would come but they never anticipated a more disastrous end than the one that did come
BTS Both men were wounded and he was thrashing them both for having disobeyed his orders and crippled themselves in advance of the hunting season
BTS There were butcher-shops where meat hung within reach
BTS To this Cherokee responded by vigorous wagging of the stump of his tail
BTS I beg your pardon I said or shouted rather in order to make myself heard above the roar of the rookery
BTS For an hour I steered each moment becoming more difficult
BTS It was lean with long-standing hunger
BTS Come on Matt lend a hand the newcomer called the dog-musher who had followed him into the ring
BTS Ahem we'll discuss that later he smiled as a bullet struck solidly into the cabin wall
BTS White Fang began by ignoring him
BTS He devoted all the years of his manhood to it and for it he gave his life
BTS From Cuba to California out of scores of jails military prisons and fortresses in a single night we delivered fifty-one of our fifty-two Congressmen and in addition over three hundred other leaders
BTS This was no soil for kindliness and affection to blossom in
BTS For an immeasurable period lapped in the rippling of placid centuries I enjoyed and pondered my tremendous flight
BTS Might
BTS Wot you say Perrault
BTS All she had to do was to beckon a man to her
BTS Understand
BTS I had glanced occasionally at the approaching schooner and it was now almost abreast of us and not more than a couple of hundred yards away
BTS Johnson's ascent was arrested
BTS Meat is scarce answered his comrade
BTS It sounded like the gurgling of a brook over mossy stones in some quiet dell and the crooning song of it lured me away and out of myself till I was no longer Hump the cabin-boy nor Van Weyden the man who had dreamed away thirty-five years among books
BTS He compelled them to an unremitting respect for him
BTS I came in violent collision with a large woman in front of me the man with the split coat had vanished while those behind collided against me
BTS but many a young dog went around camp with a lacerated throat in token of White Fang's intention
BTS Garthwaite put his mouth to my ear and shouted but in the frightful din I could not catch what he said
BTS Maud's condition was pitiable
BTS I wish I had thought to bring Wolf Larsen's chronometer and sextant I said still gloomily
BTS After that grateful and content White Fang lay at Grey Beaver's feet gazing at the fire that warmed him blinking and dozing secure in the knowledge that the morrow would find him not wandering forlorn through bleak forest-stretches but in the camp of the man-animals with the gods to whom he had given himself and upon whom he was now dependent
BTS Astronomy and physics were represented and I remarked Bulfinch's Age of Fable Shaw's History of English and American Literature and Johnson's Natural History in two large volumes
BTS The hound under the command Dick
BTS By the way Mr
BTS So dazed was I for the moment that I was scarcely aware of the fact that we were being held up by the police
BTS for as it is with the hunters so it is with the boat-pullers and steerers in the place of wages they receive a lay a rate of so much per skin for every skin captured in their particular boat
BTS he exclaimed and left the table at once to go on deck and into the steerage where the hunters were taking the first breakfast of their exile
BTS Unlike man whose gods are of the unseen and the overguessed vapours and mists of fancy eluding the garmenture of reality wandering wraiths of desired goodness and power intangible out-croppings of self into the realm of spirit unlike man the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to the fire find their gods in the living flesh solid to the touch occupying earth-space and requiring time for the accomplishment of their ends and their existence
BTS I cannot lay too great stress upon this high ethical righteousness of the whole oligarch class
BTS The defection of the great unions had prevented our proletarian revolt but violence was everywhere
BTS The pound and a half of sun-dried salmon which was his ration for each day seemed to go nowhere
BTS CHAPTER XXI The chagrin Wolf Larsen felt from being ignored by Maud Brewster and me in the conversation at table had to express itself in some fashion and it fell to Thomas Mugridge to be the victim
BTS But White Fang was to have no more than a nightmare vision of the city an experience that was like a bad dream unreal and terrible that haunted him for long after in his dreams
BTS It was their way
BTS By now I had developed such skill at surgery that Wolf Larsen with a few words of advice left me to my task with a couple of sailors for assistants
BTS What if his lying down were a ruse
BTS He had no false sense of values
BTS This was dead in our teeth but I took in the sea-anchor and set sail hauling a course on the wind which took us in a south-south-easterly direction
BTS But what were you doing while all this was going on
BTS and also I thought We were so happy and peaceful before he came
BTS but this is certainly what Wolf Larsen is doing
BTS and such was the curiousness of the game the way of life for one lay in the eating of the other and the way of life for the other lay in being not eaten
BTS Sometimes as he crouched there blinking dreamily at the flames it seemed that the flames were of another fire and that as he crouched by this other fire he saw another and different man from the half-breed cook before him
BTS Here a yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the ground with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun
BTS That's the keynote
BTS He was plainly perplexed and he came back again pausing a dozen feet away and regarding the two men intently
BTS He was quick to obey and I found myself alone on the deck of the Ghost
BTS We camp right here
BTS and wages were being cut right and left
BTS Leave it where it is
BTS My right cheek has been numb all day
BTS When there is only so much of the same thing and when two men want all they can get of the same thing there is a conflict of interest between labor and capital
BTS Never mind Tommy I said placing a soothing hand on his shoulder
BTS He was a magnificent atavism a man so purely primitive that he was of the type that came into the world before the development of the moral nature
BTS CHAPTER XXXIII We waited all day for Wolf Larsen to come ashore
BTS And if anything should happen to you think of me left here alone
BTS But was such calculated drift correct
BTS Then on one side and the other she ran along the base of the wall to where its abrupt bulk merged from the softer-lined landscape
BTS I do know now that we shall go clear
BTS The half-breed tried to drive him away with the whip
BTS D'ye hear it squeal
BTS The boat was close at hand now and in desperate plight
BTS Yes all said and done I think it vastly better for you to remain and sleep and rest and do nothing
BTS but I was left alone in my little hut glowing warmly through and through with a pleasant satisfaction
BTS And further the police had arranged in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man and he was travelling light
BTS His heart was not in the work nor was the heart of any dog
BTS This was in Michigan across the lake from Chicago
BTS As they circled about snarling ears laid back keenly watchful for the advantage the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity
BTS The wall inside which he had thought himself as suddenly leaped back before him to an immeasurable distance
BTS others stood on their feet watching him
BTS But the other animals the squirrels and quail and cottontails were creatures of the Wild who had never yielded allegiance to man
BTS The doctors had always said that I had a remarkable constitution but I had never developed it or my body through exercise
BTS The boat was cast adrift though one of them called it a bloody shame with Yokohama so near
BTS The tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks
BTS Fresh air was on my cheek and biting sweetly in my lungs
BTS Say nothin' but saw wood
BTS Unless of course you have grown tired of my poor efforts
BTS It made little audible gurgles which distracted me
BTS I intend dying here
BTS Unlike any one else in the ship's company I now found myself with no quarrels on my hands and in the good graces of all
BTS He painfully lifted himself on his elbow and turned loose with his automatic pistol
BTS They were his environment these men and they were moulding the clay of him into a more ferocious thing than had been intended by Nature
BTS he proclaimed
BTS You herd with the capitalist class in another locality
BTS I asked
BTS He was too quick for the others
BTS Hill with his control of the Northwest
BTS When the topmen clear the raffle with their clasp-knives in their teeth' she quoted at me
BTS At first the wall had leaped beyond his vision
BTS Coffee
BTS All this was a spur to her pricking her to retaliation
BTS I can tell you this much We've not been asleep
BTS To his dim comprehension they were as much wonder-workers as gods are to men
BTS The greatness of sensation is mutual
BTS I started to gasp out my information but he stopped me
BTS But when one morning the air was rent with the report of a rifle close at hand and a bullet smashed against a tree trunk several inches from One Eye's head they hesitated no more but went off on a long swinging lope that put quick miles between them and the danger
BTS Remember also that your law is the stuff of a day and that you are not versatile in the stuff of more than a day
BTS And still no more dead men I twitted Louis when Smoke and Henderson side by side in friendly conversation took their first exercise on deck
BTS A snarl was the answer
BTS A band of twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber and chief among them was a great bull
BTS I had solved the problem which had arisen through the shortness of the shears
BTS And she had been steering seven hours
BTS It is the nature of the persecution
BTS I had selected it
BTS The mere utterance of it could damn any scheme no matter how sanely conceived of economic amelioration or regeneration
BTS Then it was that a cry went up from one of the men
BTS What the hell are you up to
BTS I must go at once
BTS But he still lives she answered infinite faith in her voice
BTS It was at this stage that Thomas Mugridge's erratic soul brought him into the scene
BTS They lived in more comfortable homes and in delightful cities of their own--delightful compared with the slums and ghettos in which they had formerly dwelt
BTS He was an individual
BTS You've got to cut it short
BTS Not that
BTS He would lie in a screen of bushes watching for a squirrel to venture far enough out on the ground from its tree-refuge
BTS Full into the firelight with a stealthy sidelong movement glided a doglike animal
BTS she queried
BTS The signs are favourable for an extensive practice this voyage
BTS In fact when he had but partly learned the law his impression was that he must leave all live things alone
BTS We called these wretched people the people of the abyss and it was to alleviate their awful suffering that the socialists had introduced the unemployed bill
BTS Thomas Mugridge so strangely and pertinaciously clinging to life was soon limping about again and performing his double duties of cook and cabin-boy
BTS Back and forth the bull tossed his great palmated antlers branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet within the tips
BTS but he recovered himself almost in mid air and the circle sank down again and waited
BTS The fortresses were crowded with Mercenaries the wind blew in the right direction and up went our balloons from one of the office buildings in the city
BTS Railroad bridges and tunnels were blown up and trains were wrecked
BTS She was getting very heavy and could run but slowly
BTS The village had gone away
BTS Every woollen filament of our garments every hair of our heads and faces was jewelled with a crystal globule
BTS was Hans's contribution
BTS The Danites taking their name from the avenging angels of the Mormon mythology sprang up in the mountains of the Great West and spread over the Pacific Coast from Panama to Alaska
BTS Then he and Judge Scott revolvers in hand cautiously descended
BTS No
BTS Again there was a puff of smoke and a loud report this time the cannon-ball striking not more than twenty feet astern and glancing twice from sea to sea to windward ere it sank
BTS The taste of the salt was strong in my mouth and I was strangling with the acrid stuff in my throat and lungs
BTS Then he resumed his course and trotted on along the base of the bluff
BTS If it's yer luck to ever make 'Frisco once more will you hunt up Matt McCarthy
BTS He had killed man the noblest game of all and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang
BTS What better evidence could be advanced to prove that education was dominated by the capitalist class
BTS With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air
BTS The greater the odds the greater the thrill
BTS She threw her head back in a queenly way but said Dear dear Endeavour Island
BTS Again the tiny point of black projected itself through the wrathful blaze a couple of points off our port-bow
BTS The dead and dying went down and made room
BTS The noise he made was too much for the moose-bird who sought safety in flight
BTS I thought of our snug little huts our supplies of meat and oil and moss and firewood and I knew that we could never survive the wintry sea and the great storms which were to come
BTS But suppose the trusts win in this battle over the ownership of the machines and the world
BTS His strength left him and the last his mates saw of him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them
BTS Of course you do Ernest went on
BTS She made a moue of disappointment
BTS CHAPTER V THE INDOMITABLE It's hopeless Weedon Scott confessed
BTS Of all situations this was the most inconceivable
BTS Her lover was in one of the three disloyal regiments
BTS What d'ye mean by that
BTS An' you're half eaten from the way you're goin' on about it
BTS This is treason to your class
BTS Mercedes nursed a special grievance the grievance of sex
BTS I strain my ears and all my senses for some betrayal of that impending storm
BTS his lips writhed back and his little fangs were bared
BTS The cub had broken through the wall of the world the unknown had let go its hold of him and here he was without hurt
BTS And out of this classification arose the law
BTS And I wondered if she too felt it as we walked along the deck side by side to where the stalled foremast hung in the shears
BTS They were not land serfs like the farmers
BTS I should certainly have done so out in that world to which we belonged
BTS At such moments he charged Buck who retreated craftily luring him on by a simulated inability to escape
BTS No one knew of the first man
BTS I cried involuntarily pointing to the north-east
BTS I liked him
BTS For the first time I thoroughly realized the extent of the task before us
BTS He sprang for me with a half-roar gripping my arm
BTS Still protecting his throat and face with his torn and bleeding arm he tried to retreat to the barn
BTS Well Miss Brewster there is nothing small about the Ghost
BTS The light from it had beat upon his sealed lids and the eyes and the optic nerves had pulsated to little sparklike flashes warm-coloured and strangely pleasing
BTS It's all right it's all right I reassured her my arm passing instinctively and protectingly around her
BTS Can we trust our lives to it
BTS If Beauty Smith had in him a devil White Fang had another
BTS I asked
BTS In the old days he would have sprung upon White Fang in a fury of righteous wrath
BTS No chain nor stick bound him
BTS If you strike that dog again I'll kill you he at last managed to say in a choking voice
BTS So I stood with hesitant knuckle without her door
BTS Or else he probes them with the cruel hand of a vivisectionist groping about in their mental processes and examining their souls as though to see of what soul-stuff is made
BTS I must say I don't understand your technicalities she said but I do your conclusion and I don't like it
BTS and behind the will to enforce it was the whip of cariboo-gut with its biting thirty-foot lash
BTS In short the metaphysicians have done nothing absolutely nothing for mankind
BTS Mercedes's scream came to their ears
BTS As I obeyed I noticed an anxious light come into Johnson's eyes but I did not dream of its cause
BTS I was choking and suffocating by the time I reached Wolf Larsen's bunk
BTS He nodded his head in a pleased way
BTS It was a trick I remembered of my sister and I knew she would soon be herself again
BTS Also we shall try out seal fat for lighting purposes
BTS It was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears
BTS And I had not left the deck until three
BTS Never he swore had there been the like of this animal
BTS They quickly learned to leave him alone neither venturing hostile acts nor making overtures of friendliness
BTS I know my own mind and what's best
BTS I had half started forward to get over with what I was certain would be a stormy five minutes when a more violent suffocating paroxysm seized the unfortunate person who was lying on his back
BTS While you diligently pursued that favorite phantom of yours called profits and moralized about that favorite fetich of yours called competition even greater and more direful things have been accomplished by combination
BTS But don't do it just the same for I'd promptly break Mr
BTS He looked at Kiche licking her puppy and stopping now and then to snarl at him
BTS There was grave talk about the bacillus of violence that infected all men who embraced socialism
BTS And that night I slept on board and on deck beside my work
BTS Responsibility of this sort was a new thing to me
BTS But his fellows grew wise in their own way
BTS But I had preferred to use my head rather than my body
BTS It is the Master's work
BTS I am so tired she said with a quick intake of the breath and a sigh drooping her head wearily
BTS The two men however were quite cheerful
BTS Five or six miles from the lair the stream divided its forks going off among the mountains at a right angle
BTS We do not make the class struggle
BTS Idealist and romanticist that I was and always had been in spite of my analytical nature yet I had failed till now in grasping much of the physical characteristics of love
BTS Just glance at your draggled skirts for instance
BTS others stood in groups looking on and talking
BTS but he did not know that for he knew no other world
BTS W
BTS Tired as I was exhausted in fact I was prevented from sleeping by the pain in my knee
BTS It was a time of confusion and violence
BTS I had just finished sweeping the cabin and had been inveigled by Wolf Larsen into a discussion of Hamlet his favourite Shakespearian character when Johansen descended the companion stairs followed by Johnson
BTS I can think more clearly than ever in my life before
BTS The captains of industry had turned upon the middle class
BTS And so ended the night with the Philomaths
BTS The last sensations of pain left him
BTS she cried
BTS She snorted and tried to scramble away
BTS For nearly twenty years now John Carlson has been custodian of the refuge
BTS I mean that this load of ourn is gettin' on your nerves an' that you're beginnin' to see things
BTS Here life was clean noble and alive
BTS she asked gaily
BTS Judge Scott commanded
BTS As Lip-lip invariably won he enjoyed it hugely
BTS Faithfulness and willingness characterised his toil
BTS Watch out for Knowlton
BTS And in this was portrayed the victory of the spirit over the flesh the indomitability and moral grandeur of the soul that knows no restriction and rises above time and space and matter with a surety and invincibleness born of nothing else than eternity and immortality
BTS So it was that White Fang's method when he took the offensive was first to find a young dog alone
BTS Yet a bad effect was produced
BTS Leach pleaded in the first interval of comparative silence
BTS Don't dast tackle me so long as I got that club handy
BTS At a crossing we noticed in the direction of the stockyards a gigantic pillar of smoke
BTS Hours passed before his head touched pillow and I had soothed him off to sleep
BTS It became a nightmare
BTS It must have been the conditions she said
BTS It was Death's turn and it's all in the family anyway
BTS I caught sight of him toiling at the main-sheet heaving it in and flat with his tremendous muscles the stern of the schooner lifted high in the air and his body outlined against a white surge of sea sweeping past
BTS He was quick in his classification for he knew them at once for man-animal noises
BTS There was a crunch of breaking bone and the white dog faced him on three legs
BTS There had been no wrenching or jerking
BTS Let us see
BTS Labor out of work had no wages with which to buy
BTS A red-faced man slamming the cabin door behind him and stumping out on the deck interrupted my reflections though I made a mental note of the topic for use in a projected essay which I had thought of calling The Necessity for Freedom A Plea for the Artist
BTS I often remembered figures from that other life and curiously enough they appeared and disappeared now and again in my new life
BTS The Oligarchy wanted the war with Germany
BTS Under the oligarchs will flourish not a priest class but an artist class
BTS He rubbed his eyes and looked at them more sharply
BTS He had striven to help the unfortunate Harrison at the risk of incurring Wolf Larsen's anger
BTS My brother got me inside forty-eight hours and through no fault of mine
BTS The god had no club so he suffered him to approach quite near
BTS The fog though it remained had lifted high where it obscured the stars and made the night quite black
BTS He stirred them to discussion and analyzed their thoughts of life and society
BTS They lowered sails shot seals and hoisted sails again and continued on their way as I had always seen them do
BTS The man smiled grimly and brought a hatchet and a club
BTS Then an agent of the Iron Heel managed to become a member penetrated all its secrets and brought about its total annihilation
BTS My muscles were small and soft like a woman's or so the doctors had said time and again in the course of their attempts to persuade me to go in for physical-culture fads
BTS John Thornton was whittling the last touches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch
BTS But I'd do more than that to get a chance at the Philomaths
BTS He made me see things in new ways and I became a socialist
BTS I cried
BTS Maud Brewster had stepped inside the companion-way so that only her head was exposed
BTS The cows lumbered out of my way and the distance between me and the bull decreased
BTS Be careful unless you're looking for trouble
BTS I must have time to think I knew
BTS But how did I know she was fancy free
BTS But Mugridge leaping suddenly caught the jib-boom-lift
BTS Nor until well out of sight did he stop to lick his bleeding wounds
BTS I'll relieve Louis at the wheel he said shortly and call upon you to relieve at midnight
BTS Look at 'im run
BTS Yet you have not learned their lesson
BTS It is for my child that I cry
BTS So once again I softly kissed her hair as I felt her receding from my clasp
BTS Van Weyden
BTS He shaved hairs from the back of his hand glanced along the edge with microscopic acuteness and found or feigned that he found always a slight inequality in its edge somewhere
BTS He was sprawling along between some bushes when he heard a sharp intimidating cry
BTS It is a kingly word
BTS These men about me should have wives and sisters and daughters
BTS for they alone knew how to reap the whirlwind and make a profit out of it
BTS it interfered with her stitching
BTS The earth was carpeted with the slain and a final charge of cavalry with trampling of horses' hoofs revolvers and sabres crushed the wounded into the ground
BTS Thus he was on duty all the time ever vigilant and faithful the most valuable of all the dogs
BTS A low throaty rumble arose lingered on the air a moment and ceased
BTS As my fingers released hers she clutched for my arm hastily
BTS indigestion I retorted and continued my walk as if nothing untoward had occurred
BTS he asked almost in a whisper
BTS all of them
BTS The cook backed away a fiendish expression on his face the knife held before him in a position of defence
BTS Henry indicated with his head a second pair and a third
BTS Whereupon the cub covered its fangs and sank down submissively while the hand returning rubbed behind his ears and up and down his back
BTS It is far easier to see brave men die than to hear a coward beg for life
BTS I did not stop to see what had become of the small boat but sprang to the jib-sheet
BTS Nor did he scorn to do battle with a weasel as hungry as himself and many times more ferocious
BTS Skeet and Nig were too good-natured for quarrelling besides they belonged to John Thornton
BTS Once Buck went over and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up
BTS then the wind would sweep the face of the ocean clean the waves would ripple and flash and we would learn where we were
BTS The spritsail filled with the wind suddenly careening the frail open craft till it seemed it would surely capsize
BTS He had got upon his feet his ears cocked towards the door and he was listening intently
BTS When Mugridge was directly beneath us the stern descended the slope of a passing wave thus giving the advantage to the shark
BTS He'll learn to leave chickens alone the master said
BTS The face of Jim O'Brien a Mastodon King and old-time comrade caught his eyes
BTS I wish we could get some of it for the propaganda Ernest said wistfully
BTS And yet I found Colonel Ingram situated the same as the unlettered mechanics
BTS There were no seals behind us and ahead of us the line of fourteen boats like a huge broom swept the herd before it
BTS Especially were they cast out when their preaching became tainted with socialism
BTS Also I am to wear evening dress
BTS Eleven thousand men women and children were shot down on the streets of Sacramento or murdered in their houses
BTS The dog-musher let go of him precipitately with action similar to that of a man who has picked up live fire
BTS Leather harness was on the dogs and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind
BTS Lost overboard
BTS The workers threw down their tools and left their tasks by the millions
BTS We looked at each other expectantly
BTS The coinage of such phrases was considered strokes of genius
BTS I indicted your class
BTS I only remember one part of the service he said and that is And the body shall be cast into the sea
BTS Dat Buck for sure learn queek as anyt'ing
BTS Johansen who had caught the contagion of Wolf Larsen's masterfulness burst out with a volley of abuse and curses
BTS Morning had evidently not come so I closed my eyes and went to sleep again
BTS Come on over with us socialists and play on the winning side
BTS Labor buys back and consumes two billions
BTS Fighting was still going on but only in isolated localities
BTS I swear I saw it move with a strange writhing gesture of agony and with it lifted a head gory with nameless horror that gibbered at me and then lay down again and moved no more
BTS And before the wind we were and leaping when Johnson easing his sheet at imminent peril cut across our wake a hundred feet away
BTS Again I strove to call out but made no sound
BTS No you misunderstand the Bishop answered
BTS Also they feared him
BTS when the warp and the woof of him had made of him an adamantine texture harsh and unyielding
BTS It was a case in the parlance of thieves and police of rail-roading
BTS Understand
BTS Likewise was denied them the right to move from place to place or the right to bear or possess arms
BTS Back he circled across the drive to the other lawn and again she headed him off
BTS Riot arson and wanton destruction of property was their function and well they performed it
BTS Well I'll be gosh-swoggled
BTS But the slope grew more gradual and its base was grass-covered
BTS And lost your shoes
BTS It was drunk with success and little did it dream that that small handful of heroes had within them the power to rock it to its foundations
BTS It was a strange and frightful spectacle the small bunk-lined space the floor and walls leaping and lurching the dim light the swaying shadows lengthening and fore-shortening monstrously the thick air heavy with smoke and the smell of bodies and iodoform and the inflamed faces of the men half-men I should call them
BTS After waiting several days father wrote to the secretary
BTS Without them anarchy would reign and humanity would drop backward into the primitive night out of which it had so painfully emerged
BTS It was only the tame that the gods protected and between the tame deadly strife was not permitted
BTS They came and went resided in the populous kennels or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots the Japanese pug or Ysabel the Mexican hairless strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground
BTS Precious lot you know about dogs her brother sneered
BTS Calvin Ernest said slyly
BTS Just wait till we get in the Grangers said--Calvin said it to us in our Pell Street quarters
BTS But the bane of his life was Lip-lip
BTS To those who believe in Jesus and his gospel there can be no other relation between man and man than the relation of affection
BTS He became an adept at fighting
BTS He was a killer a thing that preyed living on the things that lived unaided alone by virtue of his own strength and prowess surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived
BTS But not by buzzing will we crush the bear Mr
BTS Humphrey sir
BTS Her modicum of strength had been exhausted and she was unable even to move from her position
BTS There was no escaping that grip
BTS They surrounded the cub and laughed at him while he wailed out his terror and his hurt
BTS This it was the screaming of the women that most tried my nerves
BTS Because of this new feeling within him he ofttimes elected discomfort and pain for the sake of his god
BTS And all the time the killing of the wounded went on
BTS Perhaps if I were to step boldly ashore they would cut for it and I could not catch up with one
BTS It crushed them into the remotest recesses of their own minds pressing out of them like juices from the grape all the false ardours and exaltations and undue self-values of the human soul until they perceived themselves finite and small specks and motes moving with weak cunning and little wisdom amidst the play and inter-play of the great blind elements and forces
BTS You are shivering
BTS Those men are cursing because their desires have been outraged
BTS Or does some one else feed you
BTS They were not prepared for his swiftness and directness for his attack without warning
BTS Strike me blind if this ayn't gratitude for yer
BTS His arm by the way has healed nicely though the scar will remain all his life
BTS I cannot bear to think of it being done
BTS To begin with at the midday dinner Wolf Larsen informed the hunters that they were to eat thenceforth in the steerage
BTS I stepped back separating from her and replaced the knife in its sheath
BTS You bet was the reply
BTS To betray his trust would have been in his mind a thing undreamed
BTS So important did it seem to the priest that he had the confession taken down in writing and sworn to
BTS Her brown eyes were like a startled deer's
BTS He sighed again and surrendered
BTS Pike the malingerer leaped upon the crippled animal breaking its neck with a quick flash of teeth and a jerk Buck got a frothing adversary by the throat and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular
BTS Chicago lay dead
BTS The clay of him was so moulded
BTS The dog-musher paused and nodded his head confidentially at Moosehide Mountain
BTS They starved
BTS Look here Henry Bill said unconsciously lowering his voice to a whisper because of what he imitated
BTS Take them aboard and deal gently with them
BTS I thought he'd let drive at him on the spot
BTS As I was sayin' Henry we've got six dogs
BTS Again he chuckled
BTS Weedon Scott had set himself the task of redeeming White Fang or rather of redeeming mankind from the wrong it had done White Fang
BTS And we could see that he was tonic-angry when he entered the room
BTS I could hear no calls or cries only the sound of the waves made weirdly hollow and reverberant by the fog
BTS A more surprised party of rescuers could not be imagined had they ventured down into our hiding-place
BTS But the wolves were growing bolder and the men were aroused more than once from their sleep
BTS and second when he had incurred the risk by dodging and by retreating
BTS The sailors looked at me in consternation
BTS Here was power
BTS He would now destroy a big live thing
BTS It was pitiable
BTS A gust of overpowering rage swept over him
BTS An' in a box Henry answered
BTS father asked and his face showed that he was interested rather than frightened
BTS The machine bothers my head
BTS She's close she's close
BTS Buck wondered where they went for they never came back
BTS They sold nothing
BTS But the hawk refused to come down and give battle and the cub crawled away into a thicket and whimpered his disappointment and hunger
BTS It was for all the world like a wave tossed up by the sea
BTS Their faces were set hard
BTS Where are you goin'
BTS If they will only hold their hands until the season is over he promises them a royal carnival when all grudges can he settled and the survivors may toss the non-survivors overboard and arrange a story as to how the missing men were lost at sea
BTS Colonel Van Gilbert quite forgot that he was presiding and that in courtesy he should permit the other clamorers to speak
BTS In reality this was the act of classification
BTS And fortunate was the trust
BTS Beauty Smith put his hands behind his back refusing to touch the proffered money
BTS You haven't any lawyer or business agent now so you'll have to depend on yourself
BTS but his communications were ignored
BTS And this out of all remains I made Ernest happy
BTS And greater than the trusts and more powerful is labor
BTS He never nipped Buck without cause and he never failed to nip him when he stood in need of it
BTS On one such night while all the house slept White Fang awoke and lay very quietly
BTS P
BTS A flush of angry blood pervaded Bill's face
BTS It was at the end of the discussion that Mr
BTS For three days this blinding headache lasted and he suffered as wild animals suffer as it seemed the way on ship to suffer without plaint without sympathy utterly alone
BTS With his one eye the elder saw the opportunity
BTS They were ready to lend aid to the revolution
BTS days of sleet and wind and snow-squalls when nothing could keep us warm
BTS His instinct had been true
BTS He was friendly in a treacherous sort of way smiling into one's face the while he meditated some underhand trick as for instance when he stole from Buck's food at the first meal
BTS An' now we make good time
BTS You have nothing in common with the working class
BTS He had travelled a greater distance than the other dogs in the yielding of himself to the rule of the gods and he had learned more thoroughly the futility of opposing their will
BTS Every fighting fibre of him was quivering and his face was the face of a fighting animal withal he was cool and collected
BTS Through these the tiny stream had cut its deep and precipitous channel
BTS In this village after the custom of all dogs in all villages White Fang went foraging for food
BTS I ought to know
BTS He had forgotten
BTS He got out of bed carefully so as not to disturb the sleep of his comrade and threw more wood on the fire
BTS He bounded towards her joyously and she met him with shrewd fangs that laid his cheek open to the bone
BTS He spurned him savagely with his foot
BTS and when he could not appease his hunger he had felt restriction
BTS Keep a stout heart were his parting words
BTS There
BTS As we came to the corner we saw the howling mob bearing down upon us
BTS He walked over to White Fang and began talking to him gently and soothingly
BTS He kept awaking and cocking his ears at the bright world without where the April sun was blazing across the snow
BTS The beating that had gone before was as nothing compared with the beating he now received
BTS and ere the day was done so well had he mastered his work his mates about ceased nagging him
BTS CHAPTER III THE REIGN OF HATE Under the tutelage of the mad god White Fang became a fiend
BTS This he did and he quickly achieved for them a mighty contempt
BTS I was jealous
BTS They were all on their feet now and White Fang ran down the steps looking back for them to follow
BTS Somewhat rougher I warrant than what you have been used to but still-man-play
BTS He had great faith in Buck's strength and had often thought him capable of starting such a load
BTS Go home
BTS Twilight had set in by the time this was accomplished
BTS Now
BTS His fevered membranes and burnt stomach began to clamour for more and more of the scorching fluid
BTS They were coated solidly with ice and the two men kept them on the run around the fire sweating and thawing so close that they were singed by the flames
BTS 'Ow can it be myde up to me I arsk
BTS They looked forward to it with as much anticipation as did the Indian dogs while they were not slow to appreciate the savage and crafty part played by White Fang
BTS she cried
BTS It is true it was a vicarious experience else he would not have lived to profit by it
BTS The time went by and the suspense to me was terrible
BTS In my excitement I had not been taking notice of other things and I looked up to see the lord of the harem charging down upon me
BTS ' When he says 'free opportunity for all' he means free opportunity to squeeze profits which freedom of opportunity is now denied him by the great trusts
BTS The aerial battle was over and Thomas Mugridge whining and gibbering his mouth flecked with bloody foam was brought down to deck
BTS It was inevitable that Milton's Lucifer should be instanced and the keenness with which Wolf Larsen analysed and depicted the character was a revelation of his stifled genius
BTS One was president and the other was secretary of the Western Federation of Miners
BTS Wolf that he was and unprecedented as it was the gods had sanctioned his presence and they the dogs of the gods could only recognise this sanction
BTS Finally he could stand it no longer
BTS It strikes me as unnatural and unhealthful that men should be totally separated from women and herd through the world by themselves
BTS Our plans I suppose Ernest sneered
BTS Positively he was the most disgusting and loathsome person I have ever met
BTS These executions were not haphazard
BTS No harm seemed to come of it while the noises the gods made were certainly not threatening
BTS Perrault nodded gravely
BTS Failing there he hammered it into the dogs with a club
BTS Though I suffer all deaths that a man can die To the uttermost end of time I have deep-drained this my cup of bliss In every age and clime-- The froth of Pride the tang of Power The sweet of Womanhood
BTS You must be wrong
BTS I saw the young fellow's hands clench at the insult and the blood crawl scarlet up his neck
BTS But when Buck finished his ration and returned he found his nest occupied
BTS In the meantime Thomas Mugridge like a drowned rat was being dragged out from under the forecastle head where he had cravenly ensconced himself
BTS I am afraid she whispered with a shiver
BTS but through it all following him persisted the howling
BTS We may expect to meet Death Larsen on the Japan coast
BTS I'll give you the mathematics of my dream
BTS But I had not reckoned upon the colossal task the reefing of three sails meant for one man
BTS he carried the Judge's grandsons on his back or rolled them in the grass and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard and even beyond where the paddocks were and the berry patches
BTS and finally the screaming bedlam of women
BTS It never seemed to me that she walked or at least walked after the ordinary manner of mortals
BTS He was pre-eminently unbeautiful
BTS The boat could not live
BTS As he had read pessimism into Omar so now he read triumph stinging triumph and exultation into Swinburne's lines
BTS Furthermore little children went to work on the machine-looms at lower wages and displaced the men
BTS I did not inquire why he had not been ashore nor did he ask why I had not come aboard
BTS This was promptly declared unconstitutional by the Luzerne County Court on the ground that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment in that it discriminated between individuals of the same class--namely children above fourteen years of age and children below
BTS He was almost at arm's length
BTS He became again sane
BTS Economic clashes were usually succeeded by wars and this particular clash was no exception
BTS It seemed our eyes must meet in a great understanding and yet loath they struggled away and did not meet
BTS Nevertheless he was a meek and lowly servant and there is no record of his having been insolent
BTS The dog-driver held the axe poised in his hand and as Buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad Dolly's head
BTS And see what you can do for that face
BTS Ah look at that
BTS It was agitated by no tremor of anticipation
BTS Describe her verse as the critics have described it as sublimated and spiritual and you have described her body
BTS It is the king of words--Power
BTS Yes he will have some beef-tea she said quietly looking up at me
BTS He was jealous of the isolation in which he kept himself in the midst of the pack and he fought often to maintain it
BTS Ernest was delicate in such matters
BTS In my fear I had forgotten that I was there to get the bull instead of to make him run
BTS I have seen him follow Wolf Larsen about with his eyes like an animal its keeper the while the animal-like snarl sounded deep in his throat and vibrated forth between his teeth
BTS In fact I was aware of nothing till I awoke how long after I could not imagine in my bunk with my boots off
BTS How it knows these things I can only guess
BTS He did not go far
BTS You investigate Jackson's case
BTS In a little while One Eye noticed that the quills were drooping and that a great quivering had set up
BTS The latter were afraid of him while he merely refrained from attacking them
BTS Had there been food love-making and fighting would have gone on apace and the pack-formation would have been broken up
BTS Van Weyden who harps eternally on questions of right and wrong I'd ask by what right do you live when you do nothing to deserve living
BTS It came upon me suddenly as strange that nothing moved aboard
BTS They patted him on the head and passed on contented and pleased with their own daring
BTS He can't keep this up Wolf Larsen said
BTS His attempt to maintain his dignity was heroic
BTS Nevertheless the delusion persisted in the wealthy class that an absolutely unbreakable will could be cast
BTS Dave and Sol-leks alone were unaltered though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling
BTS I shrank back from my own conclusions
BTS He was a superman a blond beast such as Nietzsche has described and in addition he was aflame with democracy
BTS Have some coffee Bill
BTS Paltry isn't it
BTS The god went on talking
BTS Nothing was to be seen of the strange steamboat which had caused the disaster though I heard men saying that she would undoubtedly send boats to our assistance
BTS No it was impossible
BTS Calvin
BTS At all times he was in violent motion now being turned over or around and again being smashed against a rock
BTS They made noises and at first he was frightened at them
BTS He turned suddenly upon Ernest
BTS Then here's a compact he went on consummate actor
BTS He discovered the mistake too late when Thornton was abreast of him and a bare half-dozen strokes away while he was being carried helplessly past
BTS It was unprecedented
BTS For now the dogs hated him hated him for the extra meat bestowed upon him by Mit-sah
BTS It was Smoke's unmistakable voice crying from the masthead
BTS At daybreak they limped warily back to camp to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers
BTS while the puppies themselves were being broken in to the harness
BTS Purpose does not explain that
BTS The sleepers did not mind
BTS Very true he replied
BTS What its nature may be I refuse to imagine
BTS My headache was no better and the surgeon paused from his work long enough to give me a powerful drug that would depress the heart and bring relief
BTS I remembered Ernest's charge that my gown was stained with blood and my flesh began to crawl underneath my garments
BTS He had essayed to walk along the trunk of a fallen pine
BTS His laughter jarred upon me
BTS It is all right I assured her
BTS The boy is willing enough
BTS And besides his swashbuckling was a fine thing to see
BTS On this night sleeping under my beloved shears I was aroused by his footsteps on the deck
BTS The statistics of this division are fractional
BTS In the meantime the rabbit danced above them in the air
BTS He stepped quickly to his state-room
BTS Served 'm right
BTS But the next moment he was calm
BTS No five
BTS Yes
BTS They were awed by what they had already seen of Wolf Larsen's character while the tale of woe they speedily heard in the forecastle took the last bit of rebellion out of them
BTS Even to the peeling of potatoes and the washing of dishes I answered to say nothing to wringing their necks out of very fellowship
BTS I queried
BTS Matt unsnapped the chain from the collar and stepped back
BTS The houseman is very kind but he must have his rent
BTS At the Rink Rapids two native huskies Teek and Koona were added
BTS Lip-lip was overthrown and rolled upon his back
BTS Its reasoning method is the same as that of any particular science and of all particular sciences
BTS Then arose the throaty rumble I had heard before and a dozen men were on their feet clamoring for recognition from Colonel Van Gilbert
BTS But this was not to be all
BTS Not quite he laughed
BTS For this likewise he respected his mother
BTS But I thought also of my mother and sisters and pictured their grief
BTS Its share of the wealth of the country consists of clothes and household furniture with here and there in very rare cases an unencumbered home
BTS This is the only copy of this publication that has come down to us and yet from its appearance and content we cannot but conclude that it was one of the popular periodicals with a large circulation
BTS It was as Matt had said
BTS Out in the back-pasture a quail could flutter up under his nose unharmed
BTS Then you were not at liberty to tell the whole truth as you had sworn to do
BTS I discovered that for those ten years my gain was just equivalent to a manager's salary
BTS They ate 'm hide an' all Bill announced
BTS Not that the outcome would have been different however
BTS I said
BTS to think and reason and in the spirit of him to be as alive as ever but in the flesh to be dead quite dead
BTS A little later the question came to me in another way What would the Master do
BTS Now Buck he said
BTS He sat on the step of his cabin and stared at the dog-musher who responded with a shrug that was equally hopeless
BTS But it was Boats over
BTS The set-back to their hopes made them despairing and desperate
BTS Then they were gone astern
BTS The garment itself did not bear out the assertion nor did the accumulations of grease on stove and pot and pan attest a general cleanliness
BTS The appropriation of the personal belongings of others by our own children of to-day is looked upon as a rudimentary survival of the theft-characteristic that in those early times was universal
BTS Buck was ravenous
BTS I went forward and took my station at the jibs
BTS About the wolf you needn't write
BTS He gave no warning with no snarl anticipated his own action
BTS There was nothing else for them to do
BTS You're a boat-puller now
BTS Good for Mugridge
BTS I was bruised and sore and aching in every limb
BTS Was Jackson to blame
BTS was his unceasing lament
BTS He had long since learned that the gods were made angry when their dogs were killed
BTS It was too good to lose but by nightfall I was exhausted
BTS No
BTS They are not philosophers
BTS The rest of the team however had grown unruly during the last days of Spitz and their surprise was great now that Buck proceeded to lick them into shape
BTS In the matter of meat his luck had been all in the beginning
BTS The sun had dimmed and faded out of sight
BTS I've told you what's what and let it stop at that
BTS Every word every cautious action on the part of the men impressed upon him his own terrible ferocity
BTS In short the things he did were done because it was easier to do them than not to do them
BTS and he will embody his message in his introductory remarks
BTS In fact the very opposite was necessary
BTS As it was with Buck so was it with his mates
BTS Why then I shall club him came the answer
BTS The next day we did no work
BTS I nodded my head humbly
BTS The glade ended abruptly at the steep bank of a stream
BTS But no harm came of it nor of the embrace from the strange man-god that followed
BTS White Fang was in Grey Beaver's camp when Beauty Smith first visited it
BTS His body was sagging at the hips his great shoulders were drooping and shrinking forward
BTS So far Ernest was right
BTS So run away he did violating his own nature and pride with every leap he made and leaping all day long
BTS the driver asked
BTS he cried
BTS Therefore against your strength the government will turn the regular army the navy the militia the police--in short the whole organized war machinery of the United States
BTS The more fiercely he fought the more harshly society handled him and the only effect of harshness was to make him fiercer
BTS And this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897 when the Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North
BTS In such industrial hells arose some of the proudest fortunes of that day
BTS From then on night and day Buck never left his prey never gave it a moment's rest never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the shoots of young birch and willow
BTS It was all well enough in the Southland under the law of love and fellowship to respect private property and personal feelings
BTS And they drew pathetic pictures of what would be the sufferings of the working class were it not for the employment that they and they alone by their wisdom provided for it
BTS give to the worker his product
BTS There's the beauty of it
BTS Leach and Johnson were the two particular victims of Wolf Larsen's diabolic temper and the look of profound melancholy which had settled on Johnson's face and in his eyes made my heart bleed
BTS He was continually marred and scarred by the teeth of the pack and as continually he left his own marks upon the pack
BTS And yet we are supposed to get justice by means of the law
BTS But there was life abroad in the land and defiant
BTS And I bent my head and kissed her hair softly so softly that she did not know
BTS The schooner sailed herself
BTS Outside of that there is nothing mysterious
BTS it is the nearest I dare approximate it
BTS We'll make them work and trust our lives to them
BTS and it was only by the exercise of an immense patience extending through many hours that he succeeded in gnawing through the stick
BTS He merely sprang to the side and ran stiffly ahead for several awkward leaps in carriage and conduct resembling an abashed country swain
BTS You do not live in the same locality with the working class
BTS therefore the picture must be accepted as a true picture
BTS What was the matter
BTS Twice his teeth clipped together like the steel jaws of a trap as he backed away for better footing with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled
BTS You are fat with power and possession drunken with success
BTS There was no way of penetrating the island from our cove for the walls rose perpendicularly from the beach and on either side of the cove rose from the deep water
BTS But the compensations of such religion are denied Wolf Larsen
BTS But after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously than ever
BTS Nay in moments like this I almost do believe
BTS Step by step before the advance of science they have been driven back
BTS Life streamed through him in splendid flood glad and rampant until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and pour forth generously over the world
BTS As the boat ascended on a sea her feet touched and I released her hands
BTS A hundred was the reply
BTS he barked
BTS What's right got to do with it
BTS But you read him misunderstandingly when you conclude that the struggle for existence sanctions your wanton destruction of life
BTS To my shame be it I cowered away from the blow and ran out the galley door
BTS I never knew what half a million dollars meant until I realized how much potatoes and bread and butter and meat it could buy
BTS In fact he never regarded the members of the family in any other light than possessions of the love-master
BTS After a time Matt returned
BTS Then get out of the way was the reply and don't bother me
BTS When he was rolled on his side he ceased to growl when the fingers pressed and prodded at the base of his ears the pleasurable sensation increased
BTS They advocated government ownership of such trusts as the railroads and telegraphs and excessive income taxes graduated with ferocity to destroy large accumulations
BTS And still later when we became assured of the perfect security of the place a small house was erected
BTS And why not
BTS His face became more expectant and tense as he tried to analyze and identify the impression
BTS All my handiwork was strong none of it beautiful
BTS He distributes to every man according to His own good pleasure conformably to general laws
BTS Six
BTS Garthwaite and I at that time were trying to make our way westward to get out of the territory of street-fighting and we were caught right in the thick of it again
BTS But when I got him into his bunk he again buried his face in his hands covering his eyes and as I turned to go I could hear him murmuring I am a sick man a very sick man
BTS The masts booms and gaffs I had cleared were gone
BTS Matt cried
BTS White Fang was very wise
BTS Watch out
BTS Then the wind came fair and fresh and the boat was soon labouring through a heavy sea toward the island
BTS This murmur arose from all the land fraught with the joy of living
BTS They looked at each other as they started to rise to their feet
BTS There was no bed-rock in them
BTS In the play of events my marriage sinks into insignificance I know so I shall barely mention it
BTS That is the crowning absurdity of the whole situation
BTS It was at the cutting-up of a moose fresh-killed that White Fang learned of the changed relations in which he stood to the dog-world
BTS The whole population including the favored labor castes was given a course of outrageous treatment
BTS To acknowledge your obligations before you die
BTS Once at the tree he studied the surrounding forest in order to fell the tree in the direction of the most firewood
BTS He seemed to have grown limp
BTS It was as though he had caught Ernest in a theft or a lie
BTS And romantic it certainly was the fog like the grey shadow of infinite mystery brooding over the whirling speck of earth
BTS They were taught and later they in turn taught that what they were doing was right
BTS You do not like me because I am too much of a man
BTS Hold on don't go yet
BTS Even your present wealth is not a true measure of your power
BTS Hammerfield was pained
BTS Always when hardest pressed for food he found something to kill
BTS By the joint effort of the workingmen and the capital money is earned
BTS He came to know that men were more just children more cruel and women more kindly and more likely to toss him a bit of meat or bone
BTS He no longer appeared at our Pell Street quarters
BTS Yes and no sir was the slow reply
BTS Nothing was safe unless guarded
BTS His arms were folded one above the other across his face and throat
BTS We even went on picnics to isolated spots we knew where we remained all day going before daylight and returning after dark
BTS Because I love you and like Ruth of old thy people are my people
BTS Not since the death of my mother had I known him to laugh so heartily
BTS But look at yourself Matt
BTS Once the cub sprang in and sank his teeth into the hind leg of the lynx
BTS And it seemed to me that my innocence of the realities of life had been complete indeed
BTS He assured me again and again that it was the last thing in the world he would dream of doing in a sober moment
BTS He turned them over and looked at their faces
BTS He would return and see how his own team-mates were making out
BTS This pamphlet had a small circulation among workingmen
BTS What they did is to-day a lost art
BTS I had to confess it to myself
BTS The camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking furry forms starving huskies four or five score of them who had scented the camp from some Indian village
BTS She pointed in the direction of the sea and wind
BTS What do you think the Sierra Mills alone give him twenty thousand dollars a year for
BTS A large paper bag in his right hand fell to the sidewalk
BTS We were very comfortable and the inadequate shears with the foremast suspended from them gave a business-like air to the schooner and a promise of departure
BTS Miss Brewster we had learned her name from the engineer slept on and on
BTS You will not deny that you are the cause of it
BTS There was something in that clarion-call of his that went to my heart
BTS He had reference to troop-trains on the side-track
BTS How old is she
BTS By night it was dead calm and I was toiling once more at the oars but weakly most weakly
BTS How long she had been there in that suffocating atmosphere I could not guess
BTS Van Weyden I congratulate you
BTS And the worst of it is he knows it
BTS Van Weyden Wolf Larsen called to me
BTS but honestly I'd rather stay
BTS He came back with it and assaulted the window of a store behind us
BTS I reckon you've called the turn Bill
BTS He was the Wild the unknown the terrible the ever-menacing the thing that prowled in the darkness around the fires of the primeval world when they cowering close to the fires were reshaping their instincts learning to fear the Wild out of which they had come and which they had deserted and betrayed
BTS He sprang to his feet waving his arms and for a moment could utter only incoherent sounds
BTS We've been passing them all night
BTS He walked to the galley
BTS They were violent
BTS Quite true Hump quite true
BTS I'd like to see how it works
BTS Everybody seemed interested in what was going on amid ships
BTS That he allowed the master these liberties was no reason that he should be a common dog loving here and loving there everybody's property for a romp and good time
BTS The team-dogs were swept back against the cliff at the first onset
BTS Love genuine passionate love was his for the first time
BTS I was to see many dead that day but the total carnage was not to affect me as did this first forlorn body lying there at my feet abandoned on the pavement
BTS Twenty thousand copies of father's book were in the bindery and the presses were turning off more
BTS the void in him sprang up and pressed against him with its emptiness and the hunger gnawed and gnawed unceasingly
BTS The insurance companies charge the highly trained chemists that handle explosives eight times what they charge the workingmen
BTS Canned goods were turned out that made men laugh for canned goods on the Long Trail is a thing to dream about
BTS He lived again all his days with Beauty Smith and the fights he had fought
BTS What can be done with it
BTS I asked impulsively for he had voiced my own fear
BTS The fire crackled
BTS I watched him build the fire and set about cooking food for himself
BTS And for the space of several minutes he lay there quiet indulging his grotesque fancy
BTS It's all right
BTS One reason was that he had fallen in love with Anna Roylston and the other was that he had become one of us
BTS His teeth closed on Spitz's left fore leg
BTS Say you lemme alone
BTS He was a beast a human beast it is true but nevertheless so terrible a beast that he can best be characterised as carnivorous
BTS Buck could not hold his own and swept on down-stream struggling desperately but unable to win back
BTS I never agreed with him in it and I disagree now as I write these lines more heartily than ever
BTS The first successful great trust--almost a generation in advance of the rest
BTS Because of White Fang's very great love a cuff from the master hurt him far more than any beating Grey Beaver or Beauty Smith had ever given him
BTS Being able to possess it I wrong myself and the life that is in me if I give it to you and forego the pleasure of possessing it
BTS I would sacrifice nothing for them
BTS It puzzled White Fang
BTS There is no other way of getting rid of it
BTS Spitz was untouched while Buck was streaming with blood and panting hard
BTS And then there was that faint and unmistakable touch of awkwardness in his movements
BTS Backward from the apex his head slanted down to his neck and forward it slanted uncompromisingly to meet a low and remarkably wide forehead
BTS Beauty Smith tightened the thong again and White Fang crawled limply and dizzily to his feet
BTS I felt an abrupt easing of the schooner a loss for the moment of all strain and pressure coupled with a swift acceleration of speed
BTS It shrouded Chicago in mystery and it suggested to the average Chicago reader that the Oligarchy did not dare give the local news
BTS I I don't understand navigation you know I gasped
BTS Good-morning Mr
BTS and I felt sure the leg was broken
BTS We would keep Philip Wickson a prisoner and educate him in our ethics and sociology
BTS He could not forget in a day all the evil that had been wrought him at the hands of men
BTS So he became the enemy of his kind domesticated wolves that they were softened by the fires of man weakened in the sheltering shadow of man's strength
BTS You mean
BTS ' Eh Hump
BTS It was the growl of the pack mouthed by the pack and mouthed in all unconsciousness
BTS The men tried to row with the splinters and had them shot out of their hands
BTS We who by personal experience know nothing of bloodshed must not judge harshly the heroes of the Fighting Groups
BTS He was very weak and when he reached the lawn he lay down and rested for a while
BTS 'Oo was there to send me to school or put tommy in my 'ungry belly or wipe my bloody nose for me w'en I was a kiddy
BTS Van Weyden sir
BTS History some day will have an excruciating laugh at their expense
BTS I always did think there was somethin' wrong with Fatty anyway
BTS What if all the poor people should refuse to pay rent and shelter themselves under the American flag
BTS Guarding against being trailed I made a rush of it for the Emergency Hospital
BTS But each time it was the bulging face of the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle
BTS I looked back at Maud to identify myself as it were in time and space
BTS he giggled
BTS I am compelled to Mister him and to Sir him with every speech
BTS In roar of shell and shrapnel and in whine of machine-guns will our answer be couched
BTS But beyond warning coughs from either side there were no signs of hostility
BTS White Fang bristling silently half-crouching as he rose sank back and watched the hostile act repeated
BTS A smoke pall shot through with lurid gleams filled the sky
BTS Every little while she emitted a low growl and at times when it seemed to her he approached too near the growl shot up in her throat to a sharp snarl
BTS At such moments he even closed his eyes and allowed his body to be hurled hither and thither willy-nilly careless of any hurt that might thereby come to it
BTS But you come back to earth at meal-time I am sure or when an earthquake happens along
BTS Ernest insisted
BTS Consider yourself and me
BTS H
BTS He never could forgive the way his father had been malformed--the sordid lies and the petty thefts he had been compelled to in order to put food in his children's mouths
BTS As he piled wood on the fire he discovered an appreciation of his own body which he had never felt before
BTS Calvin said stubbornly
BTS All his life he had tended and operated on the soft humans of civilisation who lived sheltered lives and had descended out of many sheltered generations
BTS the slaughter of the cotton operatives by machine-guns became classic as the most terrific execution ever achieved by modern war machines
BTS Bernard intelligence
BTS Jordan's final test of truth
BTS On the contrary it was even pleasant in a physical way
BTS They continued in the yards for half an hour
BTS '  I'll fix yer bloody well right' I sez an' kept right after 'im
BTS And they were proud too
BTS Never had he heard her snarl so terribly
BTS What's there to be afraid of
BTS Should 'a seen 'im
BTS Ernest insisted
BTS In this he was partially blocked but a dozen of the 'Frisco Reds were executed and the group was well-nigh destroyed
BTS Bit by bit infinitely cautious he approached the hand
BTS But White Fang uncompanionable solitary morose scarcely looking to right or left redoubtable forbidding of aspect remote and alien was accepted as an equal by his puzzled elders
BTS But there were times when even a moose-bird failed to affect him and those were times when he felt himself to be in danger from some other prowling meat hunter
BTS No matter what you do under your old tactics you are doomed to defeat if for no other reason because the masters control the courts
BTS Oh Humphrey
BTS A comrade I said
BTS Buck confidently selected a spot and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself
BTS Den we get one long res'
BTS What now
BTS Nor were any looks being exchanged
BTS He came out of a doze that was half nightmare to see the red-hued she-wolf before him
BTS It is wrong
BTS His own kind included his mother and himself
BTS Along came the steam-engine and labor-saving machinery
BTS Miserable and disconsolate he wandered about among the many tents only to find that one place was as cold as another
BTS He toiled as few men ever toiled and all his lifetime he toiled for others
BTS The god sat down several feet away
BTS I could see the pilot-house and a white-bearded man leaning partly out of it on his elbows
BTS I understand she said in a weak far-away voice and her eyes showed me that she did understand
BTS What power have the farmers
BTS And then one night Matt reading to himself with moving lips and mumbled sounds was startled by a low whine from White Fang
BTS Scott give the poor devil a fightin' chance
BTS He brought the Sierra Mills into court but he could not bring the books of the Sierra Mills into court
BTS Then was added to the uproar the cub's shrill yelp of pain and fright
BTS It will break your heart--it will break his
BTS Anything wrong
BTS As fast as the prisoners came over the rail they were marshalled forward to the forecastle by our hunters while our sailors hoisted in the boats pell-mell dropping them anywhere upon the deck and not stopping to lash them
BTS But this could not last for ever
BTS The whispers of wind became puffs the sails filled the Ghost moved
BTS I'll tie 'em up out of reach of each other to-night Bill said as they took the trail
BTS A rich man to-day who gives all he has to the poor is crazy
BTS No more were they worried by slack times strike and lockout and the union label
BTS and so greatly did hunger compel him he was not above taking what did not belong to him
BTS And believe me we foment no hatred
BTS No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
BTS In reality the wages had been raised much higher and the privileges were correspondingly greater
BTS Again the bakers of that time were terribly overworked
BTS When he grew tired he found his way back to the cave and slept
BTS Neither the business men nor the laborers had time or opportunity for SOCIETY
BTS Like giants they toiled days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped the treasure up
BTS There will be great achievements in science and especially in art
BTS and when the oligarchs have passed away their great roads and their wonder cities will remain for the brotherhood of labor to tread upon and dwell within
BTS I attended to making the boat secure and joined her
BTS In this purplish light Wolf Larsen's face glowed and glowed and to my excited fancy he appeared encircled by a halo
BTS The expression on his face was one of complete comprehension
BTS He knows the secrets of a score of our refuges
BTS Masts and booms tangled with shrouds sheets and rent canvas were rubbing gently alongside
BTS To White Fang Beauty Smith was a veritable if terrible god
BTS The earth struck him a harsh blow on the nose that made him yelp
BTS Not one word could he get out of them that would have helped Jackson
BTS The storm broke that night which is to say that it diminished as slowly as it had arisen
BTS Listen to that will you
BTS You little knew what you were choosing I laughed
BTS Like his first attack his second had been accompanied by serious disablement
BTS It's all over but the shouting
BTS Of course what it gave us in power we paid for in distance
BTS What is to be done
BTS After some time of this Francois threw down the club thinking that Buck feared a thrashing
BTS I did my own work and my own work only and when and in what fashion I saw fit
BTS I must say that I was fascinated by the perfect lines of Wolf Larsen's figure and by what I may term the terrible beauty of it
BTS also he saw a woman
BTS It was all very silly he knew
BTS but my sleep on the Ghost had become most healthful and natural and soon the songs and cries died away my eyes closed and my consciousness sank down into the half-death of slumber
BTS Get the firelight out of your eyes an' look hard there
BTS We could follow these tragedies only by the sound
BTS He left the chair just as he sat in it squarely springing from the sitting posture like a wild animal a tiger and like a tiger covered the intervening space
BTS but he's breathin' all right
BTS The food you eat is a bloody stew
BTS And it was the Plutocracy through its secret agents of course that encouraged the Grange Party and even spread it to the cities into the ranks of the dying middle class
BTS I saw it all from the top of an office building
BTS Comrade Biedenbach was absent-minded forgetful
BTS To crawl is piggish
BTS And then where a vagrant shaft of sunlight struck the ocean and turned its surface to wrathful silver I caught a small black speck thrust skyward for an instant and swallowed up
BTS We learned afterward how it happened
BTS I found her fumbling at the wall of the after bulkhead and half leading her half carrying her I took her up the companion-way
BTS In return he feigned anger bristling and growling ferociously and clipping his teeth together in snaps that had all the seeming of deadly intention
BTS Who's our
BTS The driver examined him but could find nothing
BTS Two by two male and female the wolves were deserting
BTS likewise was White Fang's fright
BTS He shook his head ominously and looked forward without hope to the fall elections
BTS And not one of you to get a knife
BTS To this and so close to the neck that the dog could not get his teeth to it he had tied a stout stick four or five feet in length
BTS It made him frantic this clinging dragging weight
BTS As the time went by I marvelled that I was still alive
BTS I set the breakfast-table in the cabin and at seven o'clock waited on the hunters and officers
BTS Shrinking almost shivering he still managed to hold himself together
BTS There there children father said soothingly
BTS Two or three times he put his head into the galley and chaffed Mugridge good-naturedly and once this afternoon he stood by the break of the poop and chatted with him for fully fifteen minutes
BTS He cared to serve nothing
BTS And if against every man in the mills why not against every man in all the other mills and factories
BTS but now that it was off he would show them
BTS And to his ears came sounds of the strange god's movements
BTS in the morning when they yielded up the damp of the dew and relaxed they were pulled tight again and that was all
BTS The canvas was heavy and hard and she sewed with the regular sailor's palm and three-cornered sail-needle
BTS I took the two women of the street to my palace and they are going to stay with me
BTS I also brought blankets and we made him comfortable
BTS I have not been sure he was saying and I have told no one
BTS It was at this time that a diversion came to the spectators
BTS In all of which Ernest joined loyally and energetically though he could not forbear now and again from saying apropos of nothing in particular When it comes to powder chemical mixtures are better than mechanical mixtures you take my word
BTS he cried to Buck
BTS So long as the system of capitalistic production existed labor and capital continued to quarrel over the division of the joint-product
BTS The high wind blew from the north-west for twenty-four hours when it fell calm and in the night sprang up from the south-west
BTS You have had enough of hardship
BTS Something terrible is going to happen in Chicago she said
BTS I talked with Johnson and Leach during the night watches when Wolf Larsen was below
BTS It is not beautiful I protested
BTS It will be the making of you
BTS Take no notice of him I whispered
BTS These strong oligarchs arose out of the conflict of competition and travelled the inevitable road toward combination
BTS And so it came that he learned there were gods and gods
BTS I understand you have money or your father has which is the same thing--money invested in the Sierra Mills
BTS The things not alive remained always in one place but the live things moved about and there was no telling what they might do
BTS Hello
BTS I have come to doubt that saying
BTS He favoured me with a vicious stare
BTS You'll have to put it in my hand Doctor
BTS Father was not a sociologist
BTS But Matt failed
BTS Grey Beaver laughed and nodded approval
BTS The imprisonment of Wolf Larsen had happened most opportunely for what must have been the Indian summer of this high latitude was gone and drizzling stormy weather had set in
BTS The elevation of frames of poles caught his eye
BTS It is the only answer that could be given
BTS Salary or piece-work
BTS he shouted in my face flinging off the hand
BTS They too were silent their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward
BTS I shall not describe the whole evening though it is a joy to me to recall every moment every detail of those first hours of my coming to know Ernest Everhard
BTS White Fang had quieted down and ceased snarling
BTS And this time he was beaten even more severely than before
BTS The tracks is there in the snow now
BTS The leaders lifted the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods
BTS As though from a great distance he was aware that he was being beaten
BTS And they work--in the mind
BTS Grey Beaver had intended camping that night on the far bank of the Mackenzie for it was in that direction that the hunting lay
BTS Oh won't somebody get a knife
BTS I cried
BTS A healthy young slip of a gale from the breath iv it sir he answered with a splatter iv rain just to wet our gills an' no more
BTS And if we're not
BTS Buck loosed his teeth from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat
BTS With the bursting open of the door the noise of their howling had increased tremendously
BTS He found Pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment of surprise
BTS An' I wisht 'twas three hundred
BTS Your illustration is most unfortunate Ernest replied
BTS His fee for this one act was five hundred thousand dollars
BTS She is asleep
BTS Once the sled broke through with Dave and Buck and they were half-frozen and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out
BTS It was a jealous note and he was very careful in keeping a respectful distance
BTS On either side the deck against the rail and bottoms up were lashed a number of small boats
BTS Wickson was right
BTS Weedon Scott pressed a button and the staircase and downstairs hall were flooded with light
BTS Utility does
BTS And if sight alone were not sufficient the cry of rage the intruder gave beginning with a snarl and rushing abruptly upward into a hoarse screech was convincing enough in itself
BTS on wintry nights he lay at the Judge's feet before the roaring library fire
BTS The machine with its human freight lifted in an upburst of smoke and sank down a mass of wreckage and death
BTS Then all the quills drooped quite down and the body relaxed and moved no more
BTS We found our socialist comrades confident optimistic of their strength and of the things they would accomplish
BTS This had been one of the things taught him by the master and White Fang obeyed though he lay down reluctantly and sullenly
BTS But you can't mean it
BTS Since the beginning of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles dragging sleds the whole weary distance
BTS At first my home was the tarpaulin
BTS That's Horner's and Smoke's work
BTS Is this not so
BTS Ernest laughed outright
BTS The look in his eyes as he felt the keen edge and glared at me was positively carnivorous
BTS And when they take me out of Congress Ernest replied coldly and put me against a wall and blow my brains out--what then
BTS and in that hole in the ground culture was higher and finer than in the palaces of wonder-cities of the oligarchs
BTS Were he not so terrible a man I could sometimes feel sorry for him as instance three mornings ago when I went into his stateroom to fill his water-bottle and came unexpectedly upon him
BTS It meant a fight
BTS There ain't a child at the spindles but what would curse me name
BTS so don't let that hinder you
BTS And here under his direct supervision for he went ashore himself Leach and Johnson filled the small casks and rolled them down to the beach
BTS He came to where Grey Beaver's tepee had stood
BTS I still insist you are dreaming Mr
BTS Buck learned easily and under the combined tuition of his two mates and Francois made remarkable progress
BTS Remember Hartman concluded earnestly
BTS Many of them he could whip in single fight
BTS The sled was broken out
BTS The master with his toe helped one sprawling puppy toward him
BTS but this wisdom now left him
BTS She had such faith in me
BTS Cherokee was too squat too close to the ground
BTS That's the way with you fellows he cried half angrily sentimentalizing about your immortal souls and afraid to die
BTS You must understand Miss Brewster and understand clearly that this man is a monster
BTS The hunters never more than roughly aware of the position of the ship nevertheless knew that we were close to the boundaries of the forbidden sea while Wolf Larsen's record as a poacher was notorious
BTS This time having missed the boat and not being in the same position as in the previous instances Wolf Larsen was compelled to resort to a different manoeuvre
BTS Better watch out Mr
BTS No matter how much squabbling takes place in one percentage or another the division is arranged
BTS The bear has said that he will crush us
BTS His rifle was between his knees but if he let go the steering-oar in order to shoot the boat would sweep around and collide with the schooner
BTS It is my phrase too I said stubbornly
BTS You beasts
BTS What do you think of him
BTS Chicago was the devoted city selected for the instruction and well were we instructed
BTS One day a number of men gathered about the pen
BTS Shorn of its glamour and romance Arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and womanhood
BTS Her arms were around me her hair was brushing my face
BTS Her lips met the press of mine and by what strange trick of the imagination I know not the scene in the cabin of the Ghost flashed upon me when she had pressed her fingers lightly on my lips and said Hush hush
BTS And she was spirit first and always spirit etherealized essence of life calm as her calm eyes and sure of permanence in the changing order of the universe
BTS And there was much fun and delight
BTS The she-wolf brought home meat
BTS He was assassinated in 1932 by Sarah Jenkins whose husband thirty years before had been killed by Farley's strike-breakers
BTS He did not know that he growled but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity
BTS I looked for the boat and while Wolf Larsen cleared the boat-tackles saw it lift to leeward on a big sea an not a score of feet away
BTS Capital takes fifty dollars as its share and labor gets in wages fifty dollars as its share
BTS All tense and trembling with eagerness and desire he mastered his instinct and stood still
BTS I experienced a positive sensuous delight as I crawled into the bed she had made with her hands
BTS Dr
BTS Billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night
BTS Some one had an arm around me and I was leaning close against him
BTS My left arm was numb as though paralysed and days passed before I could use it while weeks went by before the last stiffness and pain went out of it
BTS Just as the sky paled with the first warning of dawn I heard the signal from above and gave the answer
BTS Buck did not know of this and as he rounded the bend the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit
BTS An' I wisht I'd never started on this trip Henry
BTS Thus the farmers were compelled to borrow more and more while they were prevented from paying back old loans
BTS Where was Ernest
BTS and I forgave him his materialism because of his tremendous work in the world performed without thought of soul-gain thereby and because of his so exceeding modesty of spirit that prevented him from having pride and regal consciousness of himself and his soul
BTS but to be taken as a joke by others was a different matter
BTS They were starting dead weary
BTS It gave him a tremendous advantage over his antagonists
BTS Of a truth the nation had died
BTS The next instant he was on his feet but in that instant Cherokee's teeth closed on his throat
BTS Everhard is its prophet Dr
BTS Buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt
BTS For the last time he rushed
BTS He knew laughter and the meaning of it
BTS Then he discovered it
BTS I came on deck after a good night's rest in spite of my poor knee to find the Ghost foaming along wing-and-wing and every sail drawing except the jibs with a fresh breeze astern
BTS And still the Ghost foamed along racing off the miles till I was certain she was making at least eleven knots
BTS There seemed a relaxation of his expressionless face which was new
BTS You do not know that Bishop Berkeley attested that his metaphysics did not work
BTS I'm afraid Mr
BTS He's a corporation lawyer and corporation lawyers are not paid for being fools
BTS Then you separate sincerity from truth
BTS The book was published in 1905 of the Christian Era
BTS Kiche looked on anxiously
BTS The United States and the whole world for that matter will enter upon a new and tremendous era
BTS Unlike other materialists I had met and with whom I had something in common to start on I had nothing in common with him
BTS This was the first time Buck had failed in itself a sufficient reason to drive Hal into a rage
BTS So he remained on exhibition until spring when one Tim Keenan a faro-dealer arrived in the land
BTS she next asked
BTS Buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown calf
BTS had been his demand
BTS Besides there was his old antipathy to being touched
BTS White Fang enjoyed it all
BTS A column of thick acrid smoke the kind always made by black powder was arising through the open companion-way and down through it leaped Wolf Larsen
BTS But there is a certain sense of equity that resides in life and it was this sense in him that resented the unfairness of his being permitted no defence against the stone-throwers
BTS The week's rest had recuperated the dogs and put them in thorough trim
BTS ' He preferred the vanity and vexation to the silence and unmovableness of the grave
BTS And as for appearance he was the most distinguished-looking man in our society
BTS and with the jib-halyard to the windlass I knew Maud was capable of hoisting that most necessary sail
BTS and he was no more timid of a woman than he was of storm and battle
BTS The liability of shipping another such sea was enormously increased by the water that weighed the boat down and robbed it of its buoyancy
BTS and then I will pay my passage from there home
BTS Bernard father he had inherited size and weight but it was his shepherd mother who had given shape to that size and weight
BTS He seemed rather to have the courage of his convictions the certainty of his manhood
BTS Then the Church is dumb to-day as it was in the eighteenth century
BTS And as I picked myself up and started on I looked into the face of the thing and saw that it still lived
BTS Johnson squared away promptly and ran after us
BTS No woman was ever blessed with a gentler tenderer husband
BTS The aristocratic idea was woven into the making of them until it became bone of them and flesh of them
BTS I was once Peter Donnelly the scab foreman
BTS Two men were kneeling beside me working over me
BTS He had learned the law
BTS This was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward pell-mell crowded together blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey
BTS In my ears are the cries of the stricken
BTS below there
BTS And when outside I stopped short
BTS The pilot-boat Lady Mine Wolf Larsen answered grimly
BTS No story is too long for the scientist Ernest said sweetly
BTS Not more impatiently do I await the flame of to-morrow's revolt than did I that night await the coming of Ernest
BTS Her own terror rushed upon me and in that moment of fear the most terrible fear a man can experience I knew that in inexpressible ways she was dear to me
BTS It was between him and the master cutting him off
BTS The animal was certainly not cinnamon-coloured
BTS And yet it was in precisely this way that he was treated
BTS In truth his very death was incurred by his devotion to duty
BTS Ere they returned to camp he knew enough to stop at ho to go ahead at mush to swing wide on the bends and to keep clear of the wheeler when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels
BTS Many valuable relics have been found among which curious to relate is the smoke-consuming device of Biedenbach's mentioned in the narrative
BTS Beauty Smith regained his feet and came toward him sniffling and cowardly
BTS I descended to the lower deck
BTS For the pride of trace and trail was his and sick unto death he could not bear that another dog should do his work
BTS And responsive out of his deeps had come the new thing love
BTS I had learned to look more closely at life as it was lived to recognize that there were such things as facts in the world to emerge from the realm of mind and idea and to place certain values on the concrete and objective phases of existence
BTS Our paddle-wheels stopped their pulsing beat died away and then they started again
BTS White Fang's was a service of duty and awe but not of love
BTS The patting movement slowly and carefully changed to a rubbing of the ears about their bases and the physical pleasure even increased a little
BTS Five minutes later the landscape was covered with fleeing boys many of whom dripped blood upon the snow in token that White Fang's teeth had not been idle
BTS Pour it over your tongue till it tingles with it
BTS White Fang caught glimpses of it disappearing amongst the trees
BTS But why should you bring about the crucifixion of the Bishop
BTS Everything was swimming before my eyes and I turned sick
BTS You are certainly as safe here as you have been
BTS There was a silence I might almost call awkward till I broke it saying See those black clouds to windward
BTS Then the match went out
BTS From beginning to end the length of the stream was no more than five hundred yards
BTS The shrill little whistle like the chirping of a cricket amid the cries of great beasts shot through the fog from more to the side and swiftly grew faint and fainter
BTS Forgive me he said simply
BTS Henderson duplicated it selecting Harrison's right oar
BTS But a cold snap was on the thermometer registering fifty below zero and each time he broke through he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments
BTS He walked slowly and cautiously prepared to be assailed at any moment
BTS every movement of a muscle from the heave of the shoulders to the tightening of the lips about the cigar was decisive and seemed to come out of a strength that was excessive and overwhelming
BTS What kind of value
BTS In the eighteenth century in England men and women wove cloth on hand-looms in their own cottages
BTS and on the underside of our booms drops of water took shape in long swaying lines which were detached and flung to the deck in mimic showers at each surge of the schooner
BTS It was a little stream rising from springs and the hottest summer never dried it up
BTS Hunters went back on me
BTS Rockefeller owns Standard Oil stock worth between four and five hundred millions at the market quotations
BTS I have related this in order to show the mental calibre of the men with whom I was thrown in contact
BTS With the exception of the children the whole family was gathered about the surgeon to hear his verdict
BTS He laughed brutally and I was driven to the Bishop's defence
BTS CHAPTER XXXII I awoke oppressed by a mysterious sensation
BTS But if the Oligarchy persists I asked him that evening what will become of the great surpluses that will fall to its share every year
BTS What happens
BTS yet the boats lowered day after day were swallowed up in the grey obscurity and were seen no more till nightfall and often not till long after when they would creep in like sea-wraiths one by one out of the grey
BTS Do you know what I am going to do
BTS and where judgment was required and quick thinking and quick acting he showed himself the superior even of Spitz of whom Francois had never seen an equal
BTS What he was about to say what terrible castigation he was going to give me I never knew
BTS We talked for hours over single stanzas and I found him reading into them a wail of regret and a rebellion which for the life of me I could not discover myself
BTS Meat even meat itself he would forego to be with his god to receive a caress from him or to accompany him down into the town
BTS The audience had been growing more and more restless and unsettled and the faces of those that sat on the platform had been betraying greater and greater dismay and consternation
BTS Grey Beaver ordered meat to be brought to him and guarded him from the other dogs while he ate
BTS The Valkyries were women
BTS I had just the moments to spare if I were lucky to get in touch with some local leader before catching my train
BTS It did not take long
BTS Yet you say I was made well
BTS But this idea was dispelled when it was learned that he had sold all his possessions--his city mansion his country house at Menlo Park his paintings and collections and even his cherished library
BTS I am to him no more than a toy and he values me no more than a child values a toy
BTS He hasn't a chance in ten thousand
BTS and I confess ere the day was done that I hated him with more lively feelings than I had ever hated any one in my life before
BTS Still another time he stole into the steerage possessed himself of a loaded shot-gun and was making a rush for the deck with it when caught by Kerfoot and disarmed
BTS That was the slight difference that was left between the workingman and him
BTS While Johansen was summoning the watch below a couple of sailors under the captain's direction laid the canvas-swathed corpse upon a hatch-cover
BTS Cooky Wolf Larsen called in a low voice
BTS Savageness was a part of his make-up but the savageness thus developed exceeded his make-up
BTS On her other side ran a gaunt old wolf grizzled and marked with the scars of many battles
BTS Then the wind slowly died down
BTS I came upon Kelly crouching to the lee of the forecastle scuttle his head on his knees his arms about his head in an attitude of unutterable despondency
BTS Look
BTS He recognised One Ear's yell of pain and terror and he heard a wolf-cry that bespoke a stricken animal
BTS It was the Ghost herself that lured Johnson into signing for the voyage but he is already beginning to repent
BTS He could not have used a better word
BTS I shook my head
BTS Maud was still asleep
BTS But this time he missed by forty feet the boat passing astern
BTS And through it all the inevitable caste-weakening will go on so that in the end the common people will come into their own
BTS Indeed as I gazed at the heavy sea through which we were running I doubted that there was a boat afloat
BTS I sniffed
BTS Down in the depths of me I had a feeling that I stood on the edge of a precipice
BTS His rages and battles were pleasures
BTS Thornton alone held him
BTS He haled forth Wolf Larsen's soul naked to the scorn of men
BTS Come and see Biedenbach answered with his adorable accent
BTS He is clear up in the air
BTS What is the matter
BTS A sinewy hand dripping with water was clutching the rail
BTS And then came the foremast larger in diameter and weighing surely thirty-five hundred pounds
BTS There was a hint in it of laughter but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility
BTS Luckily as the outcome proved he had not divulged his discoveries to any one
BTS The soul cannot be ministered to till the stomach is appeased
BTS Thornton came to belly downward and being violently propelled back and forth across a drift log by Hans and Pete
BTS Had society then beaten him into submission
BTS In vain we tried to replace it
BTS It is the quiet that makes me restless
BTS Then we will know for certainty
BTS He was glad for one thing the rope was off his neck
BTS But White Fang soon learned to differentiate between thieves and honest men to appraise the true value of step and carriage
BTS Look at those three-cornered tears
BTS I neglected the boat and had the sail spilling the wind again and again such was my delight in following her every movement as she searched through the blankets for the pin
BTS ' There you are gentlemen American citizens and fellow-militiamen
BTS After a time it became his occupation
BTS This confusion in the front of the moving pack always caused confusion in the rear
BTS And amid all this bursting rending throbbing of awakening life under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes like wayfarers to death staggered the two men the woman and the huskies
BTS Thomas Mugridge is a sneak a spy an informer
BTS It was a sleep-walker Maud guided and supported
BTS They might have been granite for all the light and warmth of a human soul they contained
BTS It was the old indomitable terrible Wolf Larsen imprisoned somewhere within that flesh which had once been so invincible and splendid
BTS Yet I have here given Ernest's prophecy because it was his prophecy
BTS They was put aw'y wet sir he vouchsafed explanation
BTS Gawd
BTS On the fourth day lame and sore scarcely able to see so closed were his eyes he was haled from his bunk by the nape of the neck and set to his duty
BTS A thought struck me
BTS Instead and after a wistful searching look he snuggled in burrowing his head out of sight between the master's arm and body
BTS Several days more passed before Johnson crawled on deck and went about his work in a half-hearted way
BTS Extra chairs had been brought into the great drawing-room and in all there must have been two hundred Philomaths that sat down to hear Ernest
BTS When a halt was made they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs and the spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out
BTS I have found it so I added with an involuntary sigh
BTS For the first time the German war-lord faced the men of his empire who made his empire go
BTS This is such a little thing you know
BTS Those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp but a something which is best described as a roar and they saw Buck's body rise up in the air as he left the floor for Burton's throat
BTS The lawyer was perplexed and worried for a moment and I found it in my heart to pity the wretched little creature
BTS He was single-purposed and entertained but one thought or desire at a time
BTS Believe me the situation is serious
BTS The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags fifty pounds to the bag and piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge
BTS The soldiers were dragging the bodies away from the wheels when it happened
BTS It flows on and on and it flows from competition to combination and from little combination to large combination and from large combination to colossal combination and it flows on to socialism which is the most colossal combination of all
BTS At any moment that soft confidence-inspiring voice might break forth in a roar of wrath that gentle and caressing hand transform itself into a vice-like grip to hold him helpless and administer punishment
BTS You know I collected every weapon on board
BTS Buck threw himself forward tightening the traces with a jarring lunge
BTS so you live ignominiously untrue to the best you dream of sinning against your whole pitiful little code and if there were a hell heading your soul straight for it
BTS Step by step she was luring him away from the security of his human companionship
BTS The Iron Heel is here
BTS Grey Beaver had crossed the great watershed between Mackenzie and the Yukon in the late winter and spent the spring in hunting among the western outlying spurs of the Rockies
BTS As Ernest said all that was the matter with him was that he had incorrect notions of biology and sociology and because of his incorrect notions he had not gone about it in the right way to rectify matters
BTS so he was conceived as in their own image as a cloud a pillar of fire a tangible physical something which the mind of the Israelites could grasp
BTS Encouragement and advice were freely tendered and Jock Horner the quiet self-spoken hunter who looked as though he would not harm a mouse advised me to leave the ribs alone and to thrust upward for the abdomen at the same time giving what he called the Spanish twist to the blade
BTS But why
BTS But the reporters I objected
BTS Good
BTS He glanced casually at the huddling dogs
BTS And he knew I could not splice
BTS How much did the other mug get
BTS I noted that the boats were missing
BTS About the neck of each dog he had fastened a leather thong
BTS I could never forgive myself
BTS Another boat had been lowered by one end and still hung in the tackle by the other end where it had been abandoned
BTS he asked

BTS The Bishop had already arrived and we were having tea on the veranda
BTS All three faced him
BTS With an artificial foot and they make excellent ones you will be stumping ships' galleys to the end of time I assured him jovially
BTS Unlike most leaders who when camp was made and the dogs were unhitched huddled near to the gods for protection White Fang disdained such protection
BTS This suppression was performed secretly so secretly that at first we could not comprehend
BTS He sprang back with a snort
BTS So violently did the Ghost pitch and toss and tumble that it was impossible for even the sailors to move about without holding on and several times after a cry of Now she takes it
BTS That dog's too intelligent to kill
BTS By the way do you believe in the immortal soul
BTS Nor was this merely talk
BTS We had sailed since daylight across a sea barren of seals and were now running into the herd
BTS You are disgusted because the railroad has absorbed your profits
BTS It was beautiful spring weather but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it
BTS I asked
BTS Is it not true that that known as a trust produces more efficiently and cheaply than can a thousand competing small concerns
BTS To think was patently an effort
BTS But I could not shake them as I had shaken the mechanics in their employ
BTS Good dwellings modern and sanitary were built for them surrounded by spacious yards and separated here and there by parks and playgrounds
BTS Almighty God when I drain life's glass Of all its rainbow gleams The hapless plight of eternal night Shall be none too long for my dreams

BTS But his father was a wolf
BTS Now Girard Kansas was a quiet peaceable town

BTS Mercedes the men called her
BTS Then he rolled over on his side with a heavy sobbing sigh saying A sixpence is a tanner and a shilling a bob
BTS And well it learned the lesson
BTS That was all
BTS But my voice was a strange voice and in it he recognized nothing familiar
BTS Now don't say that this is what you get for bringing a woman along she said
BTS The mass swung clear of the ladder the men still clinging to their escaping foe
BTS Mr

BTS So I was in the army
BTS and he stormed and raged at them through the bars
BTS The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his steps to the camp they had left
BTS I heard Maud scream

BTS Good-night Maud I said
BTS Then there was a payment of bets and money clinked in Beauty Smith's hand
BTS Cherokee still holding his grip urged against him trying to get him over entirely on his side
BTS I cried trying to free my arm without hurting her
BTS Who was she that she should be too good for cabin table and cabin society
BTS In the morning Thomas Mugridge being duly bribed the galley is pleasantly areek with the odour of their frying
BTS Think of the long rest this winter was her reply to my remonstrances
BTS Dreams must be more substantial and satisfying
BTS Looks almost cinnamon to me
BTS The new-comer did not understand
BTS I noticed though that whenever one looked tired and lagged she let it slip past
BTS But it was only a way he had
BTS He has built too stoutly and too surely for that
BTS As his mother Kiche had rendered her allegiance to them at the first cry of her name so he was beginning to render his allegiance
BTS Hammerfield was angry righteously angry
BTS And still in the air the she-wolf's jaws closed on the lean yellow body and the weasel knew death between the crunching teeth
BTS In fact I had known life only in its intellectual phases
BTS What does your boasted immortality amount to when your life runs foul of mine
BTS We must do as Christ did
BTS The maintopmast was over thirty feet in length the foretopmast nearly thirty and it was of these that I intended making the shears
BTS The members of the great labor castes were contented and worked on merrily
BTS It is the bribe for living the champagne of the blood the effervescence of the ferment that makes some men think holy thoughts and other men to see God or to create him when they cannot see him
BTS Fire is fanned by the wind until it leaps up fiercely
BTS To be cast away on an island had not entered into my calculations so we were without a kettle or cooking utensils of any sort
BTS My heart leaped with gladness for I knew what he had in mind and I gave him the bearings west-north-west and five hundred miles away
BTS Sometimes he ventured north of Market Street into the shopping and theatre district where he sold papers ran errands and opened cabs
BTS What was the matter
BTS You're quite an individual
BTS Young life had little chance in such a famine
BTS The laughter of men was a hateful thing
BTS They made his movements a bit slow
BTS I spoke with a confidence she knew I did not feel for she looked at me with that unfaltering gaze of hers and said I have not thanked you yet for all you have done for me but  She hesitated as if in doubt how best to word her gratitude
BTS Hello
BTS But it was not all easy for White Fang
BTS It was no easy task waiting on the cabin table where sat Wolf Larsen Johansen and the six hunters
BTS He was still whimpering when the mother-weasel reappeared
BTS Death Larsen makes you jump better than that and you know it
BTS But it is absurd for you to talk that way

BTS Van Weyden'
BTS Nor were we confined to the refuge itself
BTS This was an error that was an assumption and the next was an assertion contrary to ascertained truth as printed in all the text-books
BTS How can they hope to keep our sympathy-- When we are compelled to walk Ernest said slyly
BTS The worthless ones were to be got rid of and since dogs count for little against dollars they were to be sold
BTS You are usurping one of my prerogatives
BTS He was dazzled by it
BTS No man makes opportunity
BTS It goes through the factory and comes out in the form of shoes worth let us say two hundred dollars
BTS What he might have done I did not fully realize till next day when he put his head into the galley and as a sign of renewed friendliness asked me how my arm was getting on
BTS but never once did they succeed in reaching the city of the oligarchs over on the west side
BTS A wolf is a wolf

BTS A tree contracting in the cool of the night made a loud noise
BTS And sought in vain for any place of rest 'Foxes have holes and every bird its nest I only I must wander wearily And bruise my feet and drink wine salt with tears
BTS Ballingford winced and every eye glanced at his prodigious girth
BTS The roar of it filled my ears and I saw Ernest reeling and falling in a swirl of smoke and the soldiers rushing up all the aisles
BTS Alas no I answered and asked Can you swim
BTS He made a futile rush at White Fang clipping the empty air with an outraged snap
BTS All night I steered without relief the wind slowly and steadily increasing and the sea rising
BTS for no longer as up to yesterday will the artists pander to the bourgeois taste of the middle class
BTS There was another soldier there a young man too
BTS It joined in the general strike out of sheer desperation
BTS He was standing in the same position swaying easily to the roll of the ship and lighting a fresh cigar
BTS It will never rise again

BTS They called themselves Sour-doughs and took great pride in so classifying themselves
BTS Understand
BTS When they depart from this they sin
BTS It is not nice for me I added
BTS What can you do
BTS Just what old Wilcox said
BTS And we must keep smiling faces and be friendly with him no matter how repulsive it may be

BTS Whenever strong proletarians asserted their strength in the midst of the mass they were drawn away from the mass by the oligarchs and given better conditions by being made members of the labor castes or of the Mercenaries
BTS A lie
BTS You are a millionaire in immortality and a millionaire whose fortune cannot be lost whose fortune is less perishable than the stars and as lasting as space or time
BTS He was homesick
BTS And always they pitched camp after dark eating their bit of fish and crawling to sleep into the snow
BTS Straight away he raced with Dolly panting and frothing one leap behind
BTS Maud shook her head and there was reproof in her eyes
BTS She turned aside and trotted over to it
BTS The Iron Heel at first dubious about dealing with the entire proletariat at one time had found the work easier than it had expected and would have asked nothing better than an uprising on our part
BTS But that's no reason  Standish began in a torrent of speech
BTS but he had come up with his back to it and the first thing his eyes rested upon was the opposite bank toward which he immediately began to swim
BTS He clung on for a moment long enough to drag the god over backward
BTS Later on when each developed individuality and became personally conscious of impulsions and desires the attraction of the light increased
BTS The hunters there were six of them to a man turned and regarded me
BTS Nevertheless White Fang was not quite satisfied with the arrangement
BTS I honestly could not understand what he was driving at
BTS He was wondering if I were making fun of him
BTS White Fang picked out the post for himself and Matt backed his judgment with strong language after the experiment had been tried
BTS They had no chance against us
BTS We permeated the entire organization of the Iron Heel with our agents while our own organization was permeated with the agents of the Iron Heel
BTS but I was reprimanded
BTS And through it all calm and impassive leaning on his elbow and gazing down Wolf Larsen seemed lost in a great curiosity
BTS As a result having learned the lesson well White Fang was hard put whenever he passed the cross-roads saloon
BTS You must take good care of him Matt Scott said as they started down the hill
BTS We have learned
BTS His allegiance to man seemed somehow a law of his being greater than the love of liberty of kind and kin

BTS We've got him
BTS As we drew nearer the firing ceased and we saw that the fight was over
BTS I don't know myself
BTS I was puzzled
BTS In what could have been no less than an ecstasy I left my post at the head of the companion-way and started along the deck murmuring to myself those beautiful lines of Mrs
BTS Whereupon the other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes and he would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep
BTS It was done artfully
BTS He was beset on either side by the merciless fangs of his erstwhile comrades
BTS This command was reinforced by a steaming kettle of water and at sight of it the sailors scrambled out of the way
BTS He seemed made to run on for ever
BTS They're not healthy here but I can't afford to send them away
BTS On it came bellowing with brute rage
BTS But it is equally true that he then withdrew leaving the gang to receive the punishment of the outraged gods
BTS The wolves swung in behind yelping in chorus
BTS White Fang's snarling began with the movement and increased as the movement approached its culmination
BTS The hunting for us was spoiled
BTS The laboratory preparation of foods had not yet begun
BTS He shrugged his shoulders or attempted to shrug them rather for the left shoulder alone moved
BTS The next moment a young man with a final slide down the crumbling wall alighted at my feet
BTS Furthermore the sled was of some service for it carried nearly two hundred pounds of outfit and food
BTS You beat the air with your arms
BTS They twisted his words and phrases away from the context and turned his subdued and controlled remarks into a howling anarchistic speech
BTS We must give ourselves and not our money alone
BTS for even now though Ernest is gone we are on the verge of the revolt that will sweep all oligarchies away
BTS Everybody broke out into roars of laughter
BTS There was the matter of the house--our home
BTS He too was lying on his side
BTS Beyond his snuggling and the throwing of a crooning note into his love-growl he had no way of expressing his love
BTS In fact so terrible did we make ourselves that it became a greater peril to betray us than to remain loyal to us
BTS belligerently demanded one Kelly an Irish-American and a longshoreman making his first trip to sea and boat-puller for Kerfoot
BTS The bulkhead was too thick for us to hear what he said
BTS He lay down low to the race whining eagerly his splendid body flashing forward leap by leap in the wan white moonlight
BTS That phrase the one small woman startled me like an electric shock
BTS It penetrated deep into the land and the tide setting in drifted us under the shelter of the point
BTS 'Tis sealin' is the sailor's paradise on other ships than this
BTS I was supposed to be Ernest's sister
BTS Her sense of humour was really the artist's instinct for proportion
BTS White Fang however was beginning to tolerate this act
BTS And then without rhyme or reason all sceptical my mind flew back to a small biographical note in the red-bound Who's Who and I said to myself She was born in Cambridge and she is twenty-seven years old
BTS He lives on the Hill back of the Mayfair bakery runnin' a cobbler's shop that everybody knows and you'll have no trouble
BTS Here was indubitable evidence
BTS You ketch um dog you take um all right was his last word
BTS You're promoted
BTS This is worth investigatin'
BTS A general smile followed in which Wolf Larsen joined and the dinner went on smoothly thanks to me for he treated me abominably the rest of the meal sneering at me and patronizing me till I was all a-tremble with suppressed rage
BTS No longer was this fact borne in upon him in some subtle mysterious way
BTS Bill stopped for a moment in order that his words might gain greater significance
BTS The sail emptied and the gaff swung amid-ships
BTS In vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down
BTS The stir of the life that was in him the play of his muscles was an unending happiness
BTS From his confession we learn that he was not a criminal
BTS But Ernest never lost his head in a situation
BTS He became quicker of movement than the other dogs swifter of foot craftier deadlier more lithe more lean with ironlike muscle and sinew more enduring more cruel more ferocious and more intelligent
BTS I know the w'y I do to myke myself uppreci-yted
BTS Now growl damn you growl he said as he patted the responsive head and rubbed the flattening ears
BTS Then there was the crashing about of the entwined bodies the laboured breathing the short quick gasps of sudden pain
BTS The manner in which they were beaten was unique and logical and simple
BTS Before me in the bottom of the boat lay Maud
BTS That is why the soldiers are present
BTS And look out for squalls is Louis's prophecy for they hate one another like the wolf whelps they are
BTS The cub snarled a little at the touch of the hand and the hand flew back to administer a clout
BTS Ernest demanded
BTS A shower of rain drove down upon us each drop stinging like a hailstone
BTS Scott you can't break 'm apart that way Matt said at last
BTS The surprise and hurt of it brought a yelp out of White Fang
BTS In the meantime the canoe had drifted down the stream
BTS I can hear him now with that war-note in his voice flaying them with his facts each fact a lash that stung and stung again
BTS He did not stand erect but with trunk inclined forward from the hips on legs that bent at the knees
BTS Behind every obstacle you encounter every blow that smites you every defeat that you receive is the hand of the trusts
BTS Wolf Larsen was demanding
BTS Curly and he were taken below by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called Francois

BTS He had too great strength
BTS Assassination or something kindred
BTS Certainly said Hal with freezing politeness taking hold of the gee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other
BTS No I answered firmly

BTS The she-wolf ran herself thin in the quest for meat
BTS At half-past five under his directions I set the table in the cabin with rough-weather trays in place and then carried the tea and cooked food down from the galley
BTS Supper was ready and Wolf Larsen and Maud were waiting for me
BTS But on the near bank shortly before dark a moose coming down to drink had been espied by Kloo-kooch who was Grey Beaver's squaw
BTS He chummed with the laborers and was an intimate in scores of homes
BTS And then across the narrow oblong box each nodded to the other
BTS She swayed toward me and I caught her in my arms
BTS The thorns sprung up and choked me
BTS but when both bestowed their attentions at the same time she was roughly jostled being compelled with quick snaps to either side to drive both lovers away and at the same time to maintain her forward leap with the pack and see the way of her feet before her

BTS After all I thought it is better and finer to love than to be loved if it makes something in life so worth while that one is not loath to die for it
BTS Here are our hands
BTS In front of me I could see the moving back of a man's coat
BTS And ever the light grew brighter
BTS There on a hatch a large man was lying on his back
BTS Therein you are both wrong
BTS I'll be coughin' blood before eyght bells
BTS His god was preparing for another flight
BTS He was certainly capable of anything
BTS There was fresh meat in camp
BTS Sometimes Mercedes sided with her husband sometimes with her brother
BTS The other looked at him incredulously
BTS It would be better if you remained
BTS He was suspicious of the looming bulks of the trees and of the dark shadows that might conceal all manner of perilous things
BTS A little later he got the floor again and in his characteristic way controlled it for the rest of the evening
BTS We elected a governor of Colorado and the legislature refused to permit him to take office

BTS I was prepared for him again to set aside my question and was surprised at the readiness of his reply
BTS I shall go on with my book
BTS The wolf-dogs clustered on the far side of the fire snarled and bickered among themselves but evinced no inclination to stray off into the darkness
BTS Never mind the exceptions and never mind the oppression and injustice in which the Iron Heel was conceived
BTS but I was not in the mood to have it forgotten
BTS White Fang crawled slowly cringing and grovelling in the abjectness of his abasement and submission
BTS Every hour every minute of my existence was in jeopardy
BTS He took no quarter and gave none
BTS This was an affair of the gods and no concern of his
BTS He looked slowly about him and I saw the glint of laughter in his eyes

BTS Yet he possessed his soul with patience and during this time of his torment when Hadly who had been brought for the purpose from Illinois made him over into another man he revolved great plans in his head for the organization of the learned proletariat and for the maintenance of at least the rudiments of education amongst the people of the abyss--all this of course in the event of the First Revolt being a failure
BTS But he laughs rarely

BTS She rode for days till they fell in the traces and the sled stood still
BTS But to him in appearance and action and impulse still clung the Wild
BTS You'll be without that knife when I come for you

BTS They came of generations of poor unlettered people peasants of the sea who sowed their sons on the waves as has been their custom since time began
BTS There was a difference between White Fang and them
BTS For some time she stood alone
BTS He had learned the lesson and in all his after life he never forgot it
BTS I can't keep his feet on the earth
BTS There seemed a certain spice about it such as men must feel who take delight in making pets of ferocious animals

BTS The cook quailed under it
BTS Who values it
BTS But the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more fundamental and primitive code
BTS He held the lamp close to them indicating them with his toe for his employer's benefit a steel dog-chain and a stout club
BTS Yet in spite of his style there was much that I did not like
BTS Some of the hunters glanced anxiously aloft
BTS Pivoting on his hind legs and snapping and gashing he was everywhere at once presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did he whirl and guard from side to side
BTS The cook borrowed a stone from Johansen and proceeded to sharpen the knife
BTS All hands

BTS He intended it for our comrades but he didn't give it enough time
BTS My reason dictates it
BTS Thus was I bluntly dismissed from the poop only to find Mugridge sleeping soundly from the morphine I had given him

BTS But this too quickly died down and ceased
BTS Then he stood without movement as before the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him
BTS White Fang bristled but waited
BTS There is the classic instance of the ferocious and wanton judicial murder of the innocent and so-called Haymarket Anarchists in Chicago in the penultimate decade of the nineteenth century A
BTS Thus it was with White Fang
BTS I am not a workingman cap in hand asking you to increase my wages or to protect me from the machine at which I work
BTS The first to go was Dub
BTS He turned and walked aft to the wheel
BTS He plunged into the forest and followed the river bank down the stream
BTS Also he was learning to drive dogs and to train dogs
BTS Again I raised the gun
BTS So he arose and trotted forlornly back to camp pausing once and twice to sit down and whimper and to listen to the call that still sounded in the depths of the forest
BTS Now if you did not have to get so close to the subject  The very thing
BTS As he stepped toward me I shrank back instinctively for I saw that in his eyes which spelled death
BTS CHAPTER IV THE CLINGING DEATH Beauty Smith slipped the chain from his neck and stepped back
BTS all these he must let alone
BTS As we entered I could have sworn I saw a vague bulk emerging to windward
BTS Then again came the prod of his instinct and the warning of past experience
BTS Don't you see
BTS I was one of those seeds
BTS Work thou thy will with me
BTS When they affirmed that they knew the working class he told them fundamental truths about the working class that they did not know and challenged them for disproofs
BTS this patience belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food
BTS His fangs be white and White Fang shall be his name
BTS He did not even appear on deck
BTS Though his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal he was too wise to rebel
BTS Much of the Wild had been lost so that to them the Wild was the unknown the terrible the ever-menacing and ever warring
BTS White Fang tried to draw the thong softly out of his master's hand
BTS I thought of his life
BTS When he laughs it is from a humour that is nothing else than ferocious
BTS Every two or three days a steamer another and colossal manifestation of power came into the bank and stopped for several hours
BTS Such a recoil is like that of a hair made to grow out from the body turning unnaturally upon the direction of its growth and growing into the body a rankling festering thing of hurt
BTS It was the biceps that had nearly crushed out my life once that I had seen strike so many killing blows
BTS he asked with the subservient smirk which comes only of generations of tip-seeking ancestors
BTS he cried
BTS White Fang watched the club after the manner of a caged lion watching the whip of its trainer
BTS They're remarkable thin
BTS Two years ago he dismasted the Ghost in a gale on Bering Sea whereupon the present masts were put in which are stronger and heavier in every way
BTS At a bound Buck took up the duties of leadership
BTS He rushed in and snapped and slashed on the instant without notice before his foe could prepare to meet him
BTS Nay Grey Beaver himself sometimes tossed him a piece of meat and defended him against the other dogs in the eating of it
BTS I was never sick in my life
BTS I don't see how I am to teach you I made protest
BTS Dr
BTS Piece-work she answered promptly
BTS Johnson as Johnson was unrecognizable
BTS She at least was warm for under her and over her were thick blankets
BTS His lip curled in a swift sneer
BTS the man cried again this time with sharpness and authority
BTS Little opportunity was given White Fang to see all this
BTS At once he heard and answered her and at once she came to me
BTS But Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck
BTS And again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground
BTS Only Spitz quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth snarling with horrible menace as though to frighten off impending death
BTS You should have seen him before then
BTS Both tackles were hooked in a trice and the three men deftly timing the roll made a simultaneous leap aboard the schooner
BTS May I never shoot a seal again if that ain't a woman
BTS When he had thus disappeared within his shelter of flame the whole pack came curiously to the rim of the fire to see what had become of him
BTS he queried half petulantly
BTS In fact no ready-made suit of clothes ever could fit his body
BTS so that I forgot myself and my mate's duties and took no part in helping the new-comers aboard
BTS All of which is neither here nor there
BTS Also I have enjoyed working it out
BTS He was armed with the weapons of the slain guards a live arsenal that fled through the hills pursued by the organised might of society
BTS As I buttered a piece of bread my eyes chanced to rest upon my hand
BTS Again I heaved it up to its old position for I had now another idea
BTS He was not responsible
BTS then with a tired sigh that was almost a grunt she curled her body in relaxed her legs and dropped down her head toward the entrance
BTS My youth has nothing to do with what I have enunciated
BTS and I was terribly impressed by the tragedy of a sane normal saintly man being crushed by the brutal will of society
BTS I do not like the picture
BTS The dancing tremulous light was in her eyes
BTS The longer he walked the better he walked
BTS Dr
BTS It was reported that the defection of the Mercenaries in California had become so serious that half a dozen regiments had been disbanded and broken and that their members with their families had been driven from their own city and on into the labor-ghettos
BTS There were scientific works too among which were represented men such as Tyndall Proctor and Darwin
BTS There is no such law
BTS But the Outside dogs though practically broken in since their landing did not amount to much
BTS It was not the citizens of Girard that composed the mob
BTS This famine was not a long one but it was severe while it lasted
BTS He never joined the revolutionists
BTS Within half an hour after leaving the train I was on board a small fishing boat and out on the waters of San Francisco Bay
BTS One Eye came to her
BTS And even a multitude of angels can dance on the point of a needle--in the mind Ernest went on reflectively
BTS She had known better than the blundering gods
BTS We must have been struck squarely amidships for I saw nothing the strange steamboat having passed beyond my line of vision
BTS He had never fought before with a dog with which he could not close
BTS Maud queried loudly in the ear
BTS What remains
BTS I had seen the boat-steerers and hunters set their spritsails many times yet this was my first attempt
BTS The oligarchs have already developed caste among themselves
BTS Insolence
BTS Beauty Smith's remaining leg left the ground and his whole body seemed to lift into the air as he turned over backward and struck the snow
BTS And then one day again out in the back-pasture he saw Dick start a jackrabbit and run it
BTS I made it
BTS The man on the Lady Mine laughed back through the megaphone
BTS I scarcely dared look at her just then for the fear of betraying myself
BTS We'd have six dogs at the present time 'stead of three if it wasn't for her
BTS Without pausing for breath though my heart was beating like a trip-hammer from my exertions I sprang to the topsails and before the wind had become too strong we had them fairly set and were coiling down
BTS I do not ask you to prove it to me
BTS Hoist in your boat I said he repeated this time in sharper tones as they hesitated to do his bidding
BTS But in spite of this great love he bore John Thornton which seemed to bespeak the soft civilizing influence the strain of the primitive which the Northland had aroused in him remained alive and active
BTS And it was a beating
BTS I heard Latimer shout down the scuttle too cautious to descend into the inferno of passion he could hear raging beneath him in the darkness
BTS And not one of them was a free agent he said
BTS We will rise in our strength
BTS I'll have to take 'm ashore with me
BTS but he always waited was always there
BTS There was just the faintest wind from the westward
BTS There was something ominous in his silence his immobility
BTS And I'll bet he sleeps in it Harrison added
BTS The people of the abyss had nothing to lose but the misery and pain of living
BTS If you open your mouth when you get back to Dawson I'll have you run out of town
BTS For days and nights he bellowed his rage at the universe
BTS Mackenzie hounds Eskimo and Labrador dogs huskies and Malemutes all tried it on him and all failed
BTS When father became convinced that the book had actually been suppressed he tried to get the fact into the newspapers
BTS Besides my work in the cabin with its four small state-rooms I was supposed to be his assistant in the galley and my colossal ignorance concerning such things as peeling potatoes or washing greasy pots was a source of unending and sarcastic wonder to him
BTS He yielded till the hand almost touched him
BTS In some respects despite his great economic and sociological contributions and his work as a general leader in the Revolution his organization of the Fighting Groups must be regarded as his greatest achievement
BTS Even as late as that period cream and butter were still crudely extracted from cow's milk
BTS Too damned fat and lazy to stand a four-hour watch
BTS he demanded back
BTS The trial was prompt and brief
BTS he groaned and the clenched fists were raised again to the infinite despair with which his throat vibrated
BTS 'I told him that we would walk upon the faces of the working class
BTS The hair bristled upon the grey cub's back but it bristled silently
BTS All the same we'll go on to Dawson
BTS The roof barely cleared her head
BTS What was his god's was to be defended against all the world even to the extent of biting other gods
BTS Beyond a sailor at the wheel who stared curiously across the top of the cabin I attracted no notice whatever
BTS These things the oligarchs will do because they cannot help doing them
BTS The seas previously encountered were as ripples compared with these which ran a half-mile from crest to crest and which upreared I am confident above our masthead
BTS When he watched the hairy man sleeping by the fire head between his knees and hands clasped above Buck saw that he slept restlessly with many starts and awakenings at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness and fling more wood upon the fire
BTS Also it very frequently got out special editions of from two to five millions
BTS I could feel my knee through my clothes swelling and swelling and I was sick and faint from the pain of it
BTS Before his eyes closed the wolves had drawn too near for safety
BTS Our conclusion is merely presumptive
BTS It was a difficult cast to make on a rolling ship but the sharp point of the spike whistling seventy-five feet through the air barely missed Wolf Larsen's head as he emerged from the cabin companion-way and drove its length two inches and over into the solid deck-planking
BTS Then it so happens that I am behaving differently for my purse and my soul have both been touched
BTS I cleared my throat of a huskiness which prevented speech
BTS Ran you right into a trap
BTS Then an old wolf gaunt and battle-scarred came forward
BTS I was swept on by those behind and could not look down and see and yet I knew that it was a woman who had fallen and who was being trampled into the pavement by thousands of successive feet
BTS Silence settled down again over the lonely land
BTS I asked
BTS A thousand dollars if you take me ashore
BTS You have buzzed like gnats about a bear
BTS but therefore the more outrage to his dignity and his anger waxed and waxed
BTS Yet if I married I should not dare to have any
BTS Spitz was equally willing
BTS The hand poised like doom above him hesitated and the man spoke laughing Wabam wabisca ip pit tah
BTS I did not get an answer
BTS Holding him suspended with one hand with the other hand he proceeded to give him a beating
BTS That club was a revelation
BTS But there was a look of bewilderment also in her eyes
BTS Everhard said the other night the function you churchmen perform is to maintain the established order of society and society is established on that foundation
BTS you can all but speak
BTS You know dear heart how proud I am because you love me
BTS Buck heard the chaffering saw the money pass between the man and the Government agent and knew that the Scotch half-breed and the mail-train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of Perrault and Francois and the others who had gone before
BTS But she proceeded to punish him roundly until he gave over all attempts at placation and whirled in a circle his head away from her his shoulders receiving the punishment of her teeth
BTS I know with the possible exception of the incident of the dead mate that I have not seen him really angry
BTS You have risen up as you to-day rise up shamelessly in our legislative halls and declared that profits were impossible without the toil of children and babes
BTS We the people do not pay our judges sufficiently
BTS It was the first night I had spent under cover in several months and I lay luxuriously for some minutes under my blankets for once not wet with fog or spray analysing first the effect produced upon me by the cessation of the wind and next the joy which was mine from resting on the mattress made by Maud's hands
BTS The famine was gone
BTS You belong in the enemy's camp
BTS Johnson turned obediently to the door at the same time over the cook's shoulder favouring me with an amazingly solemn and portentous wink as though to emphasize his interrupted remark and the need for me to be soft-spoken with the captain
BTS Well done
BTS but there is enough of the artist in me to appreciate its wonder
BTS I am proud of you Maud
BTS It was not so much White Fang's ferocity as it was his silence that unnerved the groom
BTS Where now was our project of remasting the Ghost
BTS Never in the history of the world was society in so terrific flux as it is right now
BTS He's not clean crazy sure
BTS But they were supremely interested for every little while they ardently took sides and sometimes all were talking at once till their voices surged back and forth in waves of sound like mimic thunder-rolls in the confined space
BTS and if he failed to find it like the Indian he kept on travelling secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to it
BTS All day Buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp
BTS This time I remained aloft and Wolf Larsen succeeded in heaving to without being swept
BTS My name is Johnson sir the sailor boldly corrected
BTS Matt exclaimed
BTS So he was harnessed in again and proudly he pulled as of old though more than once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt
BTS I flatter myself that I maintained my composure under the keen eye of the oligarch but my heart was beating madly
BTS His eyes were wide and staring
BTS Not at all
BTS Hated by his kind and by mankind indomitable perpetually warred upon and himself waging perpetual war his development was rapid and one-sided
BTS I knew well the noble nature of Bishop Morehouse and I could not conceive that his voice raised for righteousness would be no more than a little inadequate wail
BTS Asmunsen agreed are the creatures of the trusts
BTS while the reproving nudge of her nose gave place to the slash of her fangs
BTS And it is going up by leaps and bounds
BTS He struck Cherokee about the head savagely again and again
BTS You have failed in your management
BTS To disappear was in itself no easy thing
BTS '  Our Benevolent Feudalism a book published in 1902 A
BTS When you squeezed out the three small groceries here in Berkeley by virtue of your superior combination you swelled out your chest talked about efficiency and enterprise and sent your wife to Europe on the profits you had gained by eating up the three small groceries
BTS Johansen who had seen the affair from the break of the poop sent a couple of sailors aft to clean up the mess
BTS I looked to my companion for enlightenment
BTS It affected their minds as the many atmospheres of deep water affect the body of the diver
BTS But this was not done so easily as it is written
BTS The taste of it was good
BTS And now the call came to Buck in unmistakable accents
BTS Nor is that all
BTS When he was made the mould was broke said Pete
BTS I didn't sign for boat-puller sir was the reply
BTS The general strike took the form of a great national picnic
BTS And then they go ahead and do it unwitting that one of the weaknesses of the human mind is that the wish is parent to the thought
BTS We were surveying the completed seal-skin roof
BTS He wondered how and when the meal would begin
BTS The Revolution took on largely the character of religion
BTS He was warmly followed by a number of the others and the cry of all was to destroy the trusts
BTS It was his first battle
BTS We let down the bars and crossed an upland meadow
BTS it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their mighty hearts
BTS Couldn't see the necessity for it nor the common sense
BTS He lay down to rest on the other side of the open near the edge of the bushes his tongue lolling out his chest heaving and panting his nose still hurting him and causing him to continue his whimper
BTS But how can you account for it
BTS They were developing in him and the camp-life replete with misery as it was was secretly endearing itself to him all the time
BTS I bet none of the others would do it
BTS As she arrived at right angles to the sea the full force of the wind from which we had hitherto run away caught us
BTS After a few days sober and bankrupt Grey Beaver departed up the Porcupine on his long journey to the Mackenzie
BTS Maud was all this to me an unfailing source of strength and courage
BTS It is a base and unwarranted assumption
BTS Your own authorities with one unanimous voice will prove you stupid
BTS The salient thing of this other world seemed fear
BTS a pale face lustreless gray eyes a metallic voice and a languid manner
BTS White Fang was too helpless to defend himself and it would have gone hard with him had not Grey Beaver's foot shot out lifting Lip-lip into the air with its violence so that he smashed down to earth a dozen feet away
BTS yet you do not object to making large profits yourself
BTS Scott warned giving the final pry
BTS It seemed as though some great cosmic thing lay dead
BTS I need scarcely say that I was deeply interested in Ernest Everhard
BTS He did not know what a fall was
BTS The longest day never played White Fang out
BTS For a short three feet she was compelled to crouch then the walls widened and rose higher in a little round chamber nearly six feet in diameter
BTS At such times he betrayed no anger
BTS the stout gentleman who had been reading my essay encased in cork and canvas the magazine still in his hand and asking me with monotonous insistence if I thought there was any danger
BTS Owen answered
BTS It advertised itself in all his movements was apparent in the play of every muscle spoke plainly as speech in the way he carried himself and made his glorious furry coat if anything more glorious
BTS They finish in half that time
BTS to you
BTS The younger leader turned his head to lick a wound on his shoulder
BTS White Fang came in until he touched Grey Beaver's knee so curious was he and already forgetful that this was a terrible man-animal
BTS The hard times of the preceding year had thrust great masses of the proletariat beneath the starvation line and the continued and wide-reaching disorder had but sunk them deeper
BTS When he could no longer endure he would get up and stalk determinedly away from them
BTS Remember the tide of evolution never flows backward
BTS The life that was within him knew that it was the one way out the way he was predestined to tread
BTS He looked outside and half a dozen snow-birds fluttered across his field of vision
BTS I cried
BTS Square fitted into square
BTS I--I warned you he faltered
BTS The wolf was suspicious and afraid
BTS but he preferred to eat what he killed himself
BTS but already had the segregation of classes proceeded so far that the members of the middle class never heard of the pamphlet at all and so remained in ignorance of the law
BTS You little thought when you trusted yourself to me that I had had no experience whatever with small boats
BTS Dear woman
BTS It was too revolting
BTS Reprisals were bitter and many plutocrats and army officers were murdered
BTS And he didn't give me the dime much less the home and stock
BTS Where will your capitalist system be then
BTS I am not tied by my heartstrings
BTS But I called up all my resolution set my teeth and hobbled back and forth from galley to cabin and cabin to galley without further mishap
BTS For truly now he said I am feeding his lambs
BTS The next moment soldiers were clearing the galleries and I saw no more
BTS They were mere skeletons draped loosely in draggled hides with blazing eyes and slavered fangs
BTS White Fang came to him not with a great bound yet quickly
BTS So is desire like fire
BTS As the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the aid of their beset leader
BTS To be compelled to run away before the yelling pack every dog of which for three years he had thrashed and mastered was almost more than he could endure
BTS Thank you sir he said very gratefully and very humbly indeed
BTS We cannot forbear giving the following remarkable page from the history of the times to show how the need for reinvestment of the Standard Oil surplus crushed out small capitalists and hastened the breakdown of the capitalist system
BTS And all this he did with no hope of future reward
BTS But that was not all
BTS The other nodded
BTS Never was there such a dog said John Thornton one day as the partners watched Buck marching out of camp
BTS The lessons were not tender that he had learned of their tyranny and cruelty in the days of the Indian villages
BTS Matthewson's sled loaded with a thousand pounds of flour had been standing for a couple of hours and in the intense cold it was sixty below zero the runners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow
BTS He apprehended clearly his danger
BTS She appealed to everybody and to everything finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries
BTS We tried it
BTS The others sat down and howled
BTS Hist now between you an' meself and the stanchion there this Wolf Larsen is a regular devil an' the Ghost'll be a hell-ship like she's always ben since he had hold iv her
BTS You have made no food
BTS I should like to go with you was all she said
BTS This expression of abandon and surrender of absolute trust he reserved for the master alone
BTS And the result was willy-nilly that he was led away to a private sanitarium for mental disease while in the newspapers appeared pathetic accounts of his mental breakdown and of the saintliness of his character
BTS The only difference lay in that the patent medicines were more harmful and more costly
BTS I looked at the bleak inaccessible wall at my back and know the profundity of despair
BTS I tried to word my refusal but wavered
BTS This young wolf had attained his full size
BTS Dr
BTS They were greatly excited and made many noises with their mouths
BTS Whether it divined that it was being driven toward the lake or whether it was merely a blind squirm of the monster I do not know
BTS bones were the only things breakable about them
BTS Never in all his fighting had this thing happened
BTS I can scarcely bring myself to realize that that great mast is really up and in
BTS I never dreamed of such a thing Mr
BTS And it was for the same reason that Canada was lost to the mother country
BTS There was no power of recuperation left no reserve strength to call upon
BTS Hal's theory which he practised on others was that one must get hardened
BTS His face was ghastly white twitching with suppressed pain
BTS In point of fact it was merely a dinner for business men--small business men of course
BTS Mugridge and his behaviour and carriage were insufferable as he showed me my duties
BTS The next day and the next we saw the galley smoke rising and sometimes we caught glimpses of him on the poop
BTS You seem to worship at the shrine of fact Dr
BTS What are you waiting for
BTS Well
BTS You are an old man
BTS It's the she-wolf Bill answered
BTS The bird life had flitted
BTS and backward or sideways he would go in the air or sliding on the ground but always with his legs under him and his feet downward to the mother earth
BTS I should have been puzzled had I not guessed the solution
BTS And all the while I sat in a half-daze the drunken riot of the steerage breaking through the bulkhead the man I feared and the woman I loved talking on and on
BTS He was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn
BTS While really very estimable Mr
BTS The courier shook his head dubiously
BTS but the destruction of the socialist press and publishing houses constituted too great a handicap while the mouth-to-mouth propaganda had not yet been perfected
BTS I strove vainly to force my fingers down on the triggers and vainly I strove to say something
BTS For such countries nothing remained but reorganization
BTS Eighty feet beneath I could see the agonized strain of his muscles as he gripped for very life
BTS she said and laid her fingers lightly on my lips
BTS I finished my work and had opened the door to leave when he spoke to me
BTS but this new and elemental environment seemed to call for a savage repression
BTS But first I must say that his terrible diatribe had not touched them
BTS Troop-trains
BTS asked the imperturbable Smoke
BTS for a tiny man-animal took the other end of the stick and led Kiche captive behind him and behind Kiche followed White Fang greatly perturbed and worried by this new adventure he had entered upon
BTS We both laughed and then went seriously to work constructing the plan whereby we were to step the masts of the Ghost and return to the world
BTS I know my position is perilous and I may say frankly that yours is even more perilous
BTS We need no distress signal Maud said
BTS Unless very likely there's an Irishman in your mother's woodpile
BTS For half a day this continued
BTS I don't know about wot you s'y Mr
BTS but the animal betrayed no fear
BTS She gave it up and I heard her scream in a way that cut me to the soul for it was a woman's scream of fear and heart-breaking despair
BTS In the third year of his life there came a great famine to the Mackenzie Indians
BTS 'Twas called a sad accident but I met the boat-puller in Yokohama an' the straight iv it was given me
BTS Please don't
BTS Nor did he stop till he had devoured the whole brood
BTS Wolf Larsen asked and I did no more work that day nor the next nor the next
BTS We were running behind another train
BTS I called to her and the mast moved easily and accurately
BTS All of which you will pardon my observing has nothing whatsoever to do with what I wish to see you about
BTS Damn it all man
BTS She clasped hands about knees rocking back and forth broken-heartedly
BTS White Fang was too terrible for any of them to face single-handed
BTS Don't take my word for it Ernest continued when the interruption had been led away
BTS But he had a certain clear way of stating the abstruse in simple language was a born expositor and teacher and was not above the soap-box as a means of interpreting economics to the workingmen
BTS And through it all moved the Iron Heel impassive and deliberate shaking up the whole fabric of the social structure in its search for the comrades combing out the Mercenaries the labor castes and all its secret services punishing without mercy and without malice suffering in silence all retaliations that were made upon it and filling the gaps in its fighting line as fast as they appeared
BTS The fascination of the light for the grey cub increased from day to day
BTS He saw me but there was no kinship between us and with him at least no sympathy of understanding
BTS We've got him
BTS You must remember Miss Brewster that you are a new inhabitant of this little world and that you do not yet understand the laws which operate within it
BTS My father's new-born interest in sociology and the dinner parties he gave would not permit
BTS I had hoped for a peaceable victory at the ballot-box
BTS At such times confronted by three sets of savage teeth the young wolf stopped precipitately throwing himself back on his haunches with fore-legs stiff mouth menacing and mane bristling
BTS He did not understand
BTS Chicago was the industrial inferno of the nineteenth century A
BTS He sketched the economic condition of the cave-man and of the savage peoples of to-day pointing out that they possessed neither tools nor machines and possessed only a natural efficiency of one in producing power
BTS The force with which they struggled was vividly impressed on me
BTS You may gather data on the immortality of the soul
BTS CHAPTER XIV THE BEGINNING OF THE END As early as January 1913 Ernest saw the true trend of affairs but he could not get his brother leaders to see the vision of the Iron Heel that had arisen in his brain
BTS He had never seen water before
BTS Never heard of it he broke in
BTS After breakfast next morning when I had hoisted Wolf Larsen's body on deck ready for burial it was still blowing heavily and a large sea was running
BTS I reeled away from him and leaned against the cabin in a half-fainting condition
BTS His jaws closed together
BTS The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip
BTS Johansen do you know anything about navigation
BTS Violent death ever stalked in their midst
BTS I suppose that was why in spite of my twenty-four years I had not married
BTS His face remained expressionless as ever
BTS The ground had been bought outright and the house had been paid for when it was built
BTS It's burned badly
BTS He has held me in his arms and I mere I have filled that mind of his to the exclusion of all his multitudinous and kingly thoughts
BTS Well then just keep a-coming
BTS There was yet time
BTS I left him lying on the poop
BTS If you continue to stand with us we'll put an end to the reign of capitalism
BTS then you wouldn't be whipped
BTS Directly ahead of us I could see a bright red light and a white light and I could hear the pulsing of a steamer's engines
BTS But you'll 'ave to make them do till I dry yours out by the fire
BTS And as it was in Germany so it was in the United States
BTS Rockefeller began as a member of the proletariat and through thrift and cunning succeeded in developing the first perfect trust namely that known as Standard Oil
BTS We found that the division of the joint product that took place there was similar to the division that took place in the sum total of all industrial processes
BTS A boy was chopping frozen moose-meat with an axe and the chips were flying in the snow
BTS and he had survived
BTS First time I ever heard you say anything about their not bein' wise
BTS and Mercedes said Oh
BTS Search as we may through all the material of those times that has come down to us we can find no clew to the Biedenbach here referred to
BTS The farmers simply surrendered the land to the farm trust
BTS CHAPTER XIII For three days I did my own work and Thomas Mugridge's too
BTS I now caught my first fair glimpse of the woman
BTS The cook who was called the doctor by the crew Tommy by the hunters and Cooky by Wolf Larsen was a changed person
BTS Something has happened to Weedon his wife said decisively
BTS Also the dog-driver rubbed Buck's feet for half an hour each night after supper and sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for Buck
BTS Then the long black side of the vessel began slipping past so near that I could have touched it with my hands
BTS He was not immoral but merely unmoral
BTS While it packed the socialist meetings with mad enthusiasm it was impervious to the wiles of the old-party politicians
BTS How can we hope for solidarity with all these cross purposes and conflicts
BTS but in the few words he had held with me it had been clear and correct
BTS Maud was already rearranging his pillow
BTS She turned him over a prisoner to the 'Frisco Reds
BTS A moment later when he had recovered himself he said I always insisted that wolf was a dog
BTS There were over five million of them many of them in the standing army and in addition they were on friendly terms with the labor unions
BTS and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life of the toughest
BTS By me
BTS CHAPTER II THE SHE-WOLF Breakfast eaten and the slim camp-outfit lashed to the sled the men turned their backs on the cheery fire and launched out into the darkness
BTS The gods were all-powerful and a dog was no match against them
BTS I alone in the midst of a score of men was the only person unmasked
BTS I mean no offence believe me
BTS I have never thought so clearly
BTS While he yelped and ki-yi'd and scrambled backward he saw the mother-weasel leap upon her young one and disappear with it into the neighbouring thicket
BTS Also the farms and warehouses were the property of the Iron Heel
BTS And now you'd better get for'ard to your hospital duties
BTS She sank her fangs into her mate's shoulder in reproof
BTS But he had lost his nerve
BTS What was it
BTS and he answered curse with snarl and kept out of their reach
BTS Then came the underfeeding
BTS Through the open door he could catch glimpses of the luggage on the floor
BTS The rest were gone
BTS In the worst pinches of the famine he stole back to the fires of the gods
BTS But through it all I clung to the one idea I must get the jib backed over to windward
BTS The sticks 'll stand it and you and I will have to though we've plenty cut out for us
BTS The wave over-topped the Ghost and I gazed sheer up and into it
BTS I left the oar long enough to tuck the blankets about her feet and to pull a single fold across her face
BTS Perhaps I suggested again
BTS I am afraid you will cast off the masts in spite of me
BTS Now don't say Please please' I cried half angrily I do believe
BTS When he moaned and sobbed it was with the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers and the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery
BTS Directly his back was turned they were at it again
BTS To-morrow the Cause will rise again strong with wisdom and discipline
BTS I'll lock White Fang in with the chickens all afternoon
BTS Chapter IV
BTS Bill spoke gravely and slowly with no hint of the anger that was raging within
BTS but all the same you might be able to do us a favour some time when we need it damn bad
BTS I shall have to run at once to the wheel and at the same time you must be hoisting the jib
BTS Henry said the other munching with deliberation the beans he was eating did you happen to notice the way them dogs kicked up when I was a-feedin' 'em
BTS But it's a dead shot
BTS Ernest queried
BTS There the revolutionary spirit was strong
BTS I believe that life is a mess he answered promptly
BTS He had had experience in puppy fights and was already something of a bully
BTS And like a true Indian he settled down to trade carefully and slowly even if it took all summer and the rest of the winter to dispose of his goods
BTS Didn't he kill his boat-steerer last year
BTS It was Grey Beaver's will that he should go ashore for ashore he was flung striking heavily on his side and hurting his bruises afresh
BTS Pertonwaithe's great house I looked back at it and I remembered Ernest's expression that they were bound to the machine but that they were so bound that they sat on top of it
BTS Make up that spare port cabin
BTS He gave a short disagreeable laugh
BTS For that matter the professional men and the artists are at this present moment villeins in everything but name while the politicians are henchmen
BTS Mr
BTS The substance of the wall seemed as permeable and yielding as light
BTS Pertonwaithe and Mrs
BTS I often doubt I often doubt the worthwhileness of reason
BTS I call you metaphysicians because you reason metaphysically Ernest went on
BTS Your method of reasoning is the opposite to that of science
BTS Where's the mate
BTS The stick's as clean as a whistle
BTS This was meat the same as his mother gave him only it was alive between his teeth and therefore better
BTS We were agog with excitement all except Wolf Larsen who was too evidently disappointed in that it was not his own boat with the two victims of his malice
BTS Oh Gawd Gawd wot 'ave I done
BTS When next I awoke a sickly yellow light was filtering in on me
BTS Three came the answer
BTS I sawed and chopped and chiselled the weathered wood till it had the appearance of having been gnawed by some gigantic mouse
BTS He preferred suffering in freedom to all the happiness of a comfortable servility
BTS It was not a pleasant face to look upon
BTS It was the worst hurt he had ever known
BTS For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope
BTS I do I made answer
BTS A draggled muslin cap on his head and a dirty gunny-sack about his slim hips proclaimed him cook of the decidedly dirty ship's galley in which I found myself
BTS Pig
BTS He next became a private detective for a street railway corporation and by successive steps developed into a professional strikebreaker
BTS Their privation and hardships were terrible but they persisted
BTS but now he could see quite well and he stayed awake for longer periods of time and he was coming to learn his world quite well
BTS These I whittled into shavings or split into kindling
BTS He tugged still harder and repeatedly until the whole tepee was in motion
BTS In the darkness I almost embraced Biedenbach who came down first
BTS At my suggestion however he gave up smoking and drinking
BTS Take Collie inside and leave the two of them to fight it out suggested Scott's father
BTS We plump forgot the window
BTS The two mongrels were without spirit at all
BTS Many fragments of his work have come down to us while two of his greatest achievements Anticipations and Mankind in the Making have come down intact
BTS With the enthusiasm of a boy he plunged excitedly into these new pursuits regardless of whither they led him
BTS I followed her gaze but could see nothing unusual
BTS He saw the movement or heard sound and responded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere seeing or hearing
BTS This has been the strength of the Iron Heel and too many of the comrades have been slow or loath to realize it
BTS You have left the real and solid earth and are up in the air with a word for a flying machine
BTS A certain deliberateness characterized his attitude
BTS This institution took the place of the militia which had proved impracticable under the new regime
BTS A scamper across the pasture a jackrabbit rising suddenly under the horse's feet a violent sheer a stumble a fall to earth and a broken leg for the master was the cause of it
BTS I was for putting my arm around her as when in the midst of the seal herd
BTS D'ye wonder he's well named
BTS No matter what destruction was wreaked in the heart of the city they and their womenkind and children were to escape hurt
BTS Me sir answered Holyoak one of the deep-water sailors a slight tremor in his voice
BTS Men felt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron and the odds went down to two to one
BTS The blow which he had received before going overboard had laid his scalp open several inches
BTS For ten minutes I had watched her talking earnestly with the engineer and now with a sign for silence I drew her out of earshot of the helmsman
BTS It is inconceivable that any sane man can radically disagree with one's most sane conclusions
BTS The courts were in the hands of their enemies
BTS It was not that he had caught me in my solicitude but that I had caught myself and in his presence
BTS '  In those days groups of predatory individuals controlled all the means of transportation and for the use of same levied toll upon the public
BTS And a greater because modern she added
BTS You was never like this before
BTS Sometimes in the traces when jerked by a sudden stoppage of the sled or by straining to start it he would cry out with pain
BTS I think you can now fire your father's legs back into the grave to him
BTS Maud's eyes were shining with anticipation as they followed me
BTS the quality that set apart his species from all other species
BTS This puzzled me
BTS The other seemed to be judging him in a non-committal sort of way
BTS Billee's one fault was his excessive good nature while Joe was the very opposite sour and introspective with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye
BTS Besides you have sinned
BTS What could we do
BTS Once and twice he sleepily brushed his nose with his paw
BTS We might fail to carry out our decrees against our enemies such as the Pococks for instance
BTS Then he tried to be more dignified and the master laughed harder than before
BTS Ernest abruptly changed front
BTS We sprang together for the ladder but I raced past her to the deck
BTS For 'tis in the bones iv me I know that come this time next year I'll be gazin' in the old mother's eyes weary with watchin' iv the sea for the five sons she gave to it
BTS Heave in
BTS The hiding-place was mine
BTS And so it came that White Fang learned that the right to punish was something the gods reserved for themselves and denied to the lesser creatures under them
BTS On the instant my flesh was creeping and crawling from the harsh contact
BTS In fact though this strength pervaded every action of his it seemed but the advertisement of a greater strength that lurked within that lay dormant and no more than stirred from time to time but which might arouse at any moment terrible and compelling like the rage of a lion or the wrath of a storm
BTS But he had not yet grown compact
BTS And Jackson had a wife and two children dependent on him
BTS Evidently the strange steamboat had lowered its boats
BTS I took off my shoes when I gained the forecastle head and went noiselessly aft in my stocking feet
BTS Could it be that our eyes were speaking beyond the will of our speech
BTS I left Mr
BTS As I passed him I shot a keen look at his face
BTS I've given you warning Cooky Wolf Larsen said and now you've got to take your medicine
BTS A typical illustration of the internecine strife that permeated all society
BTS On the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level country where were great stretches of forest and many streams and through these great stretches they ran steadily hour after hour the sun rising higher and the day growing warmer
BTS It remained to him a white wall of light
BTS He wanted not to escape a clubbing but to have the leadership
BTS I'm so sorry she said
BTS Henry judged his case to be hopeless
BTS It is a case of life and death for us of the middle class
BTS It will be a deduction
BTS Not that
BTS He spasmodically ripped and tore with his fangs for a space
BTS for the eyes dimly intelligent were looking at me and seeing me
BTS They wasted their time sending us here
BTS All the great men ever did was to know it when it came to them
BTS He backed away bewildered and puzzled
BTS I looked at him inquiringly
BTS You know me for what I am my worth in the world by your standard
BTS This phenomenon fascinated me for a time while my senses were coming back to me
BTS At the current price of skins in the London market and based on a fair estimate of what the afternoon's catch would have been had not the Macedonia hogged it the Ghost has lost about fifteen hundred dollars' worth of skins
BTS It would never do he said decisively
BTS And as with California so elsewhere
BTS For Johnson and Leach the travail of existence had ceased
BTS Johnson has been guilty of speaking his mind too freely and has collided two or three times with Wolf Larsen over the pronunciation of his name
BTS There was something heroic about this gently-bred woman enduring our terrible hardship and with her pittance of strength bending to the tasks of a peasant woman
BTS To you
BTS Its jaws were pried apart to their greatest extension and a stout stake sharpened at both ends was so inserted that when the pries were removed the spread jaws were fixed upon it
BTS But if they were all mildness toward her they were all fierceness toward one another
BTS Ernest laughed harshly and savagely when he had gained the street
BTS I was mistaken when I said that I was in the good graces of all
BTS It was this renewal of peace that brought about the alliance between Germany and the United States
BTS I asked him
BTS declared unconstitutional the law prohibiting minors and women from working in factories after nine o'clock at night the ground taken being that such a law was class legislation
BTS Like the smile the shrug was twisted
BTS I looked
BTS Wickson as much as told me so
BTS pooh
BTS Thank you Mr
BTS Calvin answered
BTS More of this white stuff was falling through the air
BTS On such occasions his elbows were on his knees his hands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms
BTS It was borne in upon him that he must let his master's dogs alone
BTS But our captain is a strange man and I beg of you to be prepared for anything understand
BTS Half a mile of it had disappeared--where or how I never learned
BTS Countless heads were broken and there were many killed
BTS No one accepted his offer and he went on In which event I'll lay ten to one there's trouble breezing up
BTS O hero
BTS When I had last seen him he had looked a sick man
BTS I had not thought my victory was so far-reaching and complete but I resolved to let go nothing I had gained
BTS and a great rotund New York member began shouting Anarchist
BTS that he was thrilled and upborne with knowledge that one of the great moments of living when the tide of life surges up in flood was upon him
BTS I was asked
BTS I turned scornfully away and went aft
BTS He was never in the way never extravagant nor foolish in the expression of his love
BTS In fact his conduct approached that of a bully and he was given to swaggering up and down before Spitz's very nose
BTS He followed him about at his work watched him while he ate saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning
BTS Because we are so made I guess
BTS And such condemnation
BTS We have no way of learning
BTS He was in evening dress and what of his broad shoulders and kingly head he looked magnificent
BTS It's all right
BTS Conventional or habitual values meant nothing to him
BTS He knew clearly what was to be done and this he did by promptly eating the ptarmigan
BTS And never had hot coffee tasted so good
BTS The poor farmers Ernest once laughed savagely
BTS Makin' free to spit out what's in me Matt said one day I beg to state that you was a wise guy all right when you paid the price you did for that dog
BTS I had slept seven hours
BTS Across the street and half a block down high up in a building I could see heads peering out
BTS Half a ton
BTS I ought to make the tackle fast at the point of balance
BTS He had received another stroke
BTS As I sat in my bunk examining it the six hunters were all in the steerage smoking and talking in loud voices Henderson took a passing glance at it
BTS Also the dogs were fed
BTS When I aroused it was as after centuries of time
BTS Where is he
BTS and to his credit he gave more than he received
BTS The stout gentleman is stuffing the magazine into his overcoat pocket and looking on curiously
BTS At present however she said after another slight pause I earn about eighteen hundred dollars a year
BTS Plum tuckered out that's what's the matter
BTS My feet were out from under me and I was turning over and over and being swept along I knew not where
BTS Then he fought his teeth flashing in a snap that sank them into the hand
BTS They never see the blessed sunshine
BTS All were quiet and subdued and leave-taking was done with low voices
BTS Because he trusted his life to solid bread and butter and roast beef
BTS but Maud advanced the theory to prepare me for disappointment I do believe if disappointment were to come that we had discovered an unknown rookery
BTS He watched them closely as they shouldered the luggage and were led off down the hill by Matt who carried the bedding and the grip
BTS They elevated the end of the hatch-cover with pitiful haste and like a dog flung overside the dead man slid feet first into the sea
BTS Then in the first dog-watch trouble came to a head in the forecastle
BTS With a snarl she sprang upon One Ear
BTS There is no discussion Ernest answered
BTS and before we left her the Bishop had built the fire while I had peeled the potatoes and put them on to boil
BTS There are other plans afoot was the retort
BTS Contented sounds saluted his ear and when he heard the angry voice of a woman he knew it to be the anger that proceeds from a full stomach
BTS He was too discreet and cautious a man to incur Wolf Larsen's anger at a time when that anger could be expressed in terms stronger than words
BTS No man in the industrial machine is a free-will agent except the large capitalist and he isn't if you'll pardon the Irishism
BTS The resulting tangle was even worse but Buck took good care to keep the traces clear thereafter
BTS Nine feet
BTS It is a picture and I can see it now the jagged edges of the hole in the side of the cabin through which the grey fog swirled and eddied
BTS Once 'e got 'is 'and on the knife an' tried to 'old it
BTS I'll have the law on you
BTS This unexpected addition to his worriments in finding places for the progeny of his petroleum and their progeny and their progeny's progeny was too much for the equanimity of a man without a digestion
BTS Each time he performed the journey with greater swagger but he never brought more than a few dollars at a time
BTS With a roar that was almost lionlike in its ferocity he again hurled himself at the man
BTS I suggested
BTS The suddenness of his outburst startled and frightened me
BTS You are like a frigate bird swooping down upon the boobies and robbing them of the fish they have caught
BTS It was on the verge of my tongue to ask if he were going to take the castaways into Yokohama
BTS White Fang in the very nature of him could never know anything about gods
BTS Do you know you are deaf in the right ear
BTS He appeared the same physically as when last I saw him but he was gloomy and silent
BTS It is true we are even now building still more wonderful wonder cities but the wonder cities of the oligarchs endure and I write these lines in Ardis one of the most wonderful of them all
BTS I was never brave till I knew you
BTS At the front were the strongest
BTS The effect on one's sensibilities was weird depressing
BTS One of the machines swerved wildly at high speed half a block down and the next moment already left well behind it the pavement was torn into a great hole by a bursting bomb
BTS Air-holes formed fissures sprang and spread apart while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into the river
BTS Men preyed upon one another like ravening wolves
BTS Ernest was embarrassed and awkward
BTS D'you remember Dallas the superintendent
BTS While my hope and faith in human life still survived Wolf Larsen's destructive criticism he had nevertheless been a cause of change in minor matters
BTS Let us wait
BTS The man who had spoken came over to her
BTS the seas would swamp it the moment it fell into the trough
BTS The Constitution especially states that the militia cannot be sent out of the country
BTS Life was complex in the Santa Clara Valley after the simplicities of the Northland
BTS They would never get another rope around his neck
BTS Show the fallacy Colonel Van Gilbert
BTS I passed my hand over the horny projections and my teeth went on edge once more from the horrible rasping sensation produced
BTS And all of them are thralls by virtue of the fact that the trusts already own or control which is the same thing only better--own and control all the means of marketing the crops such as cold storage railroads elevators and steamship lines
BTS Also the house was built against the perpendicular wall
BTS His mind seemed preoccupied and there were strange pauses in his conversation abrupt changes of topic and an inconsecutiveness that was bewildering
BTS When at last he succeeded in rolling clear of her he crawled to his feet badly dishevelled hurt both in body and in spirit
BTS But when away from his god the pain and the unrest returned
BTS His hands shook his whole body quivered and shrank away from the picture he had conjured
BTS I shall never be able to take pleasure in pretty gowns again I added
BTS Then he took the trail the lightened sled bounding along behind the willing dogs
BTS All my old-time marvel at life returned to me at sight of this splendid incarnation of it and Wolf Larsen's cold explanation of life and its meaning was truly ridiculous and laughable
BTS I wondered what Wolf Larsen could get from it and he read aloud to me from Ecclesiastes
BTS A gloomy breakfast was eaten and the four remaining dogs were harnessed to the sled
BTS Next the favored unions withdrew from the international organizations and broke off all affiliations
BTS Besides I was myself aware of hurt at thought of this man whom I had tried to kill dying alone with his fellow-creatures so near
BTS Dazed suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue with the life half throttled out of him Buck attempted to face his tormentors
BTS CHAPTER IX THE MATHEMATICS OF A DREAM In the midst of the consternation his revelation had produced Ernest began again to speak
BTS But that men should wreak their anger on others by the bruising of the flesh and the letting of blood was something strangely and fearfully new to me
BTS As the days went by the evolution of like into love was accelerated
BTS Again Hal's whip fell upon the dogs
BTS Cooky's pickings
BTS Of course this was because I did not concern myself with charity
BTS Possibly this appearance was due to the weariness of the slender neck unable properly to support so great a burden
BTS the lynx might have been frozen to marble
BTS She let her legs go limp like a spoiled child and sat down on the trail
BTS and never in his long life had porcupine served him for a meal
BTS It should never occur again
BTS I was trading
BTS He was manifestly distressed by my coming
BTS she asked
BTS I fell in the sand with her and when I had recovered contented myself with putting my hands under her shoulders and dragging her up the beach to the hut
BTS And then on the crowded sidewalks there were persons innumerable whose attention he attracted
BTS So fresh was it that he knew it immediately for what it was
BTS I agree with all that you have said
BTS When I do not think of what is to come I think of what has been and is no more--my Eagle beating with tireless wings the void soaring toward what was ever his sun the flaming ideal of human freedom
BTS and now and again as we drew closer we could see the bullets zip-zipping from wave to wave
BTS My hat was gone
BTS This time there was no dissent
BTS I knew nothing of the minutiae of ropes and rigging of the trimming and setting of sails
BTS I felt myself a ghost what of my invisibility
BTS the railroad would have had to assume all the risk which you so obligingly assumed for it
BTS but it was this same way that White Fang knew it
BTS What is the matter
BTS The throat-rumble arose in the great room and man nodded to man with indorsement and certitude
BTS You are as much mercenaries sincere mercenaries I grant as were the men of the Swiss Guard
BTS It was not that kind of a club
BTS The day had been long and arduous and he slept soundly and comfortably though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams
BTS Purpose
BTS Why not give them a change of treatment
BTS and to give him rest--just rest--and easement and forgetfulness for a tender space
BTS And the next moment I was aware that the thought was a treason against truth and Ernest rose before me transfigured the apostle of truth with shining brows and the fearlessness of one of Gods own angels battling for the truth and the right and battling for the succor of the poor and lonely and oppressed
BTS His master rarely fed him
BTS And so it was that she had commanded
BTS I returned with the articles in time to hear the Cockney hinting broadly that there was a mystery about him that he might be a gentleman's son gone wrong or something or other
BTS What is the result
BTS Yes that was what kept the profits down
BTS He had told nobody that he was going away
BTS and you are crying to live here and now not hereafter
BTS I asked
BTS Francois unfastened Sol-leks's traces and put him back in his old place
BTS That winter at Dawson Buck performed another exploit not so heroic perhaps but one that put his name many notches higher on the totem-pole of Alaskan fame
BTS From either side we could hear the rattle and roar of war while the automobile picked its way through smoking ruins and tottering walls
BTS I'll run down an' tyke a look over my kit if you've no objections sir to wearin' my things
BTS Further he had no thousand dollars
BTS His favourite way of ignoring her was to lie down with his head on his fore-paws and pretend sleep
BTS This is not braggadocio on the part of Avis Everhard
BTS He saw no human face spoke to no human thing
BTS An' he was no fool dog neither Henry added
BTS I
BTS We had not changed much from primitive man despite the war automobiles that were sliding by
BTS All hands tail on
BTS In the first place he was very suspicious of them
BTS Come on you coward
BTS Cold and cheerless the wind beating on our faces the white seas roaring by we struggled through the day
BTS I shall make certain statements and if you disagree with them speak up
BTS And we all of us will make new and more wonderful machines
BTS and then to me Mr
BTS It was inevitable that much of the mire and slime should cling and be not easily shaken off
BTS And still it was not a bad night I mused nothing to the nights I had been through on the Ghost
BTS He was shot by one of our lookouts at the cave-refuge at Carmel through failure on his part to remember the secret signals
BTS The test the test Dr
BTS The bull-dog was bleeding back of one ear from a rip in his thick neck
BTS Scott cried desperately at the crowd
BTS and there are two thicker volumes the essays which you will pardon my saying and I know not which is flattered more fully equal your verse
BTS An' didn't they have words or a ruction of some kind
BTS Who threw the bomb we do not know but the one thing we are absolutely sure of is that we did not throw it
BTS But unlike Pervaise the confession of Romaines was made public in his own time
BTS Death Larsen is in command of the only sealing steamer in the fleet the Macedonia which carries fourteen boats whereas the rest of the schooners carry only six
BTS His body pitched out and down but in some way he managed to save himself with his legs
BTS Once he got up and walked over to the trough for a drink of water
BTS That's a good sign
BTS I placed my finger on my lips for silence and entered Wolf Larsen's room
BTS Without shame I confess that it was I who turned and footed it
BTS He measured the distance away to the fog-bank and for an instant paused to feel the weight of the wind on his cheek
BTS From there he gained the roof of a chicken-house passed over the ridgepole and dropped to the ground inside
BTS In both countries the socialists came out in bold declaration against the war and threatened the general strike
BTS CHAPTER I MY EAGLE The soft summer wind stirs the redwoods and Wild-Water ripples sweet cadences over its mossy stones
BTS Judgin' by your actions one'd think you didn't know your own mind
BTS Ain't got all the way in yet
BTS Has the Church protested
BTS Only you stick to your trade and I'll stick to mine
BTS Eighty-one
BTS In the end they fell back on a woman one of our comrades and none other than Anna Roylston
BTS A dozen times he charged and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down
BTS It was the custom he said to send reporters to all the socialist meetings for the express purpose of misreporting and distorting what was said in order to frighten the middle class away from any possible affiliation with the proletariat
BTS The lust to kill was on him
BTS More freely because it costs you nothing
BTS One kiss dear love I whispered
BTS He was bewildered by the tremendous and endless rush and movement of things
BTS CHAPTER VI THE FAMINE The spring of the year was at hand when Grey Beaver finished his long journey
BTS To quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do
BTS It looks only reproachful
BTS It was delightful
BTS It was their belief that if ever they weakened the great beast would ingulf them and everything of beauty and wonder and joy and good in its cavernous and slime-dripping maw
BTS He was very nervous as he sat on the platform and I could see the high tension he was under
BTS Gales we encountered now and again for it was a raw and stormy region and in the middle of June a typhoon most memorable to me and most important because of the changes wrought through it upon my future
BTS That's temptation
BTS Thrice he tried to knock him over then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg
BTS I'm going to give that brother of mine a taste of his own medicine
BTS I have been working on it for weeks and I cannot make sure
BTS An' I doubt me if there's a man in the mills that'd put out a hand to drag me from drownin'
BTS but let him become bored or let him have one of his black moods come upon him and at once I am relegated from cabin table to galley while at the same time I am fortunate to escape with my life and a whole body
BTS It was the same when he challenged the hawk down out of the sky
BTS He knew an overpowering desire for the protection and companionship of man
BTS Kind-hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered belongings
BTS I gat me men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and that of all sorts
BTS There were only three the jib foresail and mainsail
BTS nor had Hans or Pete
BTS you're mate just the same
BTS They still maintained their labor organization and this gave them strength in the political struggle that was on
BTS Further letting drop the volume during a lurch of the ship a sheet of paper fell out
BTS Both have grown very fat
BTS The young leader snarled terribly but his snarl broke midmost into a tickling cough
BTS He was not used to the simple and direct method of controversy
BTS So Collie took advantage of her sex to pick upon White Fang and maltreat him
BTS he cried
BTS He had learned to get along without her
BTS Good God
BTS Wolf Larsen went amidships and took the coil of the throat-halyards from its pin
BTS He carries the lives of hundreds of us in his hands and I think he is a traitor
BTS There was something so imperative and masterful about him that I was quite beside myself rattled as Furuseth would have termed it like a quaking child before a stern school-master
BTS Truly Ernest had shaken them when he stretched out his hands for their moneybags his hands that had appeared in their eyes as the hands of the fifteen hundred thousand revolutionists
BTS His head was all right again he said and so without further parley I left him
BTS Dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled where the going was easy but continued to flounder alongside in the soft snow where the going was most difficult till exhausted
BTS It ended with Johnson flinging off Louis's detaining arm and starting forward
BTS The shark a sixteen-footer was hoisted up against the main-rigging
BTS White Fang's natural impulse was to eat it
BTS and in that moment having stepped forward quite close to him I received my first impression of the man himself of the man as apart from his body and from the torrent of blasphemy I had heard him spew forth
BTS For what purpose do you think I did it
BTS After the guests had gone father threw himself into a chair and gave vent to roars of Gargantuan laughter
BTS She is still asleep I answered
BTS Nothing really happened then but everything was explained
BTS But he circled just beyond the range of the club snarling with bitterness and rage
BTS In the midst of it the Kanaka roused
BTS I shall always love it
BTS Then he would seize brands from the fire and hurl them into the pack
BTS I was in some building that was locked in combat with some other building
BTS No more long-winded calculations
BTS I shook my head
BTS The big eat the little that they may continue to move the strong eat the weak that they may retain their strength
BTS CHAPTER III THE GREY CUB He was different from his brothers and sisters
BTS And there I agree with you was Ernest's rejoinder
BTS Mercedes looked at them imploringly untold repugnance at sight of pain written in her pretty face
BTS Six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty terrible miles
BTS Not a train ran not a telegraphic message went over the wires for the telegraphers and railroad men had ceased work along with the rest of the population
BTS If you think I'm a thief just keep it to yerself or you'll find 'ow bloody well mistyken you are
BTS You want to come aboard eh
BTS I don't count
BTS He was splendidly muscled a heavy man and though he strode with the certitude and directness of the physical man there was nothing heavy about his stride
BTS and Anarchist
BTS But what he had expected was nothing to what he realised
BTS Trotting in opposite directions along the base of a high bluff they rounded a corner of rock and found themselves face to face
BTS Next by means of the shears I hoisted the main boom on board
BTS Really Hump he is living deep and high
BTS They were permitted to carry weapons and the authorities aided them in every way
BTS Then you are an individualist a materialist and logically a hedonist
BTS Want to see it work
BTS But with him dead there was time and space in which to prepare to do other things
BTS but the size and fierce aspect of the intruder did not deter him
BTS Concentration is perfect
BTS And it was disembodied
BTS There will be more shooting I am afraid than even I dream of
BTS She rested her hand appealingly on mine and sent my pulse fluttering
BTS The face with large features and strong lines of the square order yet well filled out was apparently massive at first sight
BTS With the overthrow of Lip-lip White Fang could have become leader of the pack
BTS sir what kind of a craft is this
BTS Three-quarters of it went to the Trust
BTS There was reason for it and none knew it better than she
BTS Leach because he had beaten himself out in the vain struggle and was exhausted
BTS It is the capitalist class that pays you that feeds you that puts the very clothes on your backs that you are wearing to-night
BTS Then he turned and trotted back to Grey Beaver's camp
BTS She was lying on the pavement in a pool of blood
BTS The other and spiritual side of their natures has been dwarfed atrophied in fact
BTS I may be taken off by some passing vessel perhaps she suggested
BTS He'll never stand the climate
BTS I was well-nigh choking and my eyes were certainly fiery
BTS He has
BTS But he never forgot himself
BTS Your wife and children
BTS Kowalt amended
BTS The house in which I live cost a hundred thousand dollars and its furnishings books and works of art cost as much more
BTS Wolf Larsen ordered
BTS And Mr
BTS That is the battle alignment
BTS In high glee father described the incident to us that evening
BTS Couldn't make yourself scarce too quick with several gentlemen you may have heard of looking for you
BTS Labor is dreadfully underpaid
BTS Over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm
BTS Grand
BTS Nothing
BTS A circle of the gleaming eyes had drawn about their camp
BTS Our points of view and outlook on life at least were very alike
BTS and steady itself with slight oscillations
BTS The word went up and down the valley and men saw to it that their dogs did not molest the Fighting Wolf
BTS And after several such adventures he left the walls alone
BTS but he was the only unperturbed man aboard
BTS You are sincere
BTS They invariably paid rent and considering the value of such houses enormous rent to the landlords
BTS All right Ernest said
BTS Of course we will win but I shudder to think of it
BTS But the she-wolf was very weak and sick
BTS Thus do we poor humans attain our ends striving through carnage and destruction to bring lasting peace and happiness upon the earth
BTS God knows I don't want to spend my last days in an insane asylum
BTS One of our own comrades who for years had successfully maintained himself in a clerical position in the local bureau of the secret service of the Iron Heel had fallen under the ban of the 'Frisco Reds and was being tried
BTS And does it not also control copper to say nothing of running a smelter trust as a little side enterprise
BTS Thus throughout the organization of the Oligarchy our own organization weblike and spidery was insinuating itself
BTS They have only to see us
BTS The sooner you get accustomed to it the better he said
BTS And as condition in his eyes had the seeming of form so he entered into what had been wall to him and bathed in the substance that composed it
BTS Yet they were more fortunate than the Grangers who captured a dozen state governments and who in the spring were not permitted to take possession of the captured offices
BTS Wolf 'tis what he is
BTS In the violence and turbulence of such disagreements much property was destroyed and many lives lost
BTS Mercy
BTS The five boats went over the side with a rush spread out like the ribs of a fan and set a northerly course as on the preceding afternoon for us to follow
BTS He came in among them panting covered with dust
BTS What of the thin and rotten ice he had felt under his feet all day it seemed that he sensed disaster close at hand out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying to drive him
BTS Life
BTS He had the wheel at the time and I went forward to my hospital in the forecastle where lay the two crippled men Nilson and Thomas Mugridge
BTS This word arthurization has long puzzled the etymologists but its derivation I hope is now made clear

BTS Though the cook had a cubby-hole of a state-room opening off from the cabin in the cabin itself he had never dared to linger or to be seen and he flitted to and fro once or twice a day a timid spectre
BTS The latter were rarely taken in the boats for a seal shot at long range with a rifle invariably sank before a boat could reach it
BTS At first the surge back upon us was crushing but as the killing continued the pressure was eased
BTS The effect was to ameliorate the too savage conditions of the fang-and-claw social struggle
BTS But he was not asleep
BTS Instead the crowd began sarcastically to cheer him on and showered him with facetious advice
BTS and Buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to rest
BTS Dawn caught us on the northern brow and in the gray light we dropped down through chaparral into redwood canyons deep and warm with the breath of passing summer
BTS The sea had turned a dull leaden grey and grown rougher and was now tossing foaming whitecaps to the sky

BTS For he knew that there floating in the blue above him was meat the meat his stomach yearned after so insistently
BTS Three times he struggled to his feet striving to gain the galley and each time was knocked down
BTS And the regular troops had cause
BTS This necessitated my climbing the shears which I did twice before I finished guying it fore and aft and to either side
BTS However in the world could I manage without a tent
BTS Here is night and the wind blowing us off the land
BTS And two days later when he returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the spoil he scattered them like chaff

BTS Ghent has taught the oligarchs how to do it Ernest said
BTS A mad rush of anger sent him leaping in amongst the combatants
BTS Fully half their grub supply was gone
BTS Still hundreds of miles from their goal nevertheless many of them had been on the way for a year and the least any of them had travelled to get that far was five thousand miles while some had come from the other side of the world
BTS My hands were full with the flying-jib jib and staysail
BTS But blow followed blow with bewildering rapidity
BTS To all of which Ernest would shake his head and say How many rifles have you got
BTS I don't understand
BTS I asked
BTS In all this the farmers are without power
BTS It advertised his callowness a callowness sheer and unutterable
BTS The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed
BTS They were grab-sharing with a vengeance
BTS It was a neater job
BTS Then the gag swung to the side with an abrupt swiftness the great sail boomed like a cannon and the three rows of reef-points slatted against the canvas like a volley of rifles
BTS Understand
BTS Your hand is clutching my arm lightly it feels as a butterfly resting there
BTS He pointed out of the window
BTS It is a saying of the country that an Outside dog starves to death on the ration of the husky so the six Outside dogs under Buck could do no less than die on half the ration of the husky
BTS Another night Dub and Joe fought Spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved
BTS Were they in the tent
BTS I breathed more freely
BTS But when he was thus separated from his fellows two or three of the younger bulls would charge back upon Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd
BTS They were running along a narrow alley flanked on either side by a growth of young spruce
BTS yet it was a greater delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces
BTS Henry laughed defiantly
BTS Seems to me Henry they're stayin' remarkable close to camp Bill commented
BTS Now you've struck it Ernest said
BTS You do not like me
BTS Not that he was to be praised for it
BTS He'll bite
BTS He had been monstrously treated
BTS He sprang into the water and swam after it deaf to the sharp cries of Grey Beaver to return
BTS He was stronger than I that was all
BTS Slip it was my answer
BTS I remembered Wolf Larsen's caution
BTS It was fifty-two years in the building during which time a permanent army of half a million serfs was employed
BTS A poor substitute for food was this hide just as it had been stripped from the starved horses of the cattlemen six months back
BTS It was as if some strong anxiety had wasted it
BTS Generation by generation down all the generations had this fear of the Wild been stamped into their natures
BTS I am all right now she said looking up at me gratefully
BTS In ways subtler than they knew they betrayed their intentions to the wolf-dog that haunted the cabin-stoop and that though he never came inside the cabin knew what went on inside their brains
BTS This factory takes leather and makes it into shoes
BTS Why don't you change the basis of your coinage then
BTS He did not change his position either but continued to gaze down with a great curiosity

BTS In 1914 A
BTS It was necessary for us to keep an eye on friend as well as foe and this group of madmen was not too unimportant to escape our surveillance
BTS And with every rock he struck he yelped
BTS The big bull was beset on every side
BTS There was something about the slope of the shoulders and the fringe of silver hair between coat collar and slouch hat that aroused vague memories
BTS And you are mad cosmos-makers
BTS He nodded then added Or he wouldn't be keepin' up such a clip
BTS He turned brusquely away from us and began to question the new men
BTS And still remains the balance
BTS Much more he said that would take too long to write but I shall never forget how he described the life among the revolutionists
BTS In short they alone by their unremitting toil and sacrifice stood between weak humanity and the all-devouring beast
BTS Not only had we resigned ourselves to the bitter winter but we were prepared for it
BTS How'll he know which was which
BTS In their presence Mit-sah would give him meat and would give it to him only
BTS Or tell me Doctor do you have no apprehension in an earthquake that that incorporeal body of yours will be hit by an immaterial brick
BTS He was a killer
BTS And outside he went like a king with all Sierra Vista about him and tending on him
BTS Mugridge grinned insinuatingly in my face as I shoved him out and ordered him back to his galley work
BTS I reached quick and the belt wasn't all the way off
BTS Then White Fang struck
BTS One Eye caught sight of a dim movement of white in the midst of the white
BTS Though he lay down in the entrance and slept his sleep was fitful
BTS He alone endured and prospered matching the husky in strength savagery and cunning
BTS Each of you dwells in a cosmos of his own making created out of his own fancies and desires
BTS He never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush
BTS There was no question about it no discussion
BTS Four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small high-walled back yard
BTS He could fight
BTS Then it is an honest face for it looks what I feel
BTS Be a bad dog and I'll whale the stuffin' outa you

BTS the Bishop queried with alarm
BTS His carriage was one of mingled triumph and caution
BTS They had no economic nor political souls of their own
BTS That is cheap
BTS Nay the time came when I took joy in the run of the masthead and in the clinging on by my legs at that precarious height while I swept the sea with glasses in search of the boats
BTS Next to obtain was a stock of ammunition an easy matter though I had to enter the steerage companion-way to do it
BTS Master of the steamship Macedonia seal-hunter was the answer
BTS She looked at White Fang who snarled and bristled and glared malevolently
BTS Running behind the carriage in the outskirts of San Jose he encountered certain small boys who made a practice of flinging stones at him
BTS History was making fast
BTS and if I have to I'll do it under oath on the witness stand
BTS My words had been decisive
BTS Then all the boys attacked Mit-sah
BTS This was part of the attitude he chose to adopt toward me
BTS What were your last observations
BTS Let's go back

BTS When it comes to a knowledge of the law of how best to evade the law or make new law for the benefit of thieving corporations I am down in the dirt at your feet
BTS We hove to and ran away hove to and ran away and ever astern the struggling patch of sail tossed skyward and fell into the rushing valleys
BTS Oofty-Oofty cried his keen eyes reading its number in the one second when it lifted clear of the foam and upside down
BTS At eleven o'clock I was no farther along
BTS Johnson and Leach were bullied and beaten as much as ever and they looked for their lives to end with the end of the hunting season
BTS For it is my world my gorgeous world The world of my dearest woes From the first faint cry of the newborn To the rack of the woman's throes
BTS Was it not liable to go to pieces at any moment
BTS It was a wistfulness bred of hunger as cruel as its own fangs as merciless as the frost itself
BTS Everything in readiness I made a line fast to the apex of the shears and carried it directly to the windlass
BTS The wind shrieked a wild song through the rigging
BTS The hunting promised to be profitable
BTS With a flaming brand in each hand he sprang to the edge of the fire
BTS There was no need for this caution
BTS It is the winning side
BTS She looked at him merely with a great wistfulness but he knew it to be the wistfulness of an equally great hunger
BTS You have asserted the impossible now let me demonstrate the inevitable
BTS Yes she answered that is what they pay
BTS The door-knob rattled
BTS How hard he toiled and how greatly he suffered I well know
BTS He knew his two brothers and his two sisters very well
BTS This was called electrocution and it was very popular during that period
BTS Faint and dizzy I was vaguely aware of a strong arm around my body under the arms and half-lifting me and dragging me along
BTS He was a master of law
BTS Then a few minutes later having digested his instructions and thoroughly mastered the manoeuvre I would proceed to issue my orders
BTS He had met a townsman a couple of years before in some sailor boarding-house in Chile so that he knew his mother to be still alive
BTS My lips seemed suddenly dry and I moistened them against the need of speech
BTS For me he tore the sham from the face of society and gave me glimpses of reality that were as unpleasant as they were undeniably true
BTS a bloody lie
BTS There was a great row that night
BTS Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down

BTS Once the terror of this giddy sweep overpowered me and for a while I clung on hand and foot weak and trembling unable to search the sea for the missing boats or to behold aught of the sea but that which roared beneath and strove to overwhelm the Ghost
BTS Wolf Larsen shouted springing himself to the rope in advance of the quickest
BTS There was no movement no sound
BTS He snarled softly up at the thing of fear watching keenly the deportment of the hands
BTS As I say he became well quite well and the newspapers and the church people hailed his return with joy
BTS He exhibited them exposing beautiful white teeth in a grin as he did so and explaining that the wounds had come from striking Wolf Larsen in the mouth
BTS The Cockney strove in vain to protect himself from the infuriated boy

BTS She'll be there in five or six hours with this wind
BTS Buck did not comprehend that silent intentness nor the eager way with which they were licking their chops
BTS He seemed to recover himself for a lucid gleam came into his eyes and he relaxed his hold with a short laugh that was more like a growl
BTS What'd I want to kick 'm for
BTS He accounted for the existence of the million and a half of revolutionists in the United States by charging the capitalist class with having mismanaged society
BTS But I no longer despaired in the old way

BTS He must have been jumped upon
BTS Winter is almost here
BTS I found a light kedge anchor in the fore-hold where such things were kept
BTS He feigned at first and in doing so brought it on
BTS Successful as he was with squirrels there was one difficulty that prevented him from living and growing fat on them
BTS Imbecile
BTS We shivered miserably throughout the night
BTS The cursing policeman alongside of me also ran and Hartman and I ran too we knew not why obsessed with the same blind terror to get away from that particular spot
BTS but Ernest opened his eyes looked at me and waved them aside
BTS Now we shall become real proletarians father said when we were driven from our home
BTS Van Weyden
BTS The smoke was still miles astern but overhauling us rapidly when we lowered our boats
BTS In the United States to-day there are fifteen million people living in poverty
BTS You won't chance it
BTS The throat-halyards which I had rigged were cut across through every part
BTS The hand was jerked back and the teeth came together emptily with a sharp click
BTS Sometimes this stroke was successful and a stricken dog rolled in the dirt to be pounced upon and torn to pieces by the pack of Indian dogs that waited
BTS What is it
BTS Love alone is stronger than sin--stronger than death
BTS He ran awkwardly but he ran well
BTS We were well dressed and that was enough
BTS and even then they were lying down at a distance apparently oblivious of his existence
BTS I knew also that weapons would not come in amiss and I re-entered Wolf Larsen's state-room to get his rifle and shot-gun
BTS We were sheltered under the very aegis of one of the minor oligarchs
BTS Pullman--the designation of the more luxurious railway cars of the period and so named from the inventor
BTS She has broken down at last I thought
BTS So it would seem
BTS Ah he remarked with a wry pucker of his mouth I see you still believe in such things as right and wrong
BTS His mate looked at him anxiously
BTS In fact the few words we spoke could hardly be called a conversation
BTS She no longer considered the dogs and because she was sore and tired she persisted in riding on the sled
BTS I too was afraid and what of my discovery of how much she meant to me my mind was in a turmoil
BTS For several minutes this mid-air battle continued then died out
BTS Many other similar disconcerting omissions will be noticed in the Manuscript
BTS In fact I am afraid I do not understand politics
BTS And don't you think your miserable life worth the price
BTS So that was the way they did it eh
BTS It's a dark business from the way you hide it Ernest said with growing anger
BTS But the world now seemed changed
BTS What form it will take I can't even guess
BTS He was to know fear many times in his dealing with man
BTS Of all places the Club gathered that night at the Pertonwaithe house
BTS The difference worked in my status brought about a corresponding difference in treatment from him
BTS A few of the boldest and wisest forsook the fires of the gods which had now become a shambles and fled into the forest where in the end they starved to death or were eaten by wolves
BTS Nor did he notice the open trap
BTS the man asked after the customary Ay ay sir
BTS But this day as I noted them pacing up and down I saw that it was she who terminated the walk
BTS Her joy at finding him seemed even greater than his joy at being found
BTS You do not understand the combination that has been effected
BTS If the situation is unpleasing you compromise with your conscience when you make yourself a party to it
BTS In reality he was attempting to warn me to throw my ashes over the lee side
BTS I felt rather timid and apprehensive for she had come to search Humphrey Van Weyden's soul and Humphrey Van Weyden had nothing of which to be particularly proud since his advent on the Ghost
BTS He was voicing an utter woe his cry bursting upward in great heart-breaking rushes dying down into quavering misery and bursting upward again with a rush upon rush of grief
BTS As we had done before so again we sought shelter in an entrance
BTS Life had become cheap and tawdry a beastly and inarticulate thing a soulless stirring of the ooze and slime
BTS My father was a good man Ernest once said to me
BTS And there was no fat about him
BTS He was afraid that Thornton would pass out of his life as Perrault and Francois and the Scotch half-breed had passed out
BTS Pig
BTS It was then that he sent for the Catholic priest Father Peter Durban and to him made confession
BTS I'm agreein' with you was Matt's answer and again his employer was not quite satisfied with him
BTS but do not come down to the working class and serve as false leaders
BTS the empty upholstered seats littered with all the evidences of sudden flight such as packages hand satchels umbrellas and wraps
BTS for there was no telling what Wolf Larsen might do
BTS The door opened and Weedon Scott stepped in
BTS Your body draws itself up in knots like a snake's
BTS Each day grows perceptibly warmer
BTS At home I should undoubtedly have given vent to my anguish
BTS He was astounded at the suddenness of it
BTS It's a lie and you know it
BTS They have been cut with a knife
BTS It was with gratitude that I hailed these signs of a new interest in life though I little dreamed what the outcome would be
BTS They will be compelled to work just as the farmers are compelled to work now for the masters who robbed them of their land
BTS It was necessary that they should be thrown off the track and that I should win to California
BTS We will say labor buys back two billions
BTS A majority of the men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor whereat the odds went up to three to one against Buck
BTS He walked for miles around knolls over ridges and through canyons and finally covered the trail in the running water of a creek-bed
BTS I who even in the most flagrant crimes had denied the justice and righteousness of capital punishment
BTS Under ordinary circumstances after all that I had undergone I should have been fit for bed and a trained nurse
BTS There were reports of numerous wireless stations that had been blown up with heavy rewards offered for the detection of the perpetrators
BTS It would be terrible if he were
BTS The wolf started on toward the place from where the call surely came then returned to him sniffing noses and making actions as though to encourage him
BTS And here's a try at it
BTS Lobby--a peculiar institution for bribing bulldozing and corrupting the legislators who were supposed to represent the people's interests
BTS I stopped the carriage got out and after a few minutes' conversation persuaded two of the public women to get into the brougham with me
BTS It grew larger and so swiftly that for the first time I fully appreciated the speed of our flight
BTS The men ceased talking
BTS All you need is one star in the sky on a dirty night to know instantly where you are
BTS We looked at each other and our hands felt their way and clasped
BTS He's all hunky with the officials
BTS It was a deer-hound rushing upon him
BTS Most of the first month of his life had been passed thus in sleeping
BTS In the morning we had breakfast and were at work by daylight
BTS CHAPTER X My intimacy with Wolf Larsen increases if by intimacy may be denoted those relations which exist between master and man or better yet between king and jester
BTS He seems consuming with the tremendous power that is in him and that seems never to have found adequate expression in works
BTS he asked
BTS Then he lay down with a contented grunt at the master's feet observing all that went on ever ready to spring to his feet and fight for life with the terrors he felt must lurk under the trap-roof of the dwelling
BTS An altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others
BTS And so was recorded the second epitaph in two days
BTS Anyway I'm goin' to sleep
BTS And in return you preach to your employers the brands of metaphysics that are especially acceptable to them
BTS Once he awakened and in an opening in the circle directly in front of him he saw the she-wolf gazing at him
BTS One smash from the club was sufficient to convince him that the white god knew how to handle it and he was too wise to fight the inevitable
BTS all markets were falling
BTS Throw your weight against the gee-pole right and left and break it out
BTS You say something else
BTS She was an apt pupil and soon learned to keep the course to luff in the puffs and to cast off the sheet in an emergency
BTS It was the end of the third day of a fierce storm which had swung around the compass from the south-east to the north-west and which was then blowing directly in upon us
BTS It was patent that he had made a clean and secret sweep of everything before he disappeared
BTS So out of the unpractical idea of profit-sharing arose the practical idea of grab-sharing
BTS First he was evidently a valuable possession of the master's and next he was undemonstrative
BTS Oh he was not technically discharged
BTS I tried to cheer him up but he ignored my effort and suddenly began talking very hurriedly in a low voice as we passed through the station
BTS The dogs worked in single file one behind another hauling on double traces
BTS but still more surprising was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks
BTS He had learned much
BTS I had seen the people of the abyss before gone through its ghettos and thought I knew it
BTS the red-faced man stumping gallantly around on his artificial legs and buckling life-preservers on all comers
BTS She was like a bit of Dresden china and I was continually impressed with what I may call her fragility
BTS At first he snarled and tried to fight
BTS Try to find out and you get a bomb on your head
BTS The student thinks in English and then transmutes into French or reads in French but transmutes into English before he can understand
BTS The suffocation he experienced was like the pang of death
BTS I shall pay you whatever you judge your delay and trouble to be worth
BTS Everywhere it goes begging
BTS And still step by step with long intervals between the mass ascended
BTS He was surprised and looked at them in a puzzled way
BTS A rain of pecks fell on his ill-used nose
BTS I'll finish this rescue all right but I want time time lots of it--and something to eat
BTS He seemed pleased when I nodded my head with the customary Yes sir
BTS I glanced around to see that no one was within hearing distance
BTS And I won't be in no hurry about it
BTS But coal
BTS He looked upon our catastrophe in the light of an adventure
BTS That most exact and convincing of all sciences mathematics is sheerly metaphysical
BTS They're pretty thin
BTS It was possibly a minute before he spoke
BTS The whole fabric of society is a-tremble with them
BTS The men and women who had worked the hand-looms for themselves now went into the factories and worked the machine-looms not for themselves but for the capitalist owners
BTS For the first time I began to divine that something terrible was about to be enacted what I could not imagine
BTS Do as I say and ere long you will find I am right
BTS Seven of your thin little volumes are on my shelves
BTS I'll bet he has no appetite for supper I heard Wolf Larsen's voice which came to me from around the corner of the galley
BTS We rightly contended that any revolt on our part was virtually suicide for the whole Revolution
BTS Well stranger the other drawled irritatingly I don't mind telling you that's something I ain't worked out for myself
BTS I'm busy
BTS I felt like crying aloud as I looked at him Great Bishop
BTS Now the grey cub had lived all his days on a level floor
BTS Though she betrayed it by no outward sign I felt somehow that she was greatly perturbed
BTS Insanity
BTS He had travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage car
BTS It will turn around and blow fair
BTS No sir Well never mind
BTS He began with Mr
BTS The cub's fear of the unknown was an inherited distrust and it had now been strengthened by experience
BTS The very thing
BTS But sometimes straying off to the edge of the woods by himself he gave vent to his grief and cried it out with loud whimperings and wailings
BTS As he pulled and tugged and wrenched he kept exclaiming with every expulsion of breath Beasts
BTS A third time the attempt was made but this time following the advice Hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow
BTS His mind was fresh and plastic and by nature he was very ethical
BTS The small manufacturer is like the farmer
BTS The source of his financial strength lay wholly in the middle class
BTS I did not watch him and it was not until he was back beside me and we were speeding on that he said It was Bishop Morehouse
BTS And still she did not move
BTS At supper I requested the hunters to lower their voices so she was not disturbed
BTS I shall have to arm myself before I dare go on deck with him
BTS Perhaps he is ill very ill
BTS Next morning I sent out for all the papers
BTS He must find meat
BTS I had not been called Sissy Van Weyden all my days without reason and that Sissy Van Weyden should be capable of doing this thing was a revelation to Humphrey Van Weyden who knew not whether to be exultant or ashamed
BTS While I toiled up the fore-shrouds the Ghost slowly paid off
BTS What can be done with it
BTS He'll learn soon enough
BTS Listen to the word will ye
BTS Tell me Ernest demanded what will you do when such a time comes
BTS This ecstasy this forgetfulness of living comes to the artist caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame
BTS At other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between his legs and slept
BTS in 1902 127713
BTS No reference was made on either side to the destruction of the shears
BTS They alone were alive and they sought for other things that were alive in order that they might devour them and continue to live
BTS All of which has set me wondering
BTS I found Jackson the meek and lowly man he had been described
BTS He was asleep on his back and breathing as placidly as a woman
BTS He was the spirit of regnant labor as he stood there his hands outreaching to rend and crush his audience
BTS I was armed with the regular club with which the boat-pullers killed the wounded seals gaffed aboard by the hunters
BTS It was his old fighting trick
BTS But how
BTS No sooner did I get my freedom than my footsteps began to be dogged by the spies of the Iron Heel
BTS The squirrels were in hiding
BTS Which is a cheap thing and without value
BTS It was an expression of the master's disapproval and White Fang's spirit wilted under it
BTS Cawn't even carry a bit of tea aft without losin' it
BTS some one shouted and a guffaw of laughter went up
BTS she demanded
BTS So this was the social philosopher and ex-horseshoer my father had discovered was my thought
BTS Oh that first breath of air as we were dragged out
BTS To destroy Hearst all that was necessary was to take away from him his advertising
BTS I was an interested spectator of events and sometimes swept on by the rush was myself a curious participant
BTS Hal cried Whoa
BTS I learned also that Wolf Larsen was anxious to make the most of the storm which was driving him to the south-west into that portion of the sea where he expected to pick up with the north-east trades
BTS He was evidently in a pessimistic mood
BTS But he only laughed and seemed to enjoy it
BTS They did not seem to know anything these newcomers
BTS I saw nothing
BTS For that matter my percentages are mild
BTS Believe me when I get to throwing bombs I'll do damage
BTS He fired three careful shots
BTS At first the machine bosses charged the master capitalists extortionate tolls for legislation
BTS No one answered for a long time
BTS A carnivorous animal living on a straight meat diet he was in full flower at the high tide of his life overspilling with vigor and virility
BTS And hand in hand with this in all precautionary measures in Chicago the Iron Heel was inconceivably careless
BTS There is a patience of the wild dogged tireless persistent as life itself that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web the snake in its coils the panther in its ambuscade
BTS I had taken my dried clothes down from the galley the night before and the first thing I did was to exchange the cook's garments for them
BTS But it was too late
BTS I looked at him the man who had been hurled down from the topmost pitch of life to be buried alive and be worse than dead
BTS How had it happened
BTS An Englishman by birth a writer of many books on political economy and philosophy and one of the Socialist leaders of the times
BTS In which case the hunter cannot steer and shoot at the same time
BTS for the wolf finding that no harm was intended finally sniffed noses with him
BTS The men who came ashore from the steamers were newcomers
BTS But I noticed also whenever one with a show of fight tried to break past that her eyes glinted and showed bright and she rapped it smartly with her club
BTS They were capable of snapping a man off like a fly from a whip-lash
BTS I sensed this in ways I knew not save that they were my woman's intuitions
BTS He was preeminently cunning and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive
BTS They are not so good as the others but they are very warming
BTS A blow from Three Eagles knocked him backward to the land
BTS Picture it to yourself a man of ordinary stature slender of build and with weak undeveloped muscles who has lived a peaceful placid life and is unused to violence of any sort what could such a man possibly do
BTS In the shoulder he answered
BTS It could only buy back fifty dollars' worth
BTS I was frightened

BTS Look at that
BTS He relighted his cigar and glanced around
BTS and that even the eyes had changed expression and into them were coming watchfulness and measurement and a light none other than of battle
BTS I signed for cabin-boy
BTS He too had risen and he stood facing her where she had paused at the door of her room as he went on Here at least We shall be free
BTS Nevertheless with the exception of the ones that limped the movements of the animals were effortless and tireless
BTS Only those curious times could have given rise to the amazing spectacle of one Farley a notorious commander of strike-breakers who in 1906 swept across the United States in special trains from New York to San Francisco with an army of twenty-five hundred men fully armed and equipped to break a strike of the San Francisco street-car men
BTS It's the fortresses Hartman said
BTS He ceased speaking and his gaze wandered absently past her and became lost in the placid sea
BTS To us he was full of potentiality
BTS Friederich Nietzsche the mad philosopher of the nineteenth century of the Christian Era who caught wild glimpses of truth but who before he was done reasoned himself around the great circle of human thought and off into madness
BTS How did it happen
BTS My body struck and pounded as it was dashed helplessly along and turned over and over and when I could hold my breath no longer I breathed the stinging salt water into my lungs
BTS The inferno was still raging
BTS You Kerfoot go for'ard and see what's become of Cooky
BTS at the best he could know only things that were beyond knowing but the wonder and awe that he had of these man-animals in ways resembled what would be the wonder and awe of man at sight of some celestial creature on a mountain top hurling thunderbolts from either hand at an astonished world
BTS Do you feed yourself
BTS You get used to being hungry
BTS There was mild protest in his pale blue eyes and withal a timid frankness and manliness that quite won me to him
BTS 'Elp
BTS His brows drew in slightly with the mental effort of suitably phrasing thoughts which he had never before put into speech
BTS Twice I saw the hunter let go the steering-oar with one hand reach for his rifle and hesitate
BTS You go to Sunday-school to learn what is right
BTS In the cities of the Mercenaries and of the labor castes similar programmes of disruption were to be carried out
BTS All was quiet on the streets--too quiet
BTS The desire to close had always been mutual
BTS God
BTS Red she-wolf
BTS Big for your age at that with muscles like a horse
BTS He could see the wolves flooding into the big living-room of the fort
BTS Without delight living is a worthless act
BTS The previous evening he had reasoned himself into the blues and I had been waiting momentarily for one of his characteristic outbursts
BTS Built directly in the eyes of the schooner it was of the shape of a triangle along the three sides of which stood the bunks in double-tier twelve of them
BTS The bull-dog's method was to hold what he had and when opportunity favoured to work in for more
BTS These swung back and forth with every roll of the vessel giving rise to a brushing sound as of trees against a roof or wall
BTS At their backs rose a perpendicular wall of rock and Perrault and Francois were compelled to make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake itself
BTS Tell him I want him
BTS Henry grunted and began unlacing his moccasins
BTS They have been faithful to their salt and they have been correspondingly rewarded with ecclesiastical palaces wherein they dwell at peace with the world
BTS Now and again feet stamped overhead
BTS he demanded abruptly
BTS Scott turned his back on him and returned to help the dog-musher who was working over White Fang
BTS It was Philip Wickson though I did not know him at the time
BTS The mob came on slowly
BTS I have not been a professor for the sake of my salary
BTS But as I was without experience and as every detail was an experiment and every successful detail an invention the day was well gone before her shelter was an accomplished fact
BTS Poor driven people of the abyss hunted helots--they lay there as the rabbits in California after a drive
BTS When the canoe touched the shore White Fang lay whimpering and motionless waiting the will of Grey Beaver
BTS For the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason and it was because of his great love for John Thornton that he lost his head
BTS I called upon him in his beautiful home
BTS Do be careful she called after me
BTS The life that is in you cries out that it must live no matter what the cost
BTS But we did not stir and we moved only when he moved
BTS I was without confidence in the future extremely doubtful and yet I felt no underlying fear
BTS I should not have been surprised if the wet black beard had frizzled and curled and flared up in smoke and flame
BTS The papers were filled with tales of violence and blood
BTS Also a great pulse was beating in my brain
BTS In the crew of the fishing boat that conveyed them across San Pablo Bay was a spy
BTS There was Bishop Morehouse
BTS Have you ever paused for a moment to consider our appearance
BTS White Fang gazed at him wistfully
BTS He was fighting tearing at a live thing that was striking at him
BTS Excited by the day-long pursuit of him swayed subconsciously by the insistent iteration on their brains of the sight of him fleeing away mastered by the feeling of mastery enjoyed all day the dogs could not bring themselves to give way to him
BTS He would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss or into the black soil where long grasses grew and snort with joy at the fat earth smells
BTS Then he broke out You make me tired
BTS Without moving and being part of the yeast there would be no hopelessness
BTS One Eye was desperate
BTS As for myself I was oppressed with nightmare
BTS It was impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore
BTS I was not sniffling though my face might well have been drawn and twitching from the pain
BTS Maud still watched from the tent
BTS Human kindness was like a sun shining upon him and he flourished like a flower planted in good soil
BTS A return to the soil forsooth
BTS and the Wild aims always to destroy movement
BTS Owen destroyed competition here in Berkeley when your branch store drove the three small groceries out of business
BTS But he interrupted passionately
BTS He was no fool himself and whatever vengeance he desired to wreak he could wait until he caught White Fang alone
BTS At times it seemed impossible either that I had ever lived a placid peaceful life in a college town or else that I had become a revolutionist inured to scenes of violence and death
BTS For the thick of the fleet had been to the westward of us and the boats scattered far and wide had headed in mad flight for the nearest refuge
BTS The other reached into the holster at his hip drew his revolver and tried to thrust its muzzle between the bull-dog's jaws
BTS He followed with wild leapings in a frenzy to overtake
BTS There seemed a tacit conspiracy against Jackson and I was aware of a thrill of sympathy for the whining lawyer who had ingloriously fought his case
BTS The down-coming winter was harrying them on to the lower levels and it seemed they could never shake off this tireless creature that held them back
BTS His first glance was for Buck over whose limp and apparently lifeless body Nig was setting up a howl while Skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes
BTS Three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair rippling and bristling It led straight toward camp and John Thornton
BTS He was suspicious of them
BTS We know what we're about
BTS Softly now Wolf Larsen warned me in a whisper as he doubled his body into the forecastle scuttle and prepared to descend
BTS But the Cockney had not pursued me
BTS Had Grey Beaver possessed the plummet of affection and love he might have sounded the deeps of White Fang's nature and brought up to the surface all manner of kindly qualities
BTS Nobody had been affected
BTS Trying to scuttle my ship for me
BTS My soul and my stomach revolted at it
BTS Still continued the journey of Grey Beaver
BTS I was too tired to thrash my arms about and warm myself but I found strength time and again to chafe her hands and feet to restore the circulation
BTS We were in a labyrinth of ruin and our progress was slow
BTS What
BTS he went on at once with his perpetual queries
BTS An' so when I saw it run off across the snow I looked in the snow an' saw its tracks
BTS The deep-sea voices of these men rumbling and bellowing in the confined space produced a wild effect
BTS Next morning after breakfast Thomas Mugridge began his whet whet whet
BTS So clearly could one see canon gorge and precipice and the shadows that lie therein that one looked unconsciously for the white surf-line and bellowing caverns where the sea charges on the land
BTS 'I mean something substantial
BTS he demanded for the twentieth time with a helpless shrug of the shoulders
BTS There was no clearness or sanity in them nothing but the terrific rage of a madman
BTS You never had the proletariat Ernest cried
BTS It had been an irresistible attraction before ever his eyes opened and looked upon it
BTS But one lived Timothy and him his father considered dead because he had taken service with the Iron Heel in the Mercenaries
BTS Thank you Ernest said gravely
BTS As by magic forty thousand soldiers of the regular army surrounded the malcontents
BTS The leaders in prison and out were able to discuss and direct the campaign
BTS In the same way he accepted that his father could disappear into walls
BTS '  A noted educator of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries of the Christian Era
BTS He tried it again with the same result
BTS Won't somebody get a knife
BTS Wickson spoke
BTS Calvin work all your nights and days to organize the farmers along with the rest of the middle class into a new political party
BTS I was seized by the consequent panic and went over the side in a surge of bodies
BTS It attracted him as a candle attracts a moth
BTS And he has never philosophized on life I added
BTS You surely do not dream that I'll consider them in dealing with you
BTS I have forgotten to say that the bronze ended with his face
BTS It still rang in my ears and I felt that I should like to hear it again--and to see again that glint of laughter in his eyes that belied the impassioned seriousness of his face
BTS Ol' Villan had a dog once that run away with the wolves Bill cogitates aloud
BTS And how much for one that's all chewed up like this one
BTS I was bloomin' well sure you was a gentleman as soon as I set eyes on yer
BTS They were angry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load
BTS But then I had not seen a woman for a very long time
BTS We are in the right and it must come right
BTS Unlike any animals he had ever encountered they did not bite nor claw
BTS One crawled through tight-locked briers and branches and found oneself on the very edge peering out and down through a green screen
BTS Unless you've got friends about
BTS It was four bells
BTS and the death list had been augmented by the turning loose of a machine-gun on the strikers from the barns of the Marsden Special Delivery Company
BTS At last it showed small and black on the horizon fully fifteen miles away
BTS How's it bear
BTS At the trial and still with honest belief several testified to having seen Ernest prepare to throw the bomb and that it exploded prematurely
BTS At the same instant Buck peered out where the spruce-bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders
BTS It was caused by remarks of Latimer's concerning the noises made by the mate in his sleep and though Johansen was whipped he kept the steerage awake for the rest of the night while he blissfully slumbered and fought the fight over and over again
BTS I could not reconcile these books with the man from what I had seen of him and I wondered if he could possibly read them
BTS while beyond were the tawny hills and upland pastures
BTS And when in addition to this the worn-out huskies pulled weakly Hal decided that the orthodox ration was too small
BTS Many of them have ascribed the strength of the Iron Heel to its system of reward and punishment
BTS Nothing was before us but the three or four months' hunting on the sealing grounds
BTS though he did not know that it was the rest of the lynx litter that had gone to satisfy her
BTS He saw Beauty Smith go away and return with a stout club
BTS Wolf Larsen was watching him waiting for him the steely glitter in his eyes
BTS Two small hands and don't say that was a phrase also of your father
BTS At sight of a sharp knife and a cowardly Cockney the clinging of life to life overcomes all your fond foolishness
BTS Nobody will deny it
BTS Now he studied the sea to windward for signs of the wind slackening or freshening now the Macedonia
BTS In 1835 A
BTS To live
BTS And you are responsible for all this young man he said directly to Ernest
BTS This gave them the seeming of ghostly masques undertakers in a spectral world at the funeral of some ghost
BTS and in the same instant he seemed to see a vision of those same sensitive and delicate fingers being crushed and torn by the white teeth of the she-wolf
BTS Your twenty-four billions of wealth does not give you twenty-five cents' worth of governmental power
BTS An' as he was a-gettin' under way didn't the fond husbands get left astern-like in their sampan as it might be by accident
BTS It was the straightaway now and when it came to real running White Fang could teach her things
BTS Wolf Larsen treasured against them the attempt on his life and the drubbing he had received in the forecastle
BTS He saw the silent circle with gleaming eyes lolling tongues and silvery breaths drifting upward closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past
BTS We were just stepping out upon the sidewalk
BTS We went up to him but he seemed unconscious breathing spasmodically
BTS And I saw that Ernest noted it and was amused
BTS In the end she died peaceably of old age in a secret refuge of the revolutionists in the Ozark mountains
BTS and here it was being infringed upon
BTS Hartman never came out of that entrance
BTS but Wolf Larsen held back through the frightful turmoil as if guided by unerring instinct
BTS Every instinct of his nature would have impelled him to dash wildly away had there not suddenly and for the first time arisen in him another and counter instinct
BTS The hunters came trooping on deck with shot-guns and ammunition-boxes and most unusual their rifles
BTS And after two or three painful adventures with the mothers of part-grown puppies he came into the knowledge that it was always good policy to let such mothers alone to keep away from them as far as possible and to avoid them when he saw them coming
BTS No answer is necessary Mr
BTS The resulting action was a compromise
BTS That's why
BTS I haven't got very far along and as it is I've about lost my bearings
BTS This terrible castigation of her hundred-thousand-dollar lawyer was too much for Miss Brentwood's nerves
BTS In camp he kept close to Mit-sah or Grey Beaver or Kloo-kooch
BTS I have followed the whole discussion with amazement and disgust
BTS And break it out
BTS All powers seemed his all potentialities why then was he no more than the obscure master of a seal-hunting schooner with a reputation for frightful brutality amongst the men who hunted seals
BTS And still we stood the pair of us staring at each other
BTS They violated their own natures yet they loved liberty and knew of no sacrifice too great to make for the Cause
BTS This faithfulness was a quality of the clay that composed him
BTS All was ready
BTS His only apparent ambition like Dave's was to be left alone
BTS But I do not accept his estimate
BTS And we intend to take not the mere wealth in the houses but all the sources of that wealth all the mines and railroads and factories and banks and stores
BTS Pound him on the head
BTS On the morning of the third day shortly after eight bells a cry that the boat was sighted came down from Smoke at the masthead
BTS It still regarded them with the merciless wistfulness of hunger
BTS White Fang would not permit it
BTS Everybody acknowledged Buck a magnificent animal but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their eyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings
BTS as many times as it doubled my strength that many times was doubled the length of rope I heaved in
BTS But what is it
BTS and in all the cities and towns of the land it employs an immense army of pettifoggers and small politicians whose business is to attend primaries pack conventions get on juries bribe judges and in every way to work for its interests
BTS I know for myself that I was shocked into admiration of the boy and I saw in him the splendid invincibleness of immortality rising above the flesh and the fears of the flesh as in the prophets of old to condemn unrighteousness
BTS They were savages all of them who knew no law but the law of club and fang
BTS and Buck still at the head of the team but no longer enforcing discipline or striving to enforce it blind with weakness half the time and keeping the trail by the loom of it and by the dim feel of his feet
BTS And what do I look like pray
BTS And come on
BTS Go ahead and cut I threatened ominously
BTS In the first days after the birth of the cubs One Eye had journeyed several times back to the Indian camp and robbed the rabbit snares
BTS I asked when I stood completely arrayed a tiny boy's cap on my head and for coat a dirty striped cotton jacket which ended at the small of my back and the sleeves of which reached just below my elbows
BTS he hesitated painfully and in his eyes fear leaped large
