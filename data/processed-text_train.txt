BTS He remembered afterwards that his packing had preceded the master's disappearance
BTS and yet in a way this handling and directing of many men was good for me
BTS Consider that I am smiling now
BTS People were falling about me right and left
BTS Leach his bandaged arm prominently to the fore begged me to leave a few remnants of the cook for him
BTS Instead he looked to his hunter for orders
BTS What if he did swashbuckle
BTS We were running behind another train
BTS The shears she said and her voice trembled
BTS But the ocean was bare
BTS The grey cub's eyes had not been open long yet already he could see with steady clearness
BTS He felt the lurking of danger unseen and unguessed

BTS I had no sensation whatever in my lower limbs while a chilling numbness was wrapping about my heart and creeping into it
BTS But he gave no sign of pain and with his single right hand helped us lash the boat in its place
BTS The sacredness of life I had accepted as axiomatic
BTS We were both very tired when we knocked off for supper and we had done good work too though to the eye it appeared insignificant
BTS That was to be expected
BTS The boat-puller obeyed taking a turn around the little forward thwart and paying the line as it jerked taut
BTS and this mandate down out of the depths of Time he obeyed
BTS Then it was that a cry went up from one of the men
BTS Chicago he answered is a pocket edition of hell
BTS His tremendous virility and mental strength wall him apart
BTS What they did is to-day a lost art
BTS He was a superman a blond beast such as Nietzsche has described and in addition he was aflame with democracy
BTS But to the south-west some six hundred miles is Japan
BTS Oh I don't know about that Matt objected
BTS The immediate fighting had ceased and I was watching the balloon attack on the fortresses
BTS It seems to me if we find where they haul out  It seems to me that your fighting instinct is aroused I laughed
BTS This is not a football field
BTS In the end one day fear and obedience were swept away by the rush of life and the cub straddled and sprawled toward the entrance
BTS The big leaders of the Grangers saw the peril and were with us to a man
BTS The soul cannot be ministered to till the stomach is appeased
BTS Possibly the most bloodthirsty and malignant of all the mercenaries that ever served the Iron Heel he was informed by the Fighting Groups that they had tried him found him guilty and condemned him to death--and this after three warnings for him to cease from his ferocious treatment of the proletariat
BTS Then he became angry
BTS It is the soul that decides
BTS What a spectacle he was
BTS We talked a little longer before she went
BTS He is too busy living it to think about it
BTS They were of the active rich and not the idle and they were fighters
BTS From the Speaker the warning leaked out to all the creatures in the House that wore the scarlet livery
BTS Labor's deposits in the savings banks are only a sort of reserve fund that is consumed as fast as it accumulates
BTS Mr
BTS and asleep I left her under a heavy pair of sailor's blankets her head resting on a pillow I had appropriated from Wolf Larsen's bunk
BTS It is too dangerous for you to attempt alone
BTS There was a tremendous snarling and spitting and screeching
BTS What vessel is that
BTS But he was not asleep
BTS But I warn you now and not so much for your own good as for mine that I shall shoot you the moment you attempt a hostile act
BTS He now saw it again
BTS Wells in the late nineteenth century A

BTS Then I've got you
BTS Not only did it not stand them in good stead but it destroyed them
BTS The laboratory preparation of foods had not yet begun
BTS If you can come you will see the cave-man in evening dress snarling and snapping over a bone
BTS Here came to dinner all sorts and conditions of men--scientists politicians bankers merchants professors labor leaders socialists and anarchists
BTS They elevated the end of the hatch-cover with pitiful haste and like a dog flung overside the dead man slid feet first into the sea
BTS Police were running for the spot
BTS His handshake was firm and strong but he looked at me boldly with his black eyes--too boldly I thought
BTS I remained silent undecided
BTS Nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp
BTS I was Hump cabin-boy on the schooner Ghost
BTS Fear sat upon him
BTS Buck and his comrades looked upon them with disgust and though he speedily taught them their places and what not to do he could not teach them what to do
BTS He saw the law operating around him on every side
BTS You have done your work in the world and a great work
BTS His arms were resting on the half-open slide
BTS er quarrelsome and harsh measures are necessary
BTS When it was over and Mugridge was back in the galley he became greasily radiant and went about his work humming coster songs in a nerve-racking and discordant falsetto
BTS When dogs fight there are usually preliminaries to the actual combat snarlings and bristlings and stiff-legged struttings
BTS He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat
BTS Everybody drank
BTS Because he was less brave than God
BTS I suppose up to now your lawyer has done it for you or your business agent
BTS Oh that's all right that's all right the man hastened meekly to say
BTS He shakes his head dubiously over the outlook for the man Johnson who is boat-puller in the same boat with him
BTS In this he was in advance of his party
BTS He changed the course and I signalled affirmation when the speck showed dead ahead
BTS But it was the cold that was most distressing
BTS ' She made me an elaborate and stately courtesy and said As for you sir  And yet through the five minutes of banter which followed there was a serious something underneath the fun which I could not but relate to the strange and fleeting expression I had caught in her eyes
BTS The rest of the pack was now up and surging upon him and a throwing of firebrands right and left was necessary to drive them back to a respectful distance
BTS We lay in the midst of an unearthly quiet while all about us were signs and omens of oncoming sound and movement
BTS With Leach it was different
BTS Ballingford glanced around the table and was rewarded by nods and smiles of approval
BTS That makes a hundred and fifty the saloon-keeper calculated
BTS He openly threatened the other's leadership
BTS I never did a bit of work in my life except to appeal aesthetically to Pharisees--I thought I was preaching the message--and yet I was worth half a million dollars
BTS When they put a clothes-sack on the front of the sled she suggested it should go on the back
BTS To you

BTS The insurance companies know
BTS It was Buck a live hurricane of fury hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy
BTS Before the paralyzed Oligarchy could recover itself its end would have come
BTS It was the Plutocracy through its secret agents that raised the cry that socialism was sacrilegious and atheistic
BTS Have you ever earned a dollar by your own labour
BTS They were accomplishing nothing and the best they hoped for was the putting of an end to the legislative farce in which they were unwilling players
BTS Often and often has the Iron Heel been dumbfounded by the miscarriage of its plans and operations against us
BTS As she is going in the opposite direction she is very probably bound for San Francisco
BTS I'll be back at ten o'clock again
BTS And then she cried Oh Humphrey I am afraid of him
BTS They did nothing
BTS Alas no I answered and asked Can you swim
BTS For once Jim Hall was right
BTS I didn't stop to see if the belt was off
BTS But it will serve only when we are sailing by the wind I explained
BTS Look out
BTS Do you know what I was reminded of as I sat at table and listened to you talk and talk
BTS It was good that men should be specialists I mused
BTS I hesitated to descend
BTS He would go and see
BTS What could I do
BTS Thus great statesmen--and there had been such occasions--were able fully to speak their minds
BTS One day they had grub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left Dawson for the head-waters of the Tanana the men and dogs were sitting on the crest of a cliff which fell away straight down to naked bed-rock three hundred feet below
BTS In those days so sparsely populated was the land that wild animals often became pests
BTS There was a leap swifter than his unpractised sight and the lean yellow body disappeared for a moment out of the field of his vision
BTS Watching his chance he darted away and the chase was resumed
BTS There was a jingle of bells
BTS In fact when he had but partly learned the law his impression was that he must leave all live things alone
BTS Surely there can be little in this world more awful than the spectacle of a strong man in the moment when he is utterly weak and broken
BTS As compared with the Indians he had known they were to him another race of beings a race of superior gods
BTS Eh
BTS And grip and thrill they did till I fell asleep murmuring them to myself over and over again
BTS As I understood it there were two ways of getting it cleared first by lowering the foresail which was comparatively easy and without danger
BTS Only I said it on the other side of my mouth
BTS The men who came ashore from the steamers were newcomers
BTS but in her instinct which was the experience of all the mothers of wolves there lurked a memory of fathers that had eaten their new-born and helpless progeny
BTS We expected the beach to lift up this way and that and the rocky walls to swing back and forth like the sides of a ship
BTS They proved that a seal pup could swim or not swim at birth by stating the proposition very bellicosely and then following it up with an attack on the opposing man's judgment common sense nationality or past history
BTS While Baseek had been growing weaker with age White Fang had been growing stronger with youth
BTS I got little out of him
BTS You do me proud Hump
BTS Will you protest
BTS Do you know what will happen to Farley and his strike-breakers
BTS There was no freshness in the air
BTS and in roar of shell and shrapnel and in whine of machine-guns shall our answer be couched
BTS It was beginning to show
BTS A scarecrow I'm afraid I replied
BTS If trouble comes will you stand by
BTS How are your headaches
BTS Lost overboard
BTS what chance of chances
BTS And he knew it in the old familiar way as a sound heard before
BTS Better reef the jib and mainsail too while you're about it
BTS He did not see me
BTS The situation was something that really exceeded rational formulas for conduct and demanded more than the cold conclusions of reason
BTS He backed farther away
BTS And house and lot had always been free and unencumbered
BTS Thereafter we looked with speculative comprehension at the windows
BTS Not that
BTS It came hard going as it did counter to much that was strong and dominant in his own nature
BTS He had to be taken into account that was all
BTS Of course much grumbling went on and little outbursts were continually occurring
BTS It was no larger than a hall bedroom in Grub Street and yet twelve men were herded into it to eat and sleep and carry on all the functions of living
BTS So I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem
BTS All my reading and studying of them has taught me that law is one thing and right is another thing
BTS They dwelt in cities of their own which were practically self-governed and they were granted many privileges
BTS Oh but you didn't she hurried on divining my answer
BTS to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not
BTS Nor was his uninjured hand behind his back hiding something
BTS That was before the Earthquake
BTS It was possibly a minute before he spoke
BTS As the front of it passed under the warring buildings both went into action again--one building dropping bombs into the street being attacked from across the street and in return replying to that attack
BTS It was the first time I had heard her sing and I lay by the fire listening and transported for she was nothing if not an artist in everything she did and her voice though not strong was wonderfully sweet and expressive
BTS '  An' 'ow's that
BTS The first conspicuous excursion and incursion of the Rockefellers was into the railway field
BTS Beef-tea
BTS And then I said Twenty-seven years old and still free and fancy free
BTS The roar of it filled my ears and I saw Ernest reeling and falling in a swirl of smoke and the soldiers rushing up all the aisles
BTS The elevation of frames of poles caught his eye
BTS It was an easy task for Anna Roylston to win Timothy Donnelly
BTS I got the word fifteen minutes ago and I have already passed it along
BTS I stopped for I did not know what was coming and saw the galley door slide shut with a bang
BTS The two mongrels were without spirit at all
BTS I take it as proof that Berkeley's metaphysics did not work because-- Ernest paused calmly for a moment
BTS and it came to Buck leading the pack sounding the old wolf-cry straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight
BTS He would have been glad for the rattle of stones about him flung by an angry squaw glad for the hand of Grey Beaver descending upon him in wrath
BTS I have seen Harrison called from his bunk to put properly away a misplaced paintbrush and the two watches below haled from their tired sleep to accompany him and see him do it
BTS His wolfish appearance caught their eyes at once and they pointed him out to one another
BTS Forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence
BTS I cried
BTS He never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word and to sit down for a long talk with them gas he called it was as much his delight as theirs
BTS Watch out
BTS She has lived with the wolves said a third Indian
BTS But a week later we read in the newspaper of the sad case of Bishop Morehouse who had been committed to the Napa Asylum and for whom there were still hopes held out
BTS And yet I found Colonel Ingram situated the same as the unlettered mechanics
BTS Life was soft and easy
BTS There were artists scientists scholars musicians and poets among us
BTS Wicked men though they be they are certainly very much afraid of him
BTS In the cities of the Mercenaries and of the labor castes similar programmes of disruption were to be carried out
BTS At first he snarled and tried to fight
BTS It is clumsy but it will serve the purpose and that is the main thing I went on yearning for her praise
BTS Together they looked at White Fang at the end of his stretched chain bristling snarling ferocious straining to get at the sled-dogs
BTS Fourteen boats require a considerable spread of ocean for comfortable hunting and when she had completely lapped our line she continued steaming into the north-east dropping more boats as she went
BTS There was no fight left in Lip-lip and he ran away shamelessly his victim hot on his heels and worrying him all the way back to his own tepee
BTS You kick it into the ditch
BTS He stood still ears pricked forward alert and curious surveying the strange animal that faced him
BTS Johnson's breath suddenly expelled shot from his mouth and as suddenly checked with the forced audible expiration of a man wielding an axe
BTS His head was bowed
BTS It was unparalleled undreamed-of that I Humphrey Van Weyden a scholar and a dilettante if you please in things artistic and literary should be lying here on a Bering Sea seal-hunting schooner
BTS The man you drove from Eden's grove Was I my Lord was I And I shall be there when the earth and the air Are rent from sea to sky
BTS One-quarter of this cent came to us
BTS Wolf Larsen demanded sharply and imperatively
BTS If they strike the first violent blow we will strike the last
BTS Out of fear for the welfare of their families men devised the scheme of insurance
BTS So it would seem
BTS No more bombs fell from the windows the last pedestrians seemed to have vanished from the streets and our immediate quietude grew more profound
BTS Let me show you
BTS Then he looked back eagerly and questioningly at the master
BTS But each time it was the bulging face of the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle
BTS Her plates are scarred by the sun dear lass And her ropes are taut with the dew For we're booming down on the old trail our own trail the out trail We're sagging south on the Long Trail the trail that is always new
BTS One other experience of similar nature was his
BTS And about the meat there seemed nothing wrong
BTS I say Hump's improving don't you think so
BTS Three-quarters of a million of miners went out on strike
BTS Better sling yer 'ook out of 'ere Yonson he said
BTS But on the forecastle-head we found three sailors asleep
BTS for the memory of them is forgotten
BTS Once down that was the end of you
BTS I tried to break in on the man's morbid thoughts by calling him away but he smiled sadly at me and refused to obey
BTS Hi-yu Major
BTS In vain the Grangers pleaded with us
BTS So be it civil war was Mr
BTS He was an individual
BTS The chickens he calmly ignored
BTS Christ told the rich young man to sell all he had Ernest said bitterly
BTS For profit--his life blood transmuted into a wine-supper or a jewelled gewgaw or some similar sense-orgy of the parasitic and idle rich his masters the arch-beasts
BTS The five boats went over the side with a rush spread out like the ribs of a fan and set a northerly course as on the preceding afternoon for us to follow
BTS You see the powerful interests rising and growing more powerful day by day
BTS and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole he would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs
BTS White Fang would not permit it
BTS But the saloon-keeper let him alone and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate
BTS That bear reached out his paws tonight to crush us
BTS His progress was a series of yelps from which might have been adduced the number of rocks he encountered
BTS After they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled came back for her and by main strength put her on the sled again
BTS There was no sound
BTS hot coffee
BTS A puff of wind caught me and I staggered across the moving deck to a corner of the cabin to which I clung for support
BTS The grey light of day that remained lasted until three o'clock when it too faded and the pall of the Arctic night descended upon the lone and silent land
BTS A rain of pecks fell on his ill-used nose
BTS Now what of the lady
BTS Then he turned and trotted back to Grey Beaver's camp
BTS It was a primitive mode of reasoning and of looking at things that he understood thoroughly
BTS Johansen who had caught the contagion of Wolf Larsen's masterfulness burst out with a volley of abuse and curses
BTS The source of his financial strength lay wholly in the middle class
BTS And even as he looked the brute deliberately stretched himself after the manner of a lazy dog yawning full in his face and looking upon him with a possessive eye as if in truth he were merely a delayed meal that was soon to be eaten
BTS This was to fight his way across the floor to the ladder
BTS He had only intermittent use of it
BTS So it was at last impressed upon me that I was there not to have Wolf Larsen take the initiative but to take it myself
BTS He had no chance
BTS All tense and trembling with eagerness and desire he mastered his instinct and stood still
BTS CHAPTER I THE TRAIL OF THE MEAT Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway
BTS That I should take a knife or a gun or an axe and kill this man
BTS Your hunter's decided to stay aboard awhile and doesn't want it pounding alongside
BTS Then he crawled into the heart of a dense thicket and waited
BTS He could not be satisfied with less as Matt learned after much inconvenience and trouble
BTS They will be like the guards of the palace in old Rome and there will be palace revolutions whereby the labor castes will seize the reins of power
BTS But that was long ago she continued
BTS Leave it where it is
BTS I was seeing the other side of the shield
BTS Food
BTS Not that he was abashed
BTS and ten minutes later when the smoke had fairly cleared I allowed Maud to come below
BTS But the other kind was divided
BTS I abruptly saw that a policeman was in the act of shooting Hartman
BTS The cub's fear of the unknown was an inherited distrust and it had now been strengthened by experience
BTS He can't keep this up Wolf Larsen said
BTS Never heard of it he broke in
BTS an' then some
BTS We of the Revolution will go on with that great work but it will not be done by the miserable serfs
BTS All their old liberties were gone
BTS He held steadily on his way
BTS We must do something
BTS Nor did he speak till he had taken his seat on the coffin and begun to eat
BTS I rowed a couple of hundred feet along the beach so as to recover my nerves and then stepped ashore again
BTS 'Tis him that'll put the fear of God in their rotten black hearts
BTS Therefore they proceeded to break the machines
BTS This was the startling effect of the cessation of motion
BTS redoubled
BTS It was a cold-blooded exhibition of marksmanship
BTS White Fang crawled slowly cringing and grovelling in the abjectness of his abasement and submission
BTS and it was the most natural thing in the world that he should obey it by turning his back on his new-born family and by trotting out and away on the meat-trail whereby he lived
BTS Great God
BTS Louis has also given me additional information about Death Larsen which tallies with the captain's brief description
BTS Our minds were at ease
BTS I mean what I said
BTS But Spitz cold and calculating even in his supreme moods left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around
BTS By his side were Bishop Dickinson
BTS His blood might pay off a mortgage or send a son to college
BTS This was sent out all over the country in an Associated Press despatch and from all over the country arose a cry of alarm
BTS Labor does not consume its two billions even Mr
BTS Tragedy had dwindled the farce had begun
BTS Take them aboard and deal gently with them
BTS For an appreciable lapse of time Ernest's voice continued to ring through the great room
BTS By God I'll not be robbed of my boat by any storm that ever blew out of hell
BTS This was the world the universe itself its bounds so near one felt impelled to reach out both arms and push them back
BTS It bit like fire and the next instant was gone
BTS I was resolved
BTS Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights
BTS By virtue of that power we shall remain in power
BTS that he was thrilled and upborne with knowledge that one of the great moments of living when the tide of life surges up in flood was upon him
BTS To the north I could see the loom of Sonoma Mountain toward which we rode
BTS In fact was it not true of all the industries
BTS Then I understood
BTS Besides the water was frightfully cold and his was anything but a rugged constitution
BTS Never had Mrs
BTS This White Fang quickly discovered by mixing with those that came ashore with their masters
BTS Sell them to countries with undeveloped resources Mr
BTS But the elder leader was wise very wise in love even as in battle
BTS It is because you are not a trust
BTS Cooky did that he laughed again
BTS It was a full-grown mosquito one that had lain frozen in a dry log all winter and that had now been thawed out by the sun
BTS All his bluster had gone and he seemed to have caught the contagion of preternatural calm
BTS You have not answered
BTS Incidentally its public schools deteriorated and education slowly ceased to be compulsory
BTS In spite of his fear at the reckoning he must expect to pay for what he had done he could see that it had been an object-lesson to me and he became more domineering and exultant
BTS Everhard and eleven others among whom were Theodore Donnelson and Matthew Kent received life imprisonment
BTS The top one I had drawn over her face to shelter it from the night so I could see nothing but the vague shape of her and her light-brown hair escaped from the covering and jewelled with moisture from the air
BTS All hands were on deck for they knew that something was to happen when Leach and Johnson were dragged aboard
BTS What's the matter with America
BTS It devised a plan of reaching its subscribers through the express companies but they declined to handle it
BTS He was beaten down to movelessness by an overwhelming sense of his own weakness and littleness
BTS And then everything was suddenly made clear
BTS All that was visible was the mass of men fastened upon him
BTS They seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of John Thornton
BTS and often blinking by the fire Buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered
BTS But the men were no longer eager as they pulled and hauled and I heard curses amongst them which left their lips smothered and as heavy and lifeless as were they
BTS He backed away bewildered and puzzled
BTS Why we've got to make the best of the first of it and run down to our boats before our canvas is ripped out of us
BTS Fair wind
BTS More freely because it costs you nothing
BTS A hawk driving down out of the blue had barely missed him
BTS That's a suggestion he added in an aside to me
BTS Maud insisted on helping and I could have wept over her bruised and bleeding hands
BTS He was crying with sheer rage and eagerness as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in
BTS Otherwise he ignored them
BTS They patted him on the head and passed on contented and pleased with their own daring
BTS No truer more loyal man ever labored for the Cause
BTS To Buck's surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him
BTS This quarrel over the division was irreconcilable
BTS they make and unmake United States Senators congressmen and governors and are practically dictators of the governmental policy of the United States
BTS In some places across the chest and shoulders and down the outside of the arms and thighs it was matted into almost a thick fur
BTS It's too bad but it served him right Scott said hastily
BTS masts ropes and rails spattered with the sanguinary colour
BTS Knife just like this
BTS and White Fang looked on with wondering eyes
BTS They were ordinary unsuspecting dogs
BTS He lived there three years
BTS You jes' bet they will Bill affirmed
BTS The dividends are paid out of their blood
BTS I could see the effect Ernest was beginning to have on him
BTS Tell him I want him
BTS I can only reaffirm my position Dr
BTS Knowing him I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding
BTS When next I awoke a sickly yellow light was filtering in on me
BTS You would have time retrace its steps from noon to morning
BTS It was to the rear somewhere in the snow expanse they had just traversed
BTS I was still weak from my prolonged immersion
BTS And yet I must say that Judge Caldwell did a whole lot to prevent my getting that very testimony
BTS the master commanded when he had ascertained his injury
BTS And it was he that first gripped another cub by the ear and pulled and tugged and growled through jaws tight-clenched
BTS He gave them the trail as a privilege indubitably theirs
BTS I knew I must do it secretly else they would have taken everything away from me
BTS You must understand Miss Brewster and understand clearly that this man is a monster
BTS The idea was that the empty train should receive the disaster were an attempt made to blow up the Twentieth Century
BTS She was gazing at the Ghost
BTS He was the Wild the unknown the terrible the ever-menacing the thing that prowled in the darkness around the fires of the primeval world when they cowering close to the fires were reshaping their instincts learning to fear the Wild out of which they had come and which they had deserted and betrayed
BTS He certainly was of a superior kind
BTS And it was required of me that this should be the gravest of responsibilities for she was the one woman in the world the one small woman as I loved to think of her
BTS And to clinch the argument there were the several Congressmen who testified to having seen Ernest fumble and drop the bomb
BTS Metaphysics had nothing to do with it Ernest retorted
BTS It still rang in my ears and I felt that I should like to hear it again--and to see again that glint of laughter in his eyes that belied the impassioned seriousness of his face
BTS But my happiness was not unalloyed
BTS As I obeyed I noticed an anxious light come into Johnson's eyes but I did not dream of its cause
BTS That was why I became a physicist
BTS Set men at all the sheets
BTS Two small hands and don't say that was a phrase also of your father
BTS Besides he was hungry
BTS It was going hard with him
BTS Some of the hunters glanced anxiously aloft
BTS In the past he had liked comfort and surcease from pain disliked discomfort and pain and he had adjusted his actions accordingly
BTS As it was I scrambled to my feet and cried out the danger call
BTS But the pot was beyond arm's length and beside Henry
BTS Also he doesn't want to get drunk
BTS They might be town-reared dogs but the instinctive fear of the Wild was theirs just the same
BTS How can two particles of the yeast wrong each other by striving to devour each other
BTS A decade before this speech of Everhard's the New York Board of Trade issued a report from which the following is quoted The railroads control absolutely the legislatures of a majority of the states of the Union
BTS It was made of stout birch-bark and its full surface rested on the snow
BTS He notched the stick at each end and in the notches fastened strings of raw-hide
BTS Well in a way there has come to be a sort of connection I answered unsurprised by this time at such gaps in his vocabulary which like his knowledge was the acquirement of a self-read self-educated man whom no one had directed in his studies and who had thought much and talked little or not at all
BTS No word needed to be spoken
BTS He did not calculate such things
BTS What do you think of that
BTS In that moment White Fang was in upon him and out in passing ripping his trimmed remnant of an ear
BTS There will be great achievements in science and especially in art
BTS The six boats spreading out fan-wise from the schooner until the first weather boat and the last lee boat were anywhere from ten to twenty miles apart cruised along a straight course over the sea till nightfall or bad weather drove them in
BTS It was a real attack this time I said another shock like the one that made him blind
BTS Impelled by the blows that rained upon him now from this side now from that White Fang swung back and forth like an erratic and jerky pendulum
BTS He yielded to the master's children with an ill but honest grace and endured their fooling as one would endure a painful operation
BTS It advertised his callowness a callowness sheer and unutterable
BTS Astronomy and physics were represented and I remarked Bulfinch's Age of Fable Shaw's History of English and American Literature and Johnson's Natural History in two large volumes
BTS I sometimes thought my mind would give way under it a meet thing on this ship of madmen and brutes
BTS He pleaded with his eyes to remain there
BTS Then by observation whenever opportunity offered by study of action speech and the very intonations of the voice he slowly learned the intimacy and the degree of favour they enjoyed with the master
BTS He had not learned to be dependent on his kind for companionship
BTS Lively now
BTS He would return and see how his own team-mates were making out
BTS This gave place to a sense of intolerable anguish
BTS Day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller and though one day was very like another it was apparent to Buck that the weather was steadily growing colder
BTS He seemed to remember it all the white woods and earth and moonlight and the thrill of battle
BTS They looked forward to it with as much anticipation as did the Indian dogs while they were not slow to appreciate the savage and crafty part played by White Fang
BTS But suppose he desires to do two opposite things neither of which will permit him to do the other
BTS Here the sea was calm save for a heavy but smooth ground-swell and I took in the sea-anchor and began to row
BTS But more remarkable than this the Yeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack
BTS Jordan
BTS I don't understand
BTS No shipping masters or beach-combers over here and he wants yer in his business and he wants yer bad
BTS A change in the battle crushed him under both their bodies and wrenched loose his hold
BTS Not the least bit
BTS This has been the strength of the Iron Heel and too many of the comrades have been slow or loath to realize it
BTS and if he failed to find it like the Indian he kept on travelling secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to it
BTS But nothing happened
BTS Also I am to wear evening dress
BTS That's a steam-siren a-goin' it over there to the left
BTS This last with a sneering ring of triumph in it
BTS Beauty Smith regained his feet and came toward him sniffling and cowardly
BTS will not drive us hence
BTS Running off before the wind with everything to starboard he came about and returned close-hauled on the port tack
BTS There is plenty more life demanding to be born
BTS It was wide and heavy and protruded outward and down until it seemed to rest on his chest
BTS No more grease and dirt mind and a clean shirt occasionally or you'll get a tow over the side
BTS I queried
BTS that could grow chill as an arctic landscape and yet again that could warm and soften and be all a-dance with love-lights intense and masculine luring and compelling which at the same time fascinate and dominate women till they surrender in a gladness of joy and of relief and sacrifice
BTS Larger older and stronger Lip-lip had selected White Fang for his special object of persecution
BTS Or at least it seems to me that such was society's attitude
BTS I learned all that at college before you were born
BTS At last the time came that he decided to eat the meat from the hand
BTS Life streamed through him in splendid flood glad and rampant until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and pour forth generously over the world
BTS but Kloo-kooch welcomed him with glad cries and the whole of a fresh-caught fish and he lay down to wait Grey Beaver's coming
BTS He visited Grey Beaver's camp often and hidden under his coat was always a black bottle or so
BTS It developed what little executive ability I possessed and I was aware of a toughening or hardening which I was undergoing and which could not be anything but wholesome for Sissy Van Weyden
BTS I was for putting my arm around her as when in the midst of the seal herd
BTS Fallacy upon fallacy
BTS Was it carelessness
BTS One day they openly sicked the dogs on him
BTS Proofs to the contrary
BTS It was the beginning of the end for White Fang the ending of the old life and the reign of hate
BTS He crouched and bristled a little at the thought of it
BTS Cutting our purses he answered
BTS We ate dinner a hurried and anxious meal for me with eighteen men abroad on the sea and beyond the bulge of the earth and with that heaven-rolling mountain range of clouds moving slowly down upon us
BTS I thought it a certain silly fastidiousness on my part but it persisted in spite of me and I merely shrugged my shoulders in answer
BTS He was a monstrous tyrant
BTS Never had he seen such a dog
BTS He carries the lives of hundreds of us in his hands and I think he is a traitor
BTS Thornton's bluff if bluff it was had been called
BTS Their common reply was that they were glad of the opportunity to make it perfectly plain that no premium would ever be put on carelessness by them
BTS There was something ominous about it and in intangible ways one was made to feel that the worst was about to come
BTS he had buried his teeth in the flesh of a foe
BTS I limped to the galley and handed it to him
BTS I won't say they was all dogs but there was seven of 'm that got fish
BTS Ye can't tell what'll be happenin' Louis went on in response to my query for more definite information
BTS You'll never see eighteen again
BTS In the worst pinches of the famine he stole back to the fires of the gods
BTS The schooner sailed herself
BTS he cried
BTS The noises grew indistinct though I heard a final and despairing chorus of screams in the distance and knew that the Martinez had gone down
BTS Perhaps it was from excess
BTS and even then in his own pitiable plight White Fang experienced a little grateful thrill
BTS I told him that unhappily for the burial service I was not a preacher when he sharply demanded What do you do for a living
BTS He quite ignored my presence though I credited him with being simply unable to see me
BTS She paused at the mouth of the cave and looked the wall over carefully
BTS There is another way of disqualifying the metaphysicians Ernest said when he had rendered Dr
BTS All hands lined the rail
BTS Wolf Larsen will be left a prisoner on board
BTS and our moments were sweeter for being stolen
BTS He accepted it as he accepted all the unaccountable doings and manifestations of the gods
BTS Hammerfield retorted tartly
BTS To show the tenor of thought the following definition is quoted from The Cynic's Word Book 1906 A
BTS Dispense with all the moral courage you can I said briskly
BTS the seas would swamp it the moment it fell into the trough
BTS At midday the sky to the south warmed to rose-colour and marked where the bulge of the earth intervened between the meridian sun and the northern world
BTS My heart was surely in my eyes for a moment
BTS He did not rush a second time
BTS it may be a very beautiful spirit that will go soaring up into the blue from that ugly carcass
BTS Large or small the railroad always gets my profits
BTS therefore the picture must be accepted as a true picture
BTS He jerked his shoulder petulantly away from the grip of his questioner
BTS Buck because of his record was the target for these men and Thornton was driven stoutly to defend him
BTS Finally he could stand it no longer
BTS At the mouth of the Tahkeena one night after supper Dub turned up a snowshoe rabbit blundered it and missed
BTS It is perhaps well to tell a little something about this obscure document which in the main is of interest to the historian only
BTS What's up now
BTS What is to be done
BTS You are good to look upon in a way I qualified
BTS Maud had sunk down upon the deck and was I knew lying motionless her body in the shadow of the bulwark
BTS Having grown tired apparently of the task she relinquished the oar to me
BTS Then milk was raised another cent only we didn't get any of that cent
BTS But the Wild is the Wild and motherhood is motherhood at all times fiercely protective whether in the Wild or out of it

BTS He'll have to learn and he shall without postponement Scott said
BTS The United States is a capitalist country that has developed its resources
BTS Johnson fought bravely enough but he was no match for Wolf Larsen much less for Wolf Larsen and the mate
BTS I remembered the watch-tackle a small double and single block affair and fetched it
BTS He attacked them when he caught them alone and they attacked him when they were bunched
BTS I just counted
BTS It is the bribe for living the champagne of the blood the effervescence of the ferment that makes some men think holy thoughts and other men to see God or to create him when they cannot see him
BTS Time and again when a mob of them was well in hand and being driven along the streets to the water the comrades would create a diversion and the mob would escape through the consequent hole torn in the encircling net
BTS How do you know
BTS You've got to cut it short
BTS With the arrival of a steamer the fun began
BTS But I am mate now and when I pay off at 'Frisco maybe with five hundred dollars I will ship myself on a windjammer round the Horn to Liverpool which will give me more money
BTS This made Lip-lip the leader and was apparently an honour
BTS My fingers were torn loose and I swept across to the side and over the side into the sea
BTS What shall I do
BTS Thornton alone held him
BTS The Ghost was slipping through the water at no more than three miles an hour and the sea was fairly calm
BTS He had grown stronger and wiser and more confident
BTS Our plans I suppose Ernest sneered
BTS He might have been a trifle graver than of yore but the glint of laughter still was in his eyes
BTS We will meet him most probably on the Japan coast
BTS Father insisted on laboratory methods
BTS This one indicating me with his thumb fancies sea-serpents and monkeys just now
BTS but Cherokee held on
BTS CHAPTER XIX I came on deck to find the Ghost heading up close on the port tack and cutting in to windward of a familiar spritsail close-hauled on the same tack ahead of us
BTS But Ernest never gave quarter to an enemy
BTS Also he used to call me his dualist and he would explain how Kant by means of pure reason had abolished reason in order to worship God
BTS Through the dim smoke-haze the bunks looked like the sleeping dens of animals in a menagerie
BTS and those meals
BTS She looked at him merely with a great wistfulness but he knew it to be the wistfulness of an equally great hunger
BTS But upon me had devolved the task of tending their wounds and pulling them through and I did my best by them
BTS The cub could not understand
BTS As he talked with reluctant movements he drew his revolver threw open the cylinder and assured himself of its contents
BTS She dearly loved children but she held that a child of her own would claim her from the Cause and that it was the Cause to which her life was devoted
BTS I'll be coughin' blood before eyght bells
BTS This was the thing I had set my mind upon doing but the opportunity never offered
BTS Buck was beset by three huskies and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed
BTS She was very tired
BTS He had reference to troop-trains on the side-track
BTS It is true it was a vicarious experience else he would not have lived to profit by it
BTS In three hours it was midnight I well remember and as dark as I had ever seen it on the sea the wind still blowing out of the south-west rose furiously and once again I was compelled to set the sea-anchor
BTS My chest was raw and red and I could see tiny blood globules starting through the torn and inflamed cuticle
BTS He had not eaten in forty hours and he was weak with hunger
BTS You must begin over again
BTS But they were merely strays and did not count and they were gathered in anyway during the following year
BTS Matt unsnapped the chain from the collar and stepped back
BTS He has said there are a million and a half of revolutionists in the United States
BTS White Fang sprang in a rage at the throat of the offending horse but was checked by the master's voice
BTS and at the end of three hundred yards amid a mad swirl of water he overhauled Thornton
BTS It was clear he did not wish to run too far away from them
BTS You are right he said
BTS From beginning to end the length of the stream was no more than five hundred yards
BTS Of course they saw nothing of the sort
BTS Buck led the pack sixty strong around bend after bend but he could not gain
BTS And Chicago became the storm-centre of the premature First Revolt
BTS but if you throw your fortunes in with the working class--well watch out for your face that is all
BTS At the Pelly one morning as they were harnessing up Dolly who had never been conspicuous for anything went suddenly mad
BTS The surpluses will have to be expended somehow he answered
BTS There was nothing threatening about her
BTS I remembered Ernest's charge that my gown was stained with blood and my flesh began to crawl underneath my garments
BTS Do not forget he said that we had tacitly agreed that liberty in your case gentlemen means liberty to squeeze profits out of others
BTS Go home
BTS Grey Beaver laughed and nodded approval
BTS He took no notice
BTS He had never seen the whole poem and he had tried vainly to learn its authorship
BTS In the light baffling airs the schooner had been tacking about a great deal at which times the sails pass from one side to the other and a man is sent aloft to shift over the fore-gaff-topsail
BTS Now that we've everything cleaned up we'll have the funeral and get the decks cleared of useless lumber
BTS They crossed low divides and ranged a dozen small streams in a lower-lying country before their quest was rewarded
BTS He was very kind--for an oligarch
BTS And before the wind we were and leaping when Johnson easing his sheet at imminent peril cut across our wake a hundred feet away
BTS The quiet buildings looked down upon the scene from their many windows
BTS Van Weyden for the present at any rate earns his salty grub by assisting me
BTS So a lurking humor ran through his deeds and it was his delight to steal upon the squirrels and when he all but had them to let them go chattering in mortal fear to the treetops
BTS And sure enough
BTS We'll trust our lives to it
BTS The storm broke that night which is to say that it diminished as slowly as it had arisen
BTS In spite of his armour of fur the great vein of his throat would have long since been torn open had not the first grip of the bull-dog been so low down as to be practically on the chest
BTS I feel as if all time were echoing through me as though all powers were mine
BTS Thinking that he was asleep and wishing him to escape reprimand or worse I spoke to him
BTS Buck stood it keeping his mates up to their work and maintaining discipline though he too was very tired
BTS It was the same with his hair sparse and irregular of growth muddy-yellow and dirty-yellow rising on his head and sprouting out of his face in unexpected tufts and bunches in appearance like clumped and wind-blown grain
BTS But this quarter of a million does not control the government though it renders yeoman service
BTS and when the last fight was over and White Fang and the pack had scattered he would return slowly to the fort his face heavy with regret
BTS After all pure spirit was unknowable a thing to be sensed and divined only
BTS The divergence of opinion on the parts of Mary McKenna and the Bishop do menace society
BTS but the one thing we could not afford to fail in was the punishment of our own traitors
BTS They had no chance to make a break for liberty in one of the boats
BTS But Charles and Hal did not know this
BTS It was the wolf manner of fighting to strike and leap away
BTS When a steamer arrived the men of the fort made it a point always to come down to the bank and see the fun
BTS And yet there was a certain ascetic lengthening of the lines of his face
BTS Besides his hands were full with his sister or his arms rather
BTS It is what we of the working class preach
BTS She was still in working order and she was still working
BTS After a sleepless night I arose weak and in agony to hobble through my second day on the Ghost
BTS He sat down to consider listening to the silence of the forest and perturbed by it
BTS The wolves behind collided with the young wolf and expressed their displeasure by administering sharp nips on his hind-legs and flanks
BTS At the same moment Matt noticed two objects lying in the snow
BTS His first prominence had come when he broke the Shardwell will
BTS The sealing boats are not made for windward work
BTS Usually this occurred at night so as to avoid interference from the mounted police of the Territory
BTS Yet it is upon feeling more often than thinking that animals act
BTS It was a logical and crushing indictment of the whole system of education that developed in the minds of the students only such ideas as were favorable to the capitalistic regime to the exclusion of all ideas that were inimical and subversive
BTS You won't be a thousand years in finding out and in the meantime just pray for plenty of wind
BTS The common and ordinary man was the answer
BTS Telegraph Hill of course is your port of entry
BTS He was aware only of curiosity in all the things about him
BTS His eyes were blazing his mouth was wide open
BTS Membership in the labor castes will become hereditary
BTS I would make it well
BTS There was no possible chance of missing him no matter how poor my marksmanship
BTS It was only next day when Wainwright Island loomed to windward close abeam that Wolf Larsen opened his mouth in prophecy
BTS Since White Fang continued to fight it is obvious that it was the other dogs that died
BTS And he has never philosophized on life I added
BTS I shall use my judgment when to look and when not to look she replied with a grand air
BTS but the animal betrayed no fear
BTS Midway in the passage the current picked up the cub and swept him downstream
BTS This under his direction I cleansed and sewed together having first shaved the edges of the wound
BTS Originally they were private detectives
BTS I had learned to look more closely at life as it was lived to recognize that there were such things as facts in the world to emerge from the realm of mind and idea and to place certain values on the concrete and objective phases of existence
BTS That was evidently the crime of crimes the one offence there was no condoning nor overlooking
BTS There is no trusting one
BTS I spoke stoutly but I did not believe a word
BTS Wolf Larsen thundered
BTS It grew larger and so swiftly that for the first time I fully appreciated the speed of our flight
BTS Lively
BTS And closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still sounding in the depths of the forest
BTS The battle is not always to the strong
BTS And the highest finest right conduct I interjected is that act which benefits at the same time the man his children and his race
BTS The code of my group was stronger than I
BTS The one might wag but the others held their terrible grip on White Fang's throat
BTS But the fight lasted so long that he had time to cry himself out and to experience a second burst of courage
BTS but do not come down to the working class and serve as false leaders
BTS Through the cracks in the bottom of the upper bunk he had set fire to the mattress
BTS I recoiled before contemplation of that frightful death and for a moment I entertained the wild idea of seizing Maud in my arms and leaping overboard
BTS Yahoo
BTS I confess I had never had such a question asked me before nor had I ever canvassed it
BTS Now don't say Please please' I cried half angrily I do believe
BTS They advocated government ownership of such trusts as the railroads and telegraphs and excessive income taxes graduated with ferocity to destroy large accumulations
BTS The sight of him was sufficient to start them rushing after him at which times his swiftness usually carried him into safety
BTS You see he said to her
BTS While I toiled up the fore-shrouds the Ghost slowly paid off
BTS White Fang trembled with fear and though the impulse came to crawl out of his hiding-place he resisted it
BTS I experienced a positive sensuous delight as I crawled into the bed she had made with her hands
BTS It is nothing to what will come Ernest went on if you persist in your policy of having these socialists and radicals of all sorts at your house myself included
BTS How did it happen
BTS At first he was not heard
BTS It was lean with long-standing hunger
BTS Weedon Scott patted him and his throat rumbled an acknowledging growl
BTS Also the beggar said that there was talk tea-table gossip and so forth about my daughter being seen in public with so notorious a character as you and that it was not in keeping with university tone and dignity
BTS I could have shouted with joy at her control
BTS And then across the narrow oblong box each nodded to the other
BTS They ain't had a bite in weeks I reckon outside of Fatty an' Frog an' Spanker
BTS Now Anna Roylston was a fascinating woman
BTS then added with a sigh of relief and unaware that she had glanced that relief at Wolf Larsen I am so glad
BTS Francois unfastened Sol-leks's traces and put him back in his old place
BTS Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labour that I had laboured to do
BTS A few minutes later the remainder of the tribe strung out as it was on the march trailed in
BTS Hold on there
BTS That is the revolution
BTS And then where a vagrant shaft of sunlight struck the ocean and turned its surface to wrathful silver I caught a small black speck thrust skyward for an instant and swallowed up
BTS But upon his way he demanded consideration
BTS please
BTS Yes she answered
BTS But in that age insurance was a very serious matter
BTS Alas
BTS Henry grunted and began unlacing his moccasins
BTS Gad sir
BTS To be sure it was an unwonted performance but he had learned to trust in men he knew and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own
BTS If I don't get the hydrophoby  It'll be because you was born to hang laughed the saloon-keeper
BTS Hope was alive again in my breast and I looked about me with greater coolness
BTS A queer sense familiarity made me look again
BTS He favoured me with a vicious stare
BTS Colonel Van Gilbert cried out
BTS All cities and towns were like armed camps and laborers were shot down like dogs
BTS 'Tis no egg-shell'll float on this sea an hour come an' it's a stroke iv luck for them we're here to pick 'em up
BTS How was it added
BTS And they told you true John Thornton answered
BTS She will be your representative in the battle-front
BTS If you will read your biology and your sociology as clearly as you do your history you will see that this end I have described is inevitable
BTS of myself unable to read or write cabin-boy at the mature age of ten on the coastwise old-country ships
BTS If you do not now point out a flaw in my definition you are disqualified later on from advancing metaphysical arguments
BTS When unusual needs arose for them such as the building of the great highways and air-lines of canals tunnels subways and fortifications levies were made on the labor-ghettos and tens of thousands of serfs willy-nilly were transported to the scene of operations
BTS It means we'll have to marry earlier than you planned was Ernest's comment when we told him
BTS Wot you t'ink eh Perrault
BTS It smelled sour and musty and by the dim light of the swinging sea-lamp I saw every bit of available wall-space hung deep with sea-boots oilskins and garments clean and dirty of various sorts
BTS It was the Wild the savage frozen-hearted Northland Wild
BTS Fool
BTS So violently did the Ghost pitch and toss and tumble that it was impossible for even the sailors to move about without holding on and several times after a cry of Now she takes it
BTS he asked after the due pause which words and setting demanded
BTS Not for nothing had he been exposed to the pitiless struggles for life in the day of his cubhood when his mother and he alone and unaided held their own and survived in the ferocious environment of the Wild
BTS At the end of the week as had been prearranged the telegraphers of Germany and the United States returned to their posts
BTS Habeas corpus I heard some one mutter just now
BTS You will not deny that you are the cause of it
BTS 'Tis old fat Louis I stand by an' trouble enough it'll be
BTS Besides it is as I have said the law
BTS Maud who had prepared me for disappointment and who had been sprightly and vivacious all day broke down as we landed in our own little cove
BTS In a flash Buck knew it
BTS Dr
BTS Why you spoke of sending the militia to the Philippines
BTS I took off my shoes when I gained the forecastle head and went noiselessly aft in my stocking feet
BTS I am afraid you will cast off the masts in spite of me
BTS Then he heard a great outcry of snarls and yelps
BTS And then one night Matt reading to himself with moving lips and mumbled sounds was startled by a low whine from White Fang
BTS at all
BTS Out of it he had made a magnificent deer-park where over thousands of acres of sweet slopes and glades and canyons the deer ran almost in primitive wildness
BTS Four sleds pulled in from the river bed to the camp among the trees
BTS but he was a long time regaining his former position where he hung a pitiable object
BTS Not as long as our old hunters have anything to say about it
BTS He said the university needed ever so much more money this year than the state was willing to furnish
BTS Taking the rope and leading the way I passed through a glade of tangled vines and bushes that ran between two wooded knolls
BTS Yet the platitudes of the speakers that followed him were reported at length
BTS There was need for haste
BTS he asked
BTS But in the end Buck's pertinacity was rewarded
BTS But it was all of no avail
BTS We've made at least ten knots and we're going twelve or thirteen now
BTS morally and spiritually they had sickened him
BTS It was the leopard and the lion and the lion made all the noise
BTS Still hidden amongst the trees he paused to study the situation
BTS In passion to rend and destroy he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy
BTS He did not understand
BTS I thought she might faint outright but she controlled herself
BTS Thomas Mugridge backed away glaring as hatefully and viciously as I glared
BTS Everywhere the agents-provocateurs urged the people on
BTS In the midst of it he heard something
BTS There had been no useless gnawing
BTS Everhard is right he said
BTS For weeks at a time they would hold on steadily day after day
BTS I ceased waving my hand so that the shadow remained stationary
BTS Ten years ago
BTS Wickson and Mrs
BTS They were all about us thicker than I had ever seen them before in twos and threes and bunches stretched full length on the surface and sleeping for all the world like so many lazy young dogs
BTS At eleven o'clock I was no farther along
BTS A typical illustration of the internecine strife that permeated all society
BTS At the same moment I swayed as about to fall to the sand
BTS The spritsail flapped emptily and the boat righted to an even keel causing the two men swiftly to change position
BTS He did not seem to resent the delicate slurs
BTS The first successful great trust--almost a generation in advance of the rest
BTS They possessed greater mastery over matter than the gods he had known most powerful among which was Grey Beaver
BTS The fact that he had hands feet and a body shaped somewhat like mine constituted a claim which I could not ignore
BTS Grey Beaver had betrayed and forsaken him but that had no effect upon him
BTS One careless sniff had satisfied his mate and she trotted on to reassure him
BTS Prices were now deliberately pressed down to bankruptcy while the railroads with extortionate rates broke the back of the farmer-camel
BTS So he sat on his haunches conspicuously in an open space and challenged the hawk down out of the sky
BTS I hadn't a fair chance he began whining again
BTS We're only a couple of blocks now from where I got you out of that entrance
BTS And two days later when he returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the spoil he scattered them like chaff
BTS cried Mercedes throwing up her hands in dainty dismay
BTS A puff slightly stronger than usual struck us just then
BTS We may have made mistakes but if so very rarely
BTS There was a carriage waiting
BTS The taste of it was good
BTS You fellows have a snap
BTS He was a killer a thing that preyed living on the things that lived unaided alone by virtue of his own strength and prowess surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived
BTS And it was exertion
BTS Still I advanced steadily looking for him to turn tail at any moment and run
BTS It is the nature of the persecution
BTS Twice his teeth clipped together like the steel jaws of a trap as he backed away for better footing with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled
BTS Besides the law of meat there were a myriad other and lesser laws for him to learn and obey
BTS I noticed a black discoloration still faintly visible under Johansen's eye a mark of the thrashing he had received a few nights before from the sailor
BTS And so it was instead of in paradise that I found myself in the arid desert of commercialism
BTS The geese
BTS But the rose-colour swiftly faded
BTS A tree contracting in the cool of the night made a loud noise
BTS By the last guns the boats were bearing away slightly to the south'ard
BTS But there was one man amongst them who particularly enjoyed the sport
BTS She could not fly in the face of the gods who permitted him but that did not prevent her from making life miserable for him in petty ways
BTS Then she will not do any more work
BTS Being sled-leader was anything but gratifying to him
BTS There was movement in the doorways
BTS but he did it craftily when Francois was not around With the covert mutiny of Buck a general insubordination sprang up and increased
BTS It remained to him a white wall of light
BTS But my knee was bothering me terribly
BTS but Ernest opened his eyes looked at me and waved them aside
BTS Hammerfield sneered
BTS On the other hand the labor castes the members of the favored unions will strive to make their organizations into close corporations
BTS Bring a light
BTS Buck did not like it but he bore up well to the work taking pride in it after the manner of Dave and Sol-leks and seeing that his mates whether they prided in it or not did their fair share
BTS They yelped and howled under the rain of blows but struggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured
BTS The cause of it all as near as I could make out was that the man who was mate had gone on a debauch before leaving San Francisco and then had the poor taste to die at the beginning of the voyage and leave Wolf Larsen short-handed
BTS And during all this time free licence had been theirs from their masters to kill the things of the Wild
BTS But his reputation was made and from that day his name spread through every camp in Alaska
BTS But at the end of several minutes two dogs were struggling in the dirt and the third was in full flight
BTS It was reported that the defection of the Mercenaries in California had become so serious that half a dozen regiments had been disbanded and broken and that their members with their families had been driven from their own city and on into the labor-ghettos
BTS It would have smashed out a double row of spikes
BTS Many valuable relics have been found among which curious to relate is the smoke-consuming device of Biedenbach's mentioned in the narrative
BTS No it is a palace wherein there are many servants
BTS In the division of the joint-product capital wanted all it could get and labor wanted all it could get
BTS The creative joy I murmured
BTS Then it was that his lips half writhed into a snarl and the hair of his neck and shoulders involuntarily bristled while he half crouched for a spring his claws spasmodically clutching into the snow-surface for firmer footing
BTS and then at last after the travail of the centuries will it be the day of the common man
BTS You kick with your legs
BTS And for their less fortunate brothers and sisters the unfavored laborers the driven people of the abyss they cared nothing
BTS Watching my chance I stole five cans of the milk and that night when it was Louis's watch on deck I traded them with him for a dirk as lean and cruel-looking as Thomas Mugridge's vegetable knife
BTS It is not nice for me I added
BTS And here's a try at it
BTS He may be uneducated but he certainly knows how to express the significance of the written word
BTS I was exhausted and could go no farther
BTS He worked faithfully in the harness for the toil had become a delight to him
BTS And this I doubt not they will go on doing to the end of time
BTS On the other hand the whole thing was laughable and childish
BTS They dropped that private car when the papers came aboard
BTS Capital in all these countries has already consumed all it is able according to its nature
BTS As he neared her he became suddenly cautious
BTS Pray come down to earth and tell me precisely what you do mean by philosophy
BTS Numbers of the farmers impelled by an insane lust for the soil and willing to show what beasts they could become tried to escape expropriation by withdrawing from any and all market-dealing
BTS It was the trap ever the trap the fear of it lurking deep in the life of him woven into the fibre of him
BTS Among the travellers in my Pullman was comrade Hartman like myself in the secret service of the Iron Heel
BTS I asked
BTS But this failure to get possession was not the chief danger that Ernest had in mind
BTS The seals were thick the wind was dying away
BTS They stood side by side watching and listening and smelling
BTS Philip Ward the equally great philanthropist
BTS Though the rest of her sails were gone the jib backed to windward and the mainsail hauled down flat were themselves holding and holding her bow to the furious sea as well
BTS Francois knew he was behind all the trouble and Buck knew he knew
BTS You are fat with power and possession drunken with success
BTS He worked for Wickson in the stables near the hunting lodge
BTS Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment
BTS They have already walked upon my face father explained
BTS At any moment that soft confidence-inspiring voice might break forth in a roar of wrath that gentle and caressing hand transform itself into a vice-like grip to hold him helpless and administer punishment
BTS The sticks 'll stand it and you and I will have to though we've plenty cut out for us
BTS I could see a black fin cutting the water and making for him with greater swiftness than he was being pulled aboard
BTS he demanded certain of her answer a triumphant vindictiveness in his voice
BTS The paw with rigid claws curving like talons shot under the tender belly and came back with a swift ripping movement
BTS Because the politicians of the old parties will have nothing to do with your atavistic ideas
BTS In fact it was on Wickson's horses that we had ridden over Sonoma Mountain
BTS But it is the asylum that frightens me
BTS I asked
BTS But it was Dave who suffered most of all
BTS What can I do for you
BTS I regained the cabin with a store of jams sea-biscuits canned meats and such things all I could carry and replaced the trap-door
BTS I sold my house--my houses rather he said all my other possessions
BTS And then she found the thing for which she sought
BTS I'll try to tell you why not though the telling will be rather hard
BTS In point of fact the chief vent to this primal melancholy has been religion in its more agonizing forms
BTS He held on as if he were a precious thing a treasure beyond diamonds or rubies
BTS At first their bullets zipped harmlessly along the surface of the water on either side the boat
BTS But you're not a man
BTS It was no slight task
BTS She never regained them This was what the onlooking huskies had waited for
BTS Maud was looking on her face awed and frightened
BTS He did not permit it
BTS Through the door came a low anxious whine like a sobbing under the breath that had just grown audible
BTS What happened after that was very confusing
BTS Better years on the island than to die to-night or to-morrow or the next day in the open boat
BTS For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope
BTS Wolf Larsen alone remained
BTS but the poor wretch was weeping again over his misfortunes
BTS They are precious
BTS It was inevitable that Milton's Lucifer should be instanced and the keenness with which Wolf Larsen analysed and depicted the character was a revelation of his stifled genius
BTS It was cleverly done
BTS Harrison and Kelly however made such an attempt
BTS Bill grunted his disagreement with the diagnosis and lapsed into silence
BTS And there in so strange sepulchre his spirit fluttered and lived
BTS But for the stray brown on his muzzle and above his eyes and for the splash of white hair that ran midmost down his chest he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf larger than the largest of the breed
BTS and now that he looked at the sled itself the concrete fact with the regular team of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it the more impossible the task appeared
BTS I never seen a red wolf before
BTS This with the same care he deposited in the gutter
BTS I followed with a quaking heart
BTS For a long time after his rescue Buck did not like Thornton to get out of his sight
BTS The maids guided by trusty comrades were led away
BTS Down in the depths of me I had a feeling that I stood on the edge of a precipice
BTS Here it is Joy upon joy and gain upon gain Are the destined rights of my birth And I shout the praise of my endless days To the echoing edge of the earth
BTS If part of them escaped the vigilance of the oligarchs might be aroused so as to prevent the escape of the remainder
BTS P
BTS His lids lifted lazily as he asked the question and it seemed that the deeps were opening to me and that I was gazing into his soul
BTS Every effort was made by the Oligarchy to save him
BTS Of this last Buck was never guilty though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man and wagged their tails and licked his hand
BTS His chief contribution to science was his studies of the electron and his monumental work on the Identification of Matter and Energy wherein he established beyond cavil and for all time that the ultimate unit of matter and the ultimate unit of force were identical
BTS Her lips were blue with cold and she was hollow-eyed but oh how bravely her brown eyes looked at me
BTS Eight feet of the butt was above the rail and I was as far away as ever from getting the spar on board
BTS The same shirt and he hasn't had it off once in all this time
BTS I did it beautifully Garthwaite was lamenting to me
BTS White Fang was wise
BTS Punishment failed to break his spirit
BTS A boy was chopping frozen moose-meat with an axe and the chips were flying in the snow
BTS He had entered the fog to windward of the steamer and while the steamer had blindly driven on into the fog in the chance of catching him he had come about and out of his shelter and was now running down to re-enter to leeward
BTS Then ensued the great foreclosing of mortgages and enforced collection of notes
BTS But that was not all
BTS He became more morose and irritable and when camp was pitched at once made his nest where his driver fed him
BTS I've given you warning Cooky Wolf Larsen said and now you've got to take your medicine
BTS Because he's worth twenty thousand dollars a year to them that's what for
BTS There was a crunching of fragile bones and warm blood ran in his mouth
BTS It was a time of madness
BTS Take no notice of him I whispered
BTS but between each lift the stern fell and while the bow lazily climbed the next wave the line slacked and he sank beneath
BTS not three hundred yards away
BTS Then Wolf Larsen's other hand reached up and clutched the edge of the scuttle
BTS You do not live in the same locality with the working class
BTS The lash bit into him again and again but he neither whined nor struggled
BTS It would be better if you remained
BTS But they went away with vengeance unsatisfied
BTS You mean they think they're sure of us Henry objected pointedly
BTS The whole setting was wild and for the first time regarding this strange woman and realizing how incongruous she was in it I was aware of how much a part of it I was myself
BTS Nay I did more
BTS Rather did they tolerate him in a broad human way as one tolerates any creature evilly treated in the making
BTS The sled-dogs had forgotten his prowess
BTS Wolf Larsen went amidships and took the coil of the throat-halyards from its pin
BTS These emissaries of the Iron Heel disguised themselves as artisans farmers and farm laborers
BTS It was a heritage he had received directly from One Eye and the she-wolf
BTS But this was not done so easily as it is written
BTS It means that the United States is coming to own railroads in Brazil factories mines and lands in Brazil
BTS Without waiting for the boy's acceptance the captain turned to the sailor who had just finished the gruesome task of sewing up the corpse
BTS Just call up the firm Red 4451 I think it is and tell them what size and kind of glass you wish
BTS for the great Majority of his followers came over to us
BTS A day of clear weather might follow or three days or four and then the fog would settle down upon us seemingly thicker than ever
BTS It's all a mess
BTS The famine was over
BTS He Wickson a sordid money-grabber has the power to determine whether I shall or shall not teach in the university of the state
BTS And in the silence he asked again Well
BTS And now we shift from this particular process to the sum total of all industrial processes in the United States which includes the leather itself raw material transportation selling everything
BTS But what is a dog to know in its consciousness of madness
BTS And you shall sleep until luncheon
BTS We hove to and ran away hove to and ran away and ever astern the struggling patch of sail tossed skyward and fell into the rushing valleys
BTS He came out of a thicket and found himself face to face with the slow-witted bird
BTS This woman was a new type to him a different breed from any he had ever known and he was curious
BTS Henry indicated with his head a second pair and a third
BTS We mined the organization of the Iron Heel with our secret agents and the Iron Heel countermined with its secret agents inside its own organization
BTS E
BTS Concerning that night's ride the man spoke most eloquently for himself in a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water front
BTS I had not looked at it in that light the Bishop said naively
BTS It was necessary for us to practise until our assumed roles became real
BTS This wild stirring of yeasty life this terrific revolt and defiance of matter that moved perplexed and interested him
BTS He was so unlike the men of my own class so alien and so strong
BTS One reason was that he had fallen in love with Anna Roylston and the other was that he had become one of us
BTS As he sank back with it between his teeth he kept his eye on the sapling
BTS I know English and I know what you mean sir Johnson answered his flush deepening at the slur on his knowledge of the English language
BTS Mention was made in one or two of the papers that he had been overcome by his feelings
BTS I was trading
BTS An unseen and fearful revolution is taking place in the fibre and structure of society
BTS It was nearly out
BTS It was my father's name for my mother
BTS Irresponsibility had weakened him
BTS this patience belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food
BTS Maud held the turn on the windlass and coiled down the slack
BTS Furling the sail and lashing it securely about the mast boom sprit and two pairs of spare oars I threw it overboard
BTS Her brown eyes were like a startled deer's
BTS But just as he was going he turned and said Oh by the way while you are ruining your own peace of mind and I am ruining the Bishop's you'd better look up Mrs
BTS Everhard's social foresight was remarkable
BTS He was led into the inner cave-room and one of the young comrades left to guard him while we discussed the situation in the kitchen
BTS On one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength
BTS He chuckled and thereafter spoke no more
BTS Her hysteria became violent and she was helped weeping and laughing out of the room
BTS and the red-faced man his face now purplish with wrath and with arms extended overhead as in the act of hurling thunderbolts is shouting Shut up
BTS Perhaps the wind would haul a few points while we were at dinner and as I left the table he would say Mr
BTS Socialism has no more to do with the state of nature than has differential calculus with a Bible class
BTS There are in you all powers for good was Maud Brewster's answer
BTS The fierce winter had now descended upon us
BTS And if this was so then society was a lie
BTS CHAPTER III Wolf Larsen ceased swearing as suddenly as he had begun
BTS It was a strength I had not possessed a few months before on the day I said good-bye to Charley Furuseth and started for San Francisco on the ill-fated Martinez
BTS And then Jim Hall disappeared
BTS Then he traced the development of machinery and social organization so that to-day the producing power of civilized man was a thousand times greater than that of the savage
BTS Write and let me know how he gets along
BTS Shot in the breast was Hartman's report
BTS After all what censure could be put upon her
BTS Nothing remained to him but his thirst a prodigious possession in itself that grew more prodigious with every sober breath he drew
BTS I fed it shaving by shaving and sliver by sliver till at last it was snapping and crackling as it laid hold of the smaller chips and sticks
BTS I demanded angrily
BTS There is passion adoration in his eyes and he goes about in a sort of trance gazing in ecstasy at the swelling sails the foaming wake and the heave and the run of her over the liquid mountains that are moving with us in stately procession
BTS She rarely slept any more in the cave spending most of her time on the meat-trail and spending it vainly
BTS Now growl damn you growl he said as he patted the responsive head and rubbed the flattening ears
BTS These were scarcely fit weapons with which to meet the many merciless fangs
BTS There was furthermore another virtue in the fan-formation
BTS I refer to Mr
BTS The other unions will be ground out of existence--all of them
BTS Had this hole existed in the bed of a canyon a mile long or several miles long it would have been well known
BTS Pooh
BTS His diagnosis was correct however for he was seized with occasional sicknesses during which he vomited blood and suffered great pain
BTS He saw the silent circle with gleaming eyes lolling tongues and silvery breaths drifting upward closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past
BTS Day came and still the wind beat on our faces and the white seas roared past
BTS He had one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky enough to discover
BTS Come on Matt lend a hand the newcomer called the dog-musher who had followed him into the ring
BTS He had been out all night on the meat-trail and had but just then awakened
BTS and father had only laughed at him for his pains
BTS He fled away to Grey Beaver behind whose protecting legs he crouched when the bitten boy and the boy's family came demanding vengeance
BTS whoa
BTS He's a wolf
BTS All the while I had been apprehensive concerning my own predicament
BTS The stir of the life that was in him the play of his muscles was an unending happiness
BTS It never emerged
BTS During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat
BTS Their business was to toil and toil mightily in the traces
BTS Then boost him
BTS It was his old fighting trick
BTS By me
BTS all these he must let alone
BTS It was not the thinking and the speculation that led to the voyages of discovery
BTS There are more sailors than there are ships on the sea for them more workers than there are factories or machines for them
BTS I had been making of her a creature goddess-like and unapproachable
BTS At last he fell toppling backward exhausted
BTS Morning found him too weak to travel
BTS At first he was unable to drag himself along and Beauty Smith had to wait half-an-hour for him
BTS The mother ptarmigan was in a fury
BTS The captain or Wolf Larsen as men called him ceased pacing and gazed down at the dying man
BTS White Fang's natural impulse was to eat it
BTS Whether you do or think you do it's the same thing
BTS Jim Hall believed that the judge knew all about it and was hand in glove with the police in the perpetration of the monstrous injustice
BTS He pulled when he could
BTS I have seen him a score of times at table insulting this hunter or that with cool and level eyes and withal a certain air of interest pondering their actions or replies or petty rages with a curiosity almost laughable to me who stood onlooker and who understood
BTS Should 'a seen 'im
BTS Yet all were more like skeletons than full-bodied wolves
BTS But here was a dog that kept at a distance dancing and dodging here and there and all about
BTS I know I know she waived my protest
BTS Aren't you
BTS He had forgotten how to shift for himself
BTS He alone endured and prospered matching the husky in strength savagery and cunning
BTS Troop-trains
BTS You are not sure of it
BTS He'll have to learn to walk again said the surgeon
BTS When White Fang was nearly five years old Grey Beaver took him on another great journey and long remembered was the havoc he worked amongst the dogs of the many villages along the Mackenzie across the Rockies and down the Porcupine to the Yukon
BTS One Eye scooped out mouthfuls of the blood-soaked snow and chewed and tasted and swallowed
BTS He never could forgive the way his father had been malformed--the sordid lies and the petty thefts he had been compelled to in order to put food in his children's mouths
BTS These openings grew in size the segments diminished
BTS For the first time I began to divine that something terrible was about to be enacted what I could not imagine
BTS You jes' shut up now an' go to sleep an' you'll be all hunkydory in the mornin'
BTS Never
BTS And now we come to the point
BTS Nor could I attack such a creature who had but to twist my arm to break it
BTS Even then White Fang was not premature
BTS And there a century and a half ago originated the modern proletariat Ernest continued
BTS for at that moment a man passing along the sidewalk stopped and glanced in at us
BTS The explosion was ready for the flash of powder and countless agents of the Iron Heel including me either on the ground or being sent there were to supply that flash
BTS You're right Bill he concluded
BTS They aped their husbands and talked in the same large ways about policy and the duties and responsibilities of the rich
BTS He had committed what was to him sacrilege sunk his fangs into the holy flesh of a god and of a white-skinned superior god at that
BTS There must be men and cruisers to protect them from the seal-hunters
BTS He was also puzzled
BTS Do you know what happens to men who say what you've said about my slop-chest and me
BTS He gave no reason but his motive was obvious enough
BTS He interrupted her when she gave the lines And her eyes should be my light while the sun went out behind me And the viols in her voice be the last sound in my ear
BTS Strangling suffocating sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other dragging over the jagged bottom smashing against rocks and snags they veered in to the bank
BTS The middle class is a wobbly little lamb between a lion and a tiger
BTS He was sitting on the side of his bunk the whole pose of his figure indicating utter dejection and hopelessness
BTS She became a pest to him like a policeman following him around the stable and the hounds and if he even so much as glanced curiously at a pigeon or chicken bursting into an outcry of indignation and wrath
BTS Hump he said becoming cognizant of the fascinated gaze I bent upon him this beats whisky and is where your Omar misses
BTS And you know also how I crept about and avoided him I contended gaily
BTS This unexpected addition to his worriments in finding places for the progeny of his petroleum and their progeny and their progeny's progeny was too much for the equanimity of a man without a digestion
BTS And they said it was all the fault of the machines
BTS One by one I was at the masthead and saw the six boats disappeared over the bulge of the earth as they followed the seal into the west
BTS The tears were running down his puffed and discoloured cheeks and his face was drawn with pain
BTS You don't get no coffee Henry announced
BTS Pretty indeed to be caught there like a rat
BTS The courts interpret the Constitution and the courts as Mr
BTS But your example is unfortunate
BTS Chapter III
BTS With a flaming brand in each hand he sprang to the edge of the fire
BTS The other nodded and asked How about the back
BTS It was strange meat different from any she had ever brought before
BTS A new wistfulness was in her face but it was not the wistfulness of hunger
BTS We talked for hours over single stanzas and I found him reading into them a wail of regret and a rebellion which for the life of me I could not discover myself
BTS The blot of smoke which indicated the Macedonia's position had reappeared
BTS He did not hesitate a moment
BTS This obscure reference applies to a blind negro musician who took the world by storm in the latter half of the nineteenth century of the Christian Era
BTS She asked no further questions and I vouchsafed no remark devoting myself to Wolf Larsen's command which was to make her comfortable
BTS The Law of Club and Fang Buck's first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare
BTS I agree with you heartily he answered
BTS but he did not know that for he knew no other world
BTS And there were dogs everywhere that snarled at him and that he must not attack
BTS We squared away and ran for it
BTS Then he became angry--tonic angry
BTS The Appeal to Reason was a weekly and its regular circulation amongst the proletariat was seven hundred and fifty thousand
BTS I was invited father announced
BTS What is the cause of the merriment
BTS We spoke of it and he said that he had never been so healthy in his life
BTS And bringing them over the air-line--that means business
BTS and every act White Fang now performed was based upon the feeling that the white men were the superior gods
BTS In the nature of Arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should not drag one sled and that was that one sled could not carry the food for fourteen dogs
BTS He whetted it up and down all day long
BTS He got them or got away himself untouched in either event
BTS You bet was the reply
BTS Won't some of you help
BTS but in moments like this I regret my unbelief
BTS I slept only cat-naps
BTS You wouldn't find him Hump
BTS I too was busy trying to reason out how he was aware of the existence of so intangible a thing as a shadow
BTS Have you ever considered where you will stand when the great trusts themselves combine into the combination of combinations--into the social economic and political trust
BTS Familiar in varying degree with the sea they took me as a sort of joke
BTS The barranca is the site of the ancient right of way that in the time of private property in land ran across the holding of one Chauvet a French pioneer of California who came from his native country in the fabled days of gold
BTS They scorned accessories such as wigs and beards false eyebrows and such aids of the theatrical actors
BTS What can I do without her help
BTS Thornton rapped Hal's knuckles with the axe-handle knocking the knife to the ground
BTS Among the terriers he stalked imperiously and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored for he was king king over all creeping crawling flying things of Judge Miller's place humans included
BTS At any rate it is only so much more clinching evidence for my book
BTS On all sides there was a rending and crashing of wood and steel and canvas
BTS It is a year Grey Beaver since she ran away spoke a second Indian
BTS I ran to the side waving my arms and shouting Lady Mine ahoy
BTS This was the beast to be stamped upon and the highest duty of the aristocrat was to stamp upon it
BTS Columbus sailed to find a new route to the Indies
BTS The sea-water was streaming from him
BTS The force with which they struggled was vividly impressed on me
BTS So come to-night
BTS Ernest considered this announcement for a moment and then said and his face was very grave withal there was a sombre wrath in it There is more behind this than a mere university ideal
BTS The manner in which they were beaten was unique and logical and simple
BTS These deposits are saved for old age for sickness and accident and for funeral expenses
BTS Especially were they cast out when their preaching became tainted with socialism
BTS The horror of it drove me out on deck
BTS The great tea-pot was still in my hand
BTS Outside the household there was even more for White Fang to learn
BTS Forgotten save once when old One Eye stopped for a moment to lick his stiffening wounds
BTS There was continual bickering and jangling
BTS but with the melting of the snow and the opening of the streams the Indian camp had moved away and that source of supply was closed to him
BTS Wickson and Mr
BTS Time and time again he tried for the snow-white throat where life bubbled near to the surface and each time and every time Spitz slashed him and got away
BTS You know I was travelling to Japan for my health she said as we lingered at the fire after dinner and delighted in the movelessness of loafing
BTS but all the currents had gone counter to those to which he now abandoned himself
BTS but the next day and for many days to follow they broke their own trail worked harder and made poorer time
BTS What's the matter
BTS This is a dilemma that interferes somehow with the aim of creation and the only way out as it seems to you is to destroy that which takes from you your profits
BTS It was not until in the last century that Lorbia the brilliant Italian scholar stumbled upon it quite by chance during his researches in the Vatican
BTS His voice and expression changed
BTS Further he was more directly connected with the Wild than they
BTS I tried to rise but struck my head and was knocked back on hands and knees
BTS We had scarcely filled away it seemed when the fog thinned abruptly and we were again in the sunshine the wide-stretching sea breaking before us to the sky-line
BTS Then I turned my face against Ernest's breast and wept softly for the Cause that was lost
BTS We had not changed much from primitive man despite the war automobiles that were sliding by
BTS In the morning Thomas Mugridge being duly bribed the galley is pleasantly areek with the odour of their frying
BTS That surely is bad doctrine I cried
BTS Oh ho he said a nest of revolutionists--and quite a hornet's nest it would seem
BTS Because I am solid and stolid and selfish
BTS They did not know him for what he was a lightning-flash of slaughter
BTS My experiences were confined to them
BTS It is our strength
BTS It was weird strangely weird
BTS We overhauled them about two feet to their one
BTS In fact nothing no matter how remotely eatable had escaped them
BTS The eighteen months that followed was perhaps the happiest of my life with Ernest
BTS She seemed mastered by the verb to stitch
BTS Far from it
BTS They called me 'scab
BTS The company employs very efficient lawyers you know
BTS This delicate aristocratic-featured gentleman was a dummy director and a tool of corporations that secretly robbed widows and orphans
BTS He looked over the remainder of the team with a speculative eye that summed up instantly the salient traits of each animal
BTS This happened during the time when calamity had overtaken us in our own affairs
BTS Watch
BTS What do they own or through dominant ownership control to-day
BTS The name and its magic signified nothing to him
BTS For me he tore the sham from the face of society and gave me glimpses of reality that were as unpleasant as they were undeniably true
BTS It was cowardly but what else could I do
BTS He may sink the vessel or set fire to it
BTS An' 'twas me you hit of course Kelly seconded his face brightening for the moment
BTS It might have been a lost soul wailing had it not been invested with a certain sad fierceness and hungry eagerness
BTS Have you made up your mind
BTS Now had not the moose come down to drink had not Mit-sah been steering out of the course because of the snow had not Kloo-kooch sighted the moose and had not Grey Beaver killed it with a lucky shot from his rifle all subsequent things would have happened differently
BTS Colossal profits
BTS Failing there he hammered it into the dogs with a club
BTS This surplus it was compelled to dispose of abroad and what of its colossal plans it needed money
BTS The hand descended
BTS And the possessors were not of the idle rich
BTS The record of your stupidity is there in the books your own books that you never read
BTS Still no one objected
BTS I cannot say that my very first impression of him was favorable
BTS The wolves had been driven back
BTS This lost mine was steeped in tragedy and shrouded in mystery
BTS It's a shame after working hard all day that we cannot have an uninterrupted night's sleep I complained after supper
BTS I had not thought you so great a coward I sneered
BTS Give us more pay and charge it to the public was the slogan of the strong unions
BTS But we could not keep up
BTS And still we walked in immediate quietude
BTS Beaten on their chosen field they were ripe to seek revenge by means of political action
BTS While it packed the socialist meetings with mad enthusiasm it was impervious to the wiles of the old-party politicians
BTS The next day we did no work
BTS And thus it was that I passed into a state of involuntary servitude to Wolf Larsen
BTS But Wolf Larsen cried out to him Cooky you've got to hustle to-night
BTS She is a poor but honest woman
BTS How do you measure it
BTS With the overthrow of Lip-lip White Fang could have become leader of the pack
BTS He took his head in his two hands and rested cheek on cheek
BTS They are made to carry the weak the sick and the aged
BTS He sat up on his haunches and ki-yi'd
BTS Her sharp menacing cry sent the hair bristling along his back and he snarled warningly at her
BTS It penetrated deep into the land and the tide setting in drifted us under the shelter of the point
BTS The sky had clouded and the train rushed on like a sullen thunderbolt through the gray pall of advancing day
BTS A quarter of a mile inland we came upon the holluschickie sleek young bulls living out the loneliness of their bachelorhood and gathering strength against the day when they would fight their way into the ranks of the Benedicts
BTS I was glad to get out of the detestable presence of the cook and to be off my feet
BTS For the second and last time in his life he had barked and made himself understood
BTS After that they threw stones no more and White Fang understood and was satisfied
BTS Slowly the mast swung in until it balanced at right angles across the rail
BTS I never used to be she answered
BTS But what scenes of hell the Bishop's eyes had seen I knew not for he seemed too stunned to speak about them
BTS And then it happened
BTS It is all in the books he said
BTS Chance travellers might praise or pet him
BTS Ambulances were not for such as he
BTS But woe the dog that outran his fellows in such pursuit
BTS He was mastered by the sheer surging of life the tidal wave of being the perfect joy of each separate muscle joint and sinew in that it was everything that was not death that it was aglow and rampant expressing itself in movement flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move
BTS This memory is as distinct and sharp as that of any picture I have seen
BTS Other comrades took charge of me
BTS Strange to say and I noted it all once Wolf Larsen's features showed no such evil stamp
BTS He ignored my sarcasm saying Suppose I clap the hatch on now
BTS I rose swiftly to my feet and I know quite unconsciously assumed a defiant attitude
BTS When he moaned and sobbed it was with the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers and the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery
BTS Sail had been made in the early watches so that the Ghost was racing along under everything except the two topsails and the flying jib
BTS Garthwaite had not returned
BTS Sure answered O'Brien thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of Matthewson's
BTS The men outside shouted and applauded while Beauty Smith in an ecstasy of delight gloated over the ripping and mangling performed by White Fang
BTS But on the other hand you are being eaten up in turn by the bigger dogs wherefore you squeal
BTS The pair paused and surveyed the locked dogs
BTS Instinctively he leaped into the fire and as he leaped he felt the sharp slash of teeth that tore through the flesh of his leg
BTS never attacked till he had first defended that attack
BTS And there came a day when the hawk's shadow did not drive him crouching into the bushes
BTS It was during this period between the death of Johansen and the arrival on the sealing grounds that I passed my pleasantest hours on the Ghost
BTS Not only the hand but the hard wooden paddle was used upon him
BTS Now and again men came strangers who talked excitedly wheedlingly and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater
BTS The thing to expect of them was the unexpected and for this he must be prepared
BTS for there was no telling what Wolf Larsen might do
BTS And when released he sprang to his feet his mouth laughing his eyes eloquent his throat vibrant with unuttered sound and in that fashion remained without movement John Thornton would reverently exclaim God
BTS He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days in the Northwest when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins packed flat And that was all no hint as to the man who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets
BTS You can never cure a chicken-killer
BTS but in time the blood became so widely diffused that it ran in the veins practically of all Americans
BTS His mother and fear impelled him to keep away from the white wall
BTS I saw seven
BTS How many cartridges did you say you had left
BTS They saw him marching out of camp but they did not see the instant and terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the secrecy of the forest
BTS As Berkeley himself attested his metaphysics didn't work
BTS Slacking away on the boom-tackle and hoisting an equivalent amount on the shears-tackle I brought the butt of the mast into position directly over the hole in the deck
BTS Get your palm and needle and sew the beggar up
BTS And as usual he is unpractical
BTS Besides Johansen was missing
BTS Then between them mother and cub they ate the blood-drinker and after that went back to the cave and slept
BTS If you only knew
BTS She was even pleased
BTS Because I'm buying
BTS We are all caught up in the wheels and cogs of the industrial machine
BTS CHAPTER IX THE MATHEMATICS OF A DREAM In the midst of the consternation his revelation had produced Ernest began again to speak
BTS What'll I put on his feet sir
BTS The seal of his dependence on man had been set upon him in that early day when he turned his back on the Wild and crawled to Grey Beaver's feet to receive the expected beating
BTS Watch out next for the suppression of the socialist press and socialist publishing houses
BTS Laughter had affected him with madness made him frantic with rage
BTS This famine was not a long one but it was severe while it lasted
BTS But the Bishop in spite of the gentleness and purity of his spirit was possessed of guile
BTS The sailors assembled in a fearful group just outside the forecastle scuttle and watched and listened
BTS As it was he never had a chance to kill them
BTS Oh not that I'm afraid of you not that I'm afraid of you he hastened to add
BTS Every time we try to break out something happens and we're turned back
BTS Do you remember when England owned so much of our railroad bonds
BTS And how much for one that's all chewed up like this one
BTS He did not know anything about this law for it was no generalisation of the mind not a something acquired by experience of the world
BTS Here were many men and countless dogs and Buck found them all at work
BTS The insurance companies charge the highly trained chemists that handle explosives eight times what they charge the workingmen
BTS Our points of view and outlook on life at least were very alike
BTS I shouldn't mind if they cut my flesh with stripes or burned me at the stake or crucified me head--downward
BTS And petty and selfish
BTS And you won't find another publishing house in the country to touch it Ernest said
BTS And still later when we became assured of the perfect security of the place a small house was erected
BTS I laughed bitterly to myself and seemed to find in Wolf Larsen's forbidding philosophy a more adequate explanation of life than I found in my own
BTS You see the Chicago slaves are all killed
BTS John Thornton and Buck looked at each other
BTS Still I pulled holding what I gained each time with a double turn until the next slap gave me more
BTS You have behaved like foolish little schoolboys what with intruding ethics and the thunder of the common politician into such a discussion
BTS by spells my right side seemed going to sleep sometimes arm or hand sometimes leg or foot
BTS Buck learned easily and under the combined tuition of his two mates and Francois made remarkable progress
BTS he cried
BTS Then the wind slowly died down
BTS The men were all on deck and busy preparing their various boats for the season's hunting
BTS Its wild water defied the frost and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held at all
BTS This it was the screaming of the women that most tried my nerves
BTS Buck had been purposely placed between Dave and Sol-leks so that he might receive instruction
BTS until to be our original selves would require a watchful and strong exercise of will
BTS It was a strange and frightful spectacle the small bunk-lined space the floor and walls leaping and lurching the dim light the swaying shadows lengthening and fore-shortening monstrously the thick air heavy with smoke and the smell of bodies and iodoform and the inflamed faces of the men half-men I should call them
BTS His hand went out to mine and as I shook it heartily I could have sworn I saw the mocking devil shine up for a moment in his eyes
BTS Her lover was in one of the three disloyal regiments
BTS I walk always now he said and a blush was on his cheek at the thought of the time when he rode in his carriage as though it were a sin not lightly to be laid
BTS You beat the air with your arms
BTS For him to resent such reproof was equally unexpected to her and she sprang upon him in snarling indignation
BTS Can you explain it
BTS In some way he must have escaped
BTS My father was a great man
BTS They assimilated the aristocratic idea from the moment they began as children to receive impressions of the world
BTS He had merely intimated his displeasure in his pride believing that to intimate was to command
BTS As she squared off more and more escaping from the side pressure she righted herself and broke her deck like a whale's back through the ocean surface
BTS All the wastage of meat such as the frozen chips belonged to the dog that found it
BTS Possibly this appearance was due to the weariness of the slender neck unable properly to support so great a burden
BTS If I need your assistance I'll call you in
BTS Evading the guards in the nighttime while all were asleep he blew the Pertonwaithe palace into atoms
BTS It could sell still at a slight profit when we were selling at actual loss
BTS We'll stand watches just as they do on ships
BTS I fell to the floor feeling very faint while he sat down lighted a cigar and watched me as a cat watches a mouse
BTS Ol' Villan had a dog once that run away with the wolves Bill cogitates aloud
BTS Calvin and the rest of the dairymen
BTS Immortality is a thing without beginning or end
BTS At the Rink Rapids two native huskies Teek and Koona were added
BTS But the moment he left the protection of the fire the boldest wolf leaped for him but leaped short
BTS but I was appalled at the thought that Maud must die
BTS This certitude was shown by the whole pack
BTS Then began a fire fight
BTS I had never been so brutally treated in my life
BTS I had not dreamed such wretchedness and misery existed in it
BTS They did not take kindly to trace and trail
BTS The next moment she was beside me
BTS The two men were compelled to run back to save the grub upon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team
BTS I was explaining why I testified at the trial the way I did--why I followed instructions
BTS and I have seen Leach fling himself upon Wolf Larsen without warning or provocation
BTS He must find meat
BTS That we can be drafted into the militia
BTS Pike robbed him of half a fish one night and gulped it down under the protection of Buck
BTS In turn he was an object of great curiosity to them
BTS Yet if I married I should not dare to have any
BTS To this Cherokee responded by vigorous wagging of the stump of his tail
BTS The warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness
BTS Ghent has taught the oligarchs how to do it Ernest said
BTS Environment served to model the clay to give it a particular form
BTS What the devil can you do with a wolf in California
BTS And still I hesitated
BTS But in the end the condemned man found his executioner in the form of a slender girl of seventeen Madeline Provence who to accomplish her purpose served two years in his palace as a seamstress to the household
BTS My name is Johnson sir the sailor boldly corrected
BTS No sooner did I get my freedom than my footsteps began to be dogged by the spies of the Iron Heel
BTS He was appalled
BTS On the other hand there was something about him that prevented great familiarity
BTS It cannot be Alaska

BTS It is no pleasant picture I can conjure up of myself Humphrey Van Weyden in that noisome ship's galley crouched in a corner over my task my face raised to the face of the creature about to strike me my lips lifted and snarling like a dog's my eyes gleaming with fear and helplessness and the courage that comes of fear and helplessness
BTS As for the vital industries everything prospered
BTS Left to myself I proceeded to cook breakfast on the oil stove and to prepare my home
BTS Then I discovered I had forgotten guy-ropes
BTS They were awed so still and large he stood and a moment's pause fell till the boldest one leaped straight for him
BTS It struck fairly nearly knocking the man over but he did not obey
BTS A man and a woman approached the master
BTS Of all our Fighting Groups this one was the most formidable ferocious and merciless
BTS But he was too morose and solitary for that
BTS But the refuge was very near
BTS Its bulk like that of some huge monster blocked our path
BTS To my surprise my clothes had dried on me and there seemed no indications of catching cold either from the last soaking or from the prolonged soaking from the foundering of the Martinez
BTS and it belonged to Buck as he clung to the flank of the herd retarding its march irritating the young bulls worrying the cows with their half-grown calves and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage
BTS I have seen him follow Wolf Larsen about with his eyes like an animal its keeper the while the animal-like snarl sounded deep in his throat and vibrated forth between his teeth
BTS The astounding thing about it was that they refused in almost identically the same language and this in face of the fact that I interviewed them separately and that one did not know that I had seen or was going to see the other
BTS The first sounds were those of a conflict between a bull and a wolf
BTS but Ernest controlled the tumult and made himself heard
BTS It's what I should have done at first I answered hugely disgusted with myself
BTS The sun of the small capitalists is setting
BTS He moulded it like clay twisted and distorted it like a Chinese puzzle into any design he chose
BTS He had just closed his hand with a steady pressure
BTS Mercy did not exist in the primordial life
BTS When his master had gone out White Fang turned loose and tore around the pen trying to get at the men outside
BTS Back and forth the bull tossed his great palmated antlers branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet within the tips
BTS White Fang will have to learn many things and it's just as well that he begins now
BTS I swear I saw it move with a strange writhing gesture of agony and with it lifted a head gory with nameless horror that gibbered at me and then lay down again and moved no more
BTS I must take it to her at once
BTS A sailor comes aft to take mate's place cabin-boy goes for'ard to take sailor's place and you take the cabin-boy's place sign the articles for the cruise twenty dollars per month and found
BTS She leaned against me so light and lily-frail and as her trembling eased away it seemed as though I became aware of prodigious strength
BTS she interrupted with that softness I knew full well to be insistence
BTS The sultry heat had become unendurable
BTS There was a long pause and every man at the table meditated in ways unwonted and profound
BTS His last word in striking contrast with the smoothness of his previous utterance snapped like the lash of a whip
BTS It was an all-powerful alliance but it was an alliance of the lion and the lamb as the middle class was soon to learn
BTS We must have been caught nearly at the centre of this circular storm and Wolf Larsen ran out of it and to the southward first under a double-reefed jib and finally under bare poles
BTS The first laughter of the evening went around the table and even Mr
BTS He looked his captain in the eyes and replied slowly I am going to get that boy down
BTS And still no more dead men I twitted Louis when Smoke and Henderson side by side in friendly conversation took their first exercise on deck
BTS Best of all perhaps he loved to lie near the fire hind legs crouched under him fore legs stretched out in front head raised and eyes blinking dreamily at the flames
BTS He shoved the slide part way back and rested his arms on it his body still in the companion-way
BTS But I was soon to know
BTS To use his own phrase it worked it produced effects
BTS But when he was at last unearthed and Spitz flew at him to punish him Buck flew with equal rage in between
BTS At a particularly bad spot where a ledge of barely submerged rocks jutted out into the river Hans cast off the rope and while Thornton poled the boat out into the stream ran down the bank with the end in his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge
BTS Their mother looked apprehensively in their direction
BTS Still protecting his throat and face with his torn and bleeding arm he tried to retreat to the barn
BTS White Fang looked up at the fort at the same time bristling and growling
BTS She was rushing around on her heel into the wind
BTS And like all succeeding wolves and wild dogs that had done likewise White Fang worked the covenant out for himself
BTS They had much to learn and in the meantime our Fighting Groups weeded them out
BTS It was very close
BTS Then he licked his chops in quite the same way his mother did and began to crawl out of the bush
BTS He walked less softly among the grown dogs
BTS but the relaxed fingers closed tightly and Grey Beaver roused himself
BTS he exclaimed and left the table at once to go on deck and into the steerage where the hunters were taking the first breakfast of their exile
BTS Here we lay in hiding all day and on the following night swept on by a flood tide and a fresh wind we crossed San Pablo Bay in two hours and ran up Petaluma Creek
BTS England managed to crush her own proletarian revolution and to hold on to India though she was brought to the verge of exhaustion
BTS All night with burning brands he fought off the hungry pack
BTS Leach one of the men who were murdered had moral courage to an unusual degree
BTS Come on
BTS He felt a little shame because of his weakness as though forsooth he were failing the gods in the service he owed them
BTS for Buck followed his trace into the water from which no trace led away
BTS It freezes the water to prevent it running to the sea
BTS It simply prolongs the fight this treachery of the big unions
BTS It was the snap of the whip
BTS But as often as he gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade the love for John Thornton drew him back to the fire again
BTS He did not know that he growled but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity
BTS The faro-dealer stooped down obediently and got a firm hold on Cherokee
BTS A mysterious change had taken place so mysterious a change that he was shocked wider awake
BTS But he interrupted passionately
BTS The source of the smoke must be very close to Wolf Larsen my mind was made up to this and I went straight to his bunk
BTS The governors of Colorado and Idaho are but executing the mandates of their masters the Plutocracy
BTS By you I answered steadily
BTS Life is an offence to it for life is movement
BTS Calvin answered gravely
BTS They remained in a circle about him and his fire displaying an arrogance of possession that shook his courage born of the morning light
BTS No one more out of environment could be imagined
BTS To be obedient to them was to escape hurt and make for happiness
BTS Scott opened his arms to her but kept his eyes on White Fang
BTS The I
BTS Simply by subsidizing the great unions
BTS CHAPTER XXIII THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS Suddenly a change came over the face of things
BTS Get into yer bunks now and shut yer faces
BTS for a heavy shoe whizzed through the semi-darkness and Mr
BTS Yes that's what I thought when everything went over the side
BTS His body was theirs to maul to stamp upon to tolerate
BTS Still he persisted
BTS He did not understand and I quickly learned that he did not know the poem
BTS I put three or four spokes over to counteract a sheer toward the wind on the part of the Ghost and then steadied her
BTS I gazed entranced till the boat ran into the wind and the flapping sail warned me I was not attending to my duties
BTS After a time White Fang heard strange noises approaching
BTS We could offer nothing but the satisfaction of being faithful to a noble ideal
BTS I say this is a pretty warm reception for a poor lone wolf from the Arctic the master said while White Fang calmed down under his caressing hand
BTS He was a philosopher at heart and he was no longer even angry
BTS Moss would never do
BTS ' From hidden points of vantage the family watched the performance
BTS Power
BTS There were no survivors
BTS With night came horror
BTS and he nodded his head
BTS But I did not yet have the harsh facts of life at my fingers' ends as Ernest had
BTS I gasped with the anguish and shock of it filling my lungs before the life-preserver popped me to the surface
BTS To himself only was he of value and to show how fictitious even this value was being dead he is unconscious that he has lost himself
BTS I had hoped for a peaceable victory at the ballot-box
BTS and yet I could not pull the triggers
BTS The Plutocracy accepted the challenge
BTS I saw nothing
BTS Disguise did become a veritable art during that period
BTS There was no telling what the outcome would have been for the third wolf joined the elder and together old leader and young leader they attacked the ambitious three-year-old and proceeded to destroy him
BTS He saw no human face spoke to no human thing
BTS I flatter myself that I maintained my composure under the keen eye of the oligarch but my heart was beating madly
BTS Three broken ribs one at least of which has pierced the lungs
BTS At once he became a thing of the wild stealing along softly cat-footed a passing shadow that appeared and disappeared among the shadows
BTS Right here I think entered the austere conscience of my Puritan ancestry impelling me toward lurid deeds and sanctioning even murder as right conduct
BTS The people what of their wretchedness and of their disappointment in all things earthly were ripe and eager for a heaven where industrial tyrants entered no more than camels passed through needle-eyes
BTS Do be careful she called after me
BTS And in this was portrayed the victory of the spirit over the flesh the indomitability and moral grandeur of the soul that knows no restriction and rises above time and space and matter with a surety and invincibleness born of nothing else than eternity and immortality
BTS It sounded like the gurgling of a brook over mossy stones in some quiet dell and the crooning song of it lured me away and out of myself till I was no longer Hump the cabin-boy nor Van Weyden the man who had dreamed away thirty-five years among books
BTS At such moments I felt strangely alone with God alone with him and watching the chaos of his wrath
BTS Asmunsen's answer with the cries of all the men at the table behind him
BTS Every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of friendliness
BTS When I turned around a moment later I saw the cabin-boy staggering to his feet
BTS The mate  But he did not finish
BTS Far from her intention her words were maddening me driving me on
BTS Oh yes I remember it now
BTS I know it is he said sadly
BTS It was a calm night
BTS We had greater capital
BTS He paused a moment and I saw his white hands clinch
BTS And I was alone floating apparently in the midst of a grey primordial vastness
BTS I found her fumbling at the wall of the after bulkhead and half leading her half carrying her I took her up the companion-way
BTS And I could not swim a stroke
BTS And this was due I believe first to habit
BTS The crunchin' of the bones wasn't nice was his answer
BTS Then you have not protested
BTS A little later I heard the stroke of oars growing nearer and nearer and the calls of a man
BTS We stood in the water to our knees as I bared my head
BTS Perhaps the situation was not hopeless
BTS Here is what is going to happen
BTS Calvin
BTS Only one thing was clear to him and that was that he had not got any damages
BTS He pointed his nose at the moon
BTS But after his first bellow Wolf Larsen made no noise
BTS the marvel of it
BTS But Colonel Ingram did not curse
BTS They looked upon themselves as wild-animal trainers rulers of beasts
BTS This suppression was performed secretly so secretly that at first we could not comprehend
BTS Kowalt
BTS So it was that politicians like Mr
BTS At times I thought of throwing myself on the mercy of Wolf Larsen but the vision of the mocking devil in his eyes that questioned life and sneered at it would come strong upon me and compel me to refrain
BTS Oaths rolled from his lips in a continuous stream
BTS And the whole table was aroused shaken alive from monotony and drowsiness
BTS Yes I have she answered slowly and I could have laughed aloud at his crestfallen visage
BTS The two remaining oars were quickly broken
BTS I shall never be able to trust him I averred and far less now that he is blind
BTS An hereditary servility no doubt was responsible
BTS I could hoist no more
BTS The traders of Europe had to find another route
BTS Now the grey cub had lived all his days on a level floor
BTS Immediately after such fights he had always been imprisoned again
BTS and nothing remained to Buck but to recover the bone
BTS There must be some big men on board Hartman concluded
BTS I shrugged my shoulders
BTS There were no newspapers no letters no despatches
BTS I too have a quarrel with you Mr
BTS Poor girl
BTS On that point you will be tongue-tied though you will talk wordily enough about other things
BTS for he never forgot the peck on the nose he had received from the first of that ilk he encountered
BTS And that something I shall call the Oligarchy
BTS You little knew what you were choosing I laughed
BTS The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield
BTS He had never seen water before
BTS They would stop and look at him point him out to one another examine him talk of him and worst of all pat him
BTS He would come running at the first sound of a steamboat's whistle
BTS The planet is only so large
BTS His clutch on life was too strong
BTS Also their effect was irritating for Cherokee began to growl very softly deep down in his throat
BTS I am sure that he can present things from a new point of view that will be interesting and refreshing
BTS When the young leader lay in the snow and moved no more One Eye stalked over to the she-wolf
BTS And here it was now and I was face to face with it
BTS They were howling at the very gates and sometimes he and the Factor paused from the game to listen and laugh at the futile efforts of the wolves to get in
BTS She nozzled him and caressed him and licked the cuts made in him by the weasel's teeth
BTS It was cleverly done
BTS As regards their political and governmental power I'll take that up later along with the political and governmental power of the whole middle class
BTS As with the running mate on the left she repelled these attentions with her teeth
BTS The hunters laughed from sheer relief
BTS The team stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line ready for the trail
BTS It is what comes when there is nothing wrong with one's digestion when his stomach is in trim and his appetite has an edge and all goes well
BTS But no living man had looted this treasure house and the dead were dead
BTS The wind had been momentarily increasing and the sun after a few angry gleams had disappeared
BTS Weedon Scott had set himself the task of redeeming White Fang or rather of redeeming mankind from the wrong it had done White Fang
BTS Old Mother Nature's going to get up on her hind legs and howl for all that's in her and it'll keep us jumping Hump to pull through with half our boats
BTS When they depart from this they sin
BTS For truly now he said I am feeding his lambs
BTS So White Fang could only eat his heart in bitterness and develop a hatred and malice commensurate with the ferocity and indomitability of his nature
BTS and no classification of the three greatest lawyers in the United States could have excluded him
BTS Calvin here launched out into a political speech in exposition of his views
BTS I indicted your class
BTS Spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again and from that moment Buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred
BTS Running at the forefront of the pack was a large grey wolf one of its several leaders
BTS I didn't know what broughams were made for but now I know
BTS You were once and able to eat me as you were pleased to phrase it
BTS Of course there was no hope for him not the slightest and he knew it as well as I but by the manhood that was in him he could not cease from fighting for that manhood
BTS When they want to do a thing in business of course they must wait till there arises in their brains somehow a religious or ethical or scientific or philosophic concept that the thing is right
BTS And he for all his grey years and sage experience behaved quite as puppyishly and even a little more foolishly
BTS And hand in hand with this in all precautionary measures in Chicago the Iron Heel was inconceivably careless
BTS And after all delight is the wage for living
BTS I would kill him for your sake
BTS Shackled he was hand an' foot with his mate
BTS The Bishop was aghast and my father chuckled
BTS and in the wall itself shored by strong timbers well drained and ventilated we excavated two small rooms
BTS We'll have the breeze on our quarter he explained to me
BTS He spoke out of a superconscious apprehension of them
BTS And that it was grave I instanced his statement that he intended to stay and die on Endeavour Island
BTS Biedenbach and three young men who had been living in the refuge were out and over the mountain heavily armed and prepared for anything
BTS He sniffed the bodies curiously
BTS Again he commanded White Fang to go home
BTS And that unconsumed surplus sold abroad becomes what we call our favorable balance of trade
BTS But behind him was Dave likewise straining backward and behind the sled was Francois pulling till his tendons cracked
BTS All the old memories and associations died down again and passed into the grave from which they had been resurrected
BTS In the Northland he had evidenced his fealty by toiling in the harness
BTS Look at him now
BTS I found a light kedge anchor in the fore-hold where such things were kept
BTS We both laughed and then went seriously to work constructing the plan whereby we were to step the masts of the Ghost and return to the world
BTS Night had fallen when we made our first change of engine and I walked down the platform for a breath of fresh air and to see what I could see
BTS Perrault looked at his watch and swore
BTS Least of all would I have expected again to meet this man Joseph Hurd
BTS And the regular troops had cause
BTS Therefore against your strength the government will turn the regular army the navy the militia the police--in short the whole organized war machinery of the United States
BTS but it was this same way that White Fang knew it
BTS Not that he was to be praised for it
BTS Scott I'll make free to say you're seventeen kinds of a damn fool an' all of 'em different an' then some
BTS He sketched the economic condition of the cave-man and of the savage peoples of to-day pointing out that they possessed neither tools nor machines and possessed only a natural efficiency of one in producing power
BTS I noticed a private car on the rear
BTS Ask him something that requires no for an answer I suggested
BTS It was not the citizens of Girard that composed the mob
BTS The average dog was accustomed to the preliminaries of snarling and bristling and growling and the average dog was knocked off his feet and finished before he had begun to fight or recovered from his surprise
BTS No answer is necessary Mr
BTS Ah my dear sir Ernest smiled I thought you were disqualified
BTS Whereupon the cub covered its fangs and sank down submissively while the hand returning rubbed behind his ears and up and down his back
BTS It seemed as though his features had frozen into a diabolical grin at the world he had left and outwitted
BTS The next moment she was in my arms weeping convulsively on my shoulder while I clasped her close
BTS and by poverty is meant that condition in life in which through lack of food and adequate shelter the mere standard of working efficiency cannot be maintained
BTS Regularly each morning after he had finished his breakfast she performed her self-appointed task till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for Thornton's
BTS More tormentors Buck decided for they were evil-looking creatures ragged and unkempt
BTS He talked softly and soothingly with a gentleness that somehow somewhere touched White Fang
BTS The situation was bitter and bloody
BTS Wolf Larsen gave them little time for thought
BTS A man who tried to smuggle it in would lose his job
BTS but when he touched her neck gently with his muzzle she snapped at him with such quick fierceness that he tumbled over backward and cut a ridiculous figure in his effort to escape her teeth
BTS I worked seventeen years in them mills an' I've took notice that most of the accidents happens just before whistle-blow
BTS But he still lived a public life in a cage surrounded by curious men
BTS His mother's movements were restricted to the length of a stick and by the length of that same stick was he restricted for he had not yet got beyond the need of his mother's side
BTS Her mate had slowly relaxed from his crouch and was watching her
BTS This puzzled me
BTS If it were not for this life would be dead
BTS It was there or not at all that the Macedonia could hope to catch us
BTS I returned to Wolf Larsen's bunk
BTS She's a-comin' I tell you and it'll be sheets and halyards stand by all hands when she begins to howl
BTS Small waves with spiteful foaming crests continually broke over me and into my mouth sending me off into more strangling paroxysms
BTS The Church shall not be dumb
BTS Well well
BTS He ate the meat and nothing happened
BTS Really Hump I don't know
BTS that legacy of the Wild which no animal may escape nor exchange for pottage
BTS He could not be angry
BTS That's all right old fellow you just run along home ran the talk
BTS He was plainly perplexed and he came back again pausing a dozen feet away and regarding the two men intently
BTS It was dark and he could not see it but he recognised it by the touch
BTS And don't you think your miserable life worth the price
BTS I cried
BTS Who then controls the government
BTS My imagination ran riot and still I could not sleep
BTS and it would have seemed that his mental development was well-nigh complete
BTS Daylight was yet three hours away though it was already six o'clock
BTS Out of his puniness and fright he challenged and menaced the whole wide world
BTS I stood motionless a roll of antiseptic cotton in my hand unwinding and spilling itself down to the floor
BTS No sir I  But Wolf Larsen had turned away with a snort of disgust leaving the sailor rubbing his eyes with surprise at having been let of so easily
BTS More and more soldiers were arriving and in the jam we were unable to get away
BTS Anyway I'm goin' to sleep
BTS At another time Spitz went through dragging the whole team after him up to Buck who strained backward with all his strength his fore paws on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around
BTS And by that old fossil
BTS We were lying head to north-west and it was his intention to jibe over all with the first puff
BTS As I helped Maud over the rail and felt her form close to mine it was all I could do to keep from crying out I love you
BTS CHAPTER XXII THE CHICAGO COMMUNE As agents-provocateurs not alone were we able to travel a great deal but our very work threw us in contact with the proletariat and with our comrades the revolutionists
BTS We were creating a new art and we had much to discover
BTS This was the favourite trick of the wolf breeds to rush in upon him either directly or with an unexpected swerve in the hope of striking his shoulder and overthrowing him
BTS But you can't mean it
BTS And following upon it the teamsters' strike had been broken
BTS Then added with the whimsical smile I adored but I am only one small woman
BTS They are afraid of this Ghost Dog for it has cunning greater than they stealing from their camps in fierce winters robbing their traps slaying their dogs and defying their bravest hunters
BTS But I saw not the deck but where the deck should have been for it was buried beneath a wild tumbling of water
BTS Weedon Scott had believed that he was quick enough to avoid any snap or slash
BTS All the gods started up the steps to enter the house
BTS The dogs he had fought with did not fight that way
BTS That by your own word is why you are no longer in the dairy business
BTS Let us see
BTS And what were we to do
BTS With the bursting open of the door the noise of their howling had increased tremendously
BTS Long-distance funerals is somethin' you an' me can't exactly afford
BTS An angry lot of men boat-pullers and steerers as well as hunters swarmed over our side
BTS You talk verbosely in antiquated terminology of your love of liberty and all the while you wear the scarlet livery of the Iron Heel
BTS Of all men it was now the property of Mr
BTS There must have been more men in the conspiracy to murder the captain and mate for by the sounds I knew that Leach and Johnson had been quickly reinforced by some of their mates
BTS There was a magic in words greater than the conjurer's art
BTS the railroad would have had to assume all the risk which you so obligingly assumed for it
BTS Yet in accordance with Ernest's test of truth it worked
BTS In all this the farmers are without power
BTS Du Bois the present librarian of Ardis is a lineal descendant of this revolutionary pair
BTS Bill spoke gravely and slowly with no hint of the anger that was raging within
BTS He promised to call upon us again
BTS I could not sell out
BTS The man you shot he is I hope
BTS He appeared waiting for the words with which to express the thought that was in him and finally went on
BTS We know and well we know by bitter experience that no appeal for the right for justice for humanity can ever touch you
BTS And thus I thought even as we chaffed each other's appearance until we arrived ashore and there were other things to think about
BTS Mediocrity you see has its compensations
BTS But history tells of slaves who rose to the purple I chided
BTS The more his opponents grew excited the more Ernest deliberately excited them
BTS It would be a mercy to kill him Scott insisted
BTS I could imagine he was speaking the thoughts of his own mind as he read to me and his voice reverberating deeply and mournfully in the confined cabin charmed and held me
BTS only could be heard the voices of the gamblers vainly offering two to one
BTS White Fang stood over the shin-bone bristling and menacing while Baseek stood a little way off preparing to retreat
BTS 'Ere 'e is sir the cook said
BTS Whatever they have done they have been hounded into doing
BTS Maud looked at me inquiringly as I emerged
BTS Then arose the throaty rumble I had heard before and a dozen men were on their feet clamoring for recognition from Colonel Van Gilbert
BTS After that well we would see
BTS and when with a final rub and scratch the man left him alone and went away all fear had died out of White Fang
BTS And it is well
BTS Speaker and bid them do their work
BTS One Eye ran ahead cautiously his mate at his heels
BTS That dog's too intelligent to kill
BTS He became very sick so sick that Matt was finally compelled to bring him inside the cabin
BTS Miss Brewster and myself
BTS was the captain's next demand this time of the hunters lounging about the companion-way
BTS But this boldness that I took to be presumption was a vital clew to the nature of Ernest Everhard
BTS Our comradeship was becoming tremulous I had mastered my love long and well but now it was mastering me
BTS In the meantime we talked and talked much to the disgust of the hunters who could not understand a word
BTS And so we loved and were happy
BTS I did not know what palaces were made for but now I have found a use for them
BTS Dr
BTS I could see the vessel being swallowed up in the fog
BTS Something suspiciously akin to moistness dimmed her beautiful eyes before she dropped them and partly turned away her head
BTS You'll find it knockin' about by the bitts Leach said sitting down on the edge of the bunk in which I was concealed
BTS But I think I'll leave the bulls alone next time
BTS Only the persecution
BTS Their standard of living fell
BTS As he struggled around the ring the fifty pounds of his foe ever dragging on his throat his anger passed on into panic
BTS There was food in plenty
BTS Then I went aft for orders
BTS His misty little mind had already made an unconscious classification
BTS So come on an' shyke
BTS Fully half their grub supply was gone
BTS You have no proof
BTS but a revolutionist I became and I was plunged into a whirl of happenings that would have been inconceivable three short months before
BTS Locked in the yard and there deserted by the master White Fang lay down and went to sleep
BTS And you wouldn't have it
BTS It is a miracle that you have survived
BTS They remembered only the latest which was his weakness and sickness
BTS Coarseness and savagery are the inevitable results
BTS He met Wickson accidentally on the street in San Francisco and he told Wickson that he was a damned scoundrel
BTS But it was too late
BTS But I no longer despaired in the old way
BTS Who's croaking now
BTS In fact I am waiting to hear the news from you
BTS He never looked at me that way all the time you was gone
BTS You are   I was on the verge of saying my woman my mate but glibly changed it to standing the hardship well
BTS He was held a prisoner in the sanitarium
BTS The oligarchs had protected themselves well
BTS You don't understand the game
BTS I went through high school he replied
BTS Lonely he had lived so far as his kind was concerned and lonely he would continue to live
BTS But wait till they get to cutting up iv jinks and rowin' 'round
BTS The middle class is a pygmy between two giants
BTS But the reporters I objected
BTS The deposits average more than one hundred millions a day
BTS They lived in more comfortable homes and in delightful cities of their own--delightful compared with the slums and ghettos in which they had formerly dwelt
BTS You have said a dozen of you to-night that socialism is impossible
BTS Many men had sought it
BTS Come in with the dogs at feedin' time
BTS But Leach took it quite calmly though blood was spouting upon the deck as generously as water from a fountain
BTS If we cannot sail away on the Ghost we may remain for years on the island for life even
BTS I have been in the thick of life so long that I am oppressed by the peace and quiet and I cannot forbear from dwelling upon that mad maelstrom of death and destruction so soon to burst forth
BTS But is the opposite true
BTS And you don't care a cent for what is best for the rest of labor
BTS But I'll stand my watch on board hereafter I blurted out a moment later
BTS He was a good worker an' never made trouble
BTS The left hand stumbled slowly and painfully across the paper and it was with extreme difficulty that we deciphered the scrawl
BTS During this period of his development he never knew a moment's security
BTS When I had finished the bed I caught myself looking at him in a fascinated sort of way
BTS And he didn't give me the dime much less the home and stock
BTS and more than a few there were who had never returned from the quest
BTS He made no noise
BTS I called repeatedly but was denied access to him
BTS His tufts of ears had become tassels his neck and shoulders were slashed in a score of places and his very lips were cut and bleeding all from these lightning snaps that were beyond his foreseeing and guarding
BTS He had miscalculated once but he would not be guilty of it a second time
BTS He would stand off at a little distance and look on while stones clubs axes and all sorts of weapons fell upon his fellows
BTS an' a piece at a time he went up a leg to-day an' to-morrow an arm the next day the head an' so on
BTS But of Johnson's grumbling at the slop-chest I knew nothing so that what I witnessed came with a shock of sudden surprise
BTS And finally I am convinced that he is the perfect type of the primitive man born a thousand years or generations too late and an anachronism in this culminating century of civilization
BTS Tyke 'im aw'y carn't yer
BTS The set-back to their hopes made them despairing and desperate
BTS Garthwaite held me by the arm and we pressed close against the front of a building
BTS That's another way of saying that you live up in the air
BTS For that matter high-strung and finely sensitive the ill treatment had flung him into a fever which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue
BTS It was an exclamation of surprise
BTS We will not reply to the bear in words
BTS This bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on July 30 1902 was the reply
BTS Your point of view she laughed
BTS They will build as the Egyptians and the Babylonians never dreamed of building
BTS Back he circled across the drive to the other lawn and again she headed him off
BTS Because of all this he hated the man
BTS There were days when he crept to the edge of the forest and stood and listened to something calling him far and away
BTS With help on the inside this was not difficult for in that shadow-world of secret service identity was nebulous
BTS That fool One Ear don't seem scairt much Bill said in a low tone
BTS The wives and daughters of these lesser oligarchs were legion and it was decided that I should assume the disguise of such a one
BTS We do not make the class struggle
BTS He was formally executed by the comrades in Milwaukee
BTS It was no light adventure this trusting ourselves in a small boat to so raw and stormy a sea and it was imperative that we should guard ourselves against the cold and wet
BTS He had evidently delayed reporting preferring to wait until he had brought things to a successful conclusion by discovering my hiding-place and capturing me
BTS He laid too great stress on what he called the class struggle the antagonism between labor and capital the conflict of interest
BTS At last I sank down on the sidewalk
BTS The Rockefeller bank--the National City Bank--is by itself far and away the biggest bank in the United States
BTS Little opportunity was given White Fang to see all this
BTS You ain't got me yet
BTS He was certainly capable of anything
BTS Yet I knew I must control myself for Maud Brewster's sake and I received my reward when her eyes caught mine for a fleeting second and they said as distinctly as if she spoke Be brave be brave
BTS And we could see that he was tonic-angry when he entered the room
BTS What do they do to the poor men who are like me
BTS There is the danger that he has sold us out or is going to sell us out
BTS but I got a whack at it jes' the same
BTS Ninety cents per week
BTS But sometimes straying off to the edge of the woods by himself he gave vent to his grief and cried it out with loud whimperings and wailings
BTS With the Judge's sons hunting and tramping it had been a working partnership
BTS What does the fool up an' say when the old man calls him Yonson but Me name is Johnson sir' an' then spells it out letter for letter
BTS Your hearts are hard as your heels with which you tread upon the faces of the poor
BTS As for the host of labor it has been in the dirt since history began and I read history aright
BTS and this was the only way that was now vouchsafed him of expressing the life that was in him
BTS He did it in a surge of rage
BTS And then boastingly We work from the time we are born until we die in my country
BTS I'm hitting the long trail old man where you cannot follow
BTS He looked at the potatoes spilling on his arm and at the small parcels on his other arm
BTS So great was it that Wolf Larsen himself did not dare heave to though he was being driven far to the southward and out of the seal herd
BTS The blows increased
BTS Surely there must be a hell for in no less place could it be possible for you to receive punishment adequate to your crimes
BTS Don't tyke all night about it
BTS But Matt failed
BTS They was put aw'y wet sir he vouchsafed explanation
BTS Curly rushed her antagonist who struck again and leaped aside
BTS You are as much mercenaries sincere mercenaries I grant as were the men of the Swiss Guard
BTS Fire away and do not forget that I here challenge you to give the answer that Colonel Van Gilbert has failed to give
BTS Pack up your kit and go for'ard into the fo'c'sle
BTS The youth of the race seemed burgeoning in me over-civilized man that I was and I lived for myself the old hunting days and forest nights of my remote and forgotten ancestry
BTS and I caught one glimpse of his face malignant and triumphant as his other hand compassed my body and I was drawn down to him in a terrible grip
BTS All right Thomas I said
BTS A cancer a tumour or something of that nature a thing that devours and destroys
BTS At present however she said after another slight pause I earn about eighteen hundred dollars a year
BTS Nor did he notice the open trap
BTS And yet it could not be
BTS she asked
BTS They made his movements a bit slow
BTS And there was so much yet to be done the sails for instance which practically had to be made over
BTS But the Iron Heel can't maintain so costly a programme forever I objected
BTS Besides the whole thing in popular slang was cooked up
BTS Jones the head of the ethical department in the University of California
BTS Once he roused with a start and hastily got the axe out from underneath the lashings
BTS The Fighting Groups constituted the one thorn in the side of the Iron Heel that the Iron Heel could never remove
BTS And yet while he was of massive build with broad shoulders and deep chest I could not characterize his strength as massive
BTS He never believed in jumping to conclusions
BTS But I thought also of my mother and sisters and pictured their grief
BTS Mit-sah resembled his father much of whose grey wisdom he possessed
BTS There is the word
BTS I'll be back were his parting words
BTS But out of this flux of society something is about to crystallize
BTS Watch out for Knowlton
BTS The enormousness of it appalled him
BTS After the first rush each time his snarl kept the three dogs at a distance but they trailed along behind yelping and bickering and insulting him
BTS The master's lips tightened as he faced the disagreeable task
BTS But three days was all Wolf Larsen allowed him in which to recover from the effects of the beating
BTS He exhibited them exposing beautiful white teeth in a grin as he did so and explaining that the wounds had come from striking Wolf Larsen in the mouth
BTS And so it went
BTS Then inside other fences were the particular domains of other gods
BTS Where is he
BTS The man on the Lady Mine laughed back through the megaphone
BTS But after the lynx all fighting ceased for White Fang
BTS And as never before he was ready to obey
BTS The Wolf is strong and it's the way of a wolf to hate strength an' strength it is he'll see in Johnson no knucklin' under and a Yes sir thank ye kindly sir' for a curse or a blow
BTS And then one day again out in the back-pasture he saw Dick start a jackrabbit and run it
BTS He could not understand what it all meant
BTS Public-spirited citizens took down their rifles and went out after him
BTS They're always having whist parties and such things back and forth
BTS To prevent the butts of the masts from slipping on the deck I nailed down thick cleats
BTS He had learned well the law of club and fang and he never forewent an advantage or drew back from a foe he had started on the way to Death
BTS Outraged labor continued to wreak vengeance on the traitors
BTS Hump runs the galley from now on and Cooky pulls in his horns
BTS many others had been sentenced to prison while thousands of the rank and file of the strikers had been herded into bull-pens and abominably treated by the soldiers
BTS When this had been done a few times he learned the law and after that observed it
BTS He was a good shot too and brought many a skin aboard under what the hunters termed impossible hunting conditions
BTS Poor blundering thief that he was always getting caught and punished he had none the less been a faithful worker
BTS This behavior on the part of the capitalist press was nothing new Ernest told us
BTS The man of him was not changed
BTS His primacy was savage and savagely he ruled administering justice with a club punishing transgression with the pain of a blow and rewarding merit not by kindness but by withholding a blow
BTS And there was much fun and delight
BTS Wolf Larsen sprang on deck and so swiftly that by the time we followed him he had pulled the steerage-slide over the drunken clamour and was on his way forward to close the forecastle-scuttle
BTS The pulpy remnant he dropped back into the pan and turned away and I had a sharp vision of how it might have fared with me had the monster put his real strength upon me
BTS For your mother
BTS The poor dears
BTS They got away I said cheerfully
BTS but the blood surged darkly across Smoke's forehead and he half opened his mouth to speak
BTS Ernest ignored the thrust
BTS but the expression of determination on her face did not relax
BTS He's bound to go on living somewhere somehow
BTS The Outside dogs whose digestions had not been trained by chronic famine to make the most of little had voracious appetites
BTS He is quite reasonable and fair in his calm moments and as he is calm now he will not deny that only yesterday he threatened my life
BTS hated him for that he fled always at the head of the team his waving brush of a tail and his perpetually retreating hind-quarters for ever maddening their eyes
BTS Reprisals were bitter and many plutocrats and army officers were murdered
BTS It was the last days they claimed the beginning of the end of the world
BTS Ernest's continued presence in Berkeley by the way was accounted for by the fact that he was taking special courses in biology at the university and also that he was hard at work on a new book entitled Philosophy and Revolution
BTS A column of thick acrid smoke the kind always made by black powder was arising through the open companion-way and down through it leaped Wolf Larsen
BTS Will you trust yourself to me for a journey of six hundred miles or so
BTS Get busy you American revolutionists
BTS He was too philosophic and simple to be vindictive and he lived too much in the world of mind to miss the creature comforts we were giving up
BTS The only outlet was north and north it went toward the lake driven on from east and west and south by machine-gun fire and automatics
BTS It was all a sad mistake
BTS But the machine killed her
BTS That is precisely what I say in my speeches to the farmers
BTS After that they ran side by side like good friends who have come to an understanding
BTS If he has liberty he may do anything
BTS I looked into his face
BTS And furthermore the working class can do better without you than with you
BTS What of the thin and rotten ice he had felt under his feet all day it seemed that he sensed disaster close at hand out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying to drive him
BTS It is a whim of mine to keep you aboard this ship where my piggishness flourishes
BTS Did you lock the front door
BTS CHAPTER XVII Strange to say in spite of the general foreboding nothing of especial moment happened on the Ghost
BTS Milk was raised a cent a quart
BTS Gold said Mr
BTS We can never get that anchor up in this narrow place once it has left the bottom I said
BTS Is it not then highly irrational to break the machine-loom and go back to the clumsy and more costly hand-loom method of weaving
BTS I got that much out of him
BTS Albert Pocock another of the notorious strike-breakers of earlier years who to the day of his death successfully held all the coal-miners of the country to their task
BTS They were doing the thing in style with fourteen dogs
BTS Neither side wants the destruction of the machines
BTS I shall never forget in that moment how instantly conscious I became of my manhood
BTS He was dazzled by it
BTS CHAPTER II THE MAD GOD A small number of white men lived in Fort Yukon
BTS It reminded me of Taine yet I knew the man had never heard of that brilliant though dangerous thinker
BTS Several times Thornton started as though to speak but changed his mind
BTS Injunctions were served on him
BTS But he was not destined to enjoy that bed
BTS How unusual
BTS Those men are cursing because their desires have been outraged
BTS There were days and nights when Ernest never closed his eyes in sleep
BTS The high wind blew from the north-west for twenty-four hours when it fell calm and in the night sprang up from the south-west
BTS We were squeezed out
BTS The log cabins he had known were replaced by towering buildings
BTS The mere sight of Beauty Smith was sufficient to send him into transports of fury
BTS They're not healthy here but I can't afford to send them away
BTS You must have seen what happened
BTS Look up the reporters that kept Jackson's case out of the papers and the editors that run the papers
BTS I've got my peepers on yer
BTS Therefore the hair stood up on end along his back and his lips wrinkled weakly in an attempt at a ferocious and intimidating snarl
BTS Wickson
BTS It was all automatic
BTS The men were looking for land at any moment this morning and the vessel should be in by night
BTS In reality he was attempting to warn me to throw my ashes over the lee side
BTS Pocock V
BTS But the squirrel was as badly scared
BTS Mockery shone in his eyes
BTS I seemed to know just what to do and how to do it
BTS Men were scurrying down the gang-plank to the shore
BTS He never got over it and it was delicious
BTS But the Mercenaries found it no easy task to cope with the people of the abyss and at the same time fight with the comrades
BTS I made certain that it contained the proper equipment of oars rowlocks and sail
BTS And then in an exuberance of joy I hardly know whether to be glad or not
BTS These three sails I gathered from the conversation were to be set immediately after breakfast
BTS But the strange schooner lost itself on the sky-line and we alone occupied the circle of the sea
BTS Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed skyward by the unwonted demand it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal
BTS Then approaching at right angles to the trail and cutting off his retreat they saw a dozen wolves lean and grey bounding across the snow
BTS There were live things and things not alive
BTS They did not fight
BTS His wild flight ceased abruptly
BTS In return he guarded the god's property defended his body worked for him and obeyed him
BTS Their leaders were executed for sedition or confined in madhouses
BTS While he went wild with happiness when Thornton touched him or spoke to him he did not seek these tokens
BTS CHAPTER XIV It has dawned upon me that I have never placed a proper valuation upon womankind
BTS Calvin acknowledged
BTS So fast had she been running that she rolled along now on her back now on her side as she struggled to stop clawing gravel with her feet and crying shrilly her hurt pride and indignation
BTS The din was frightful
BTS And you know that I would kill an unarmed man as readily as I would smoke a cigar he went on
BTS The Oligarchy is about to tread upon our faces--yours and mine
BTS She was snarling as she ran
BTS painful to be weak because of the penalties
BTS The wisest as well as strongest dog was the leader and the team obeyed him and feared him
BTS Johansen
BTS and to give him rest--just rest--and easement and forgetfulness for a tender space
BTS I--I warned you he faltered
BTS I shall prove if what you say is so that the Church has erred through ignorance
BTS Also the three days' rest brought the trouble I had foreseen
BTS Hal awoke one day to the fact that his dog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered
BTS May I bring you to hear him
BTS The days came and went but never the master
BTS The first time occurred when the master was trying to teach a spirited thoroughbred the method of opening and closing gates without the rider's dismounting
BTS But often a pause so gained lengthened out until it evolved into a complete cessation from the attack
BTS Well he would see to it that he never went down
BTS Its agents approached us with a club
BTS But the hunger-madness made them terrifying irresistible
BTS He waited
BTS I never realized before how many words could be spoken in three short hours
BTS Lucky for me he doesn't carry a searchlight Wolf Larsen said
BTS Then and not until then would he flash from his hiding-place a grey projectile incredibly swift never failing its mark the fleeing squirrel that fled not fast enough
BTS Also in writing to his employer Matt devoted a postscript to White Fang
BTS He did not rest
BTS He had made no noise yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense his presence
BTS Here is one hundred dollars' worth of leather
BTS He held that it did that it could swim the moment it was born
BTS That was all
BTS Again the knife was raised and Wolf Larsen would have surely died had she not stepped between
BTS Just wait till he gets a glimpse iv yer mugs to-morrow the gang iv ye he chuckled
BTS The grey cub would have died and there would have been no story to write about him had not the she-wolf come bounding through the bushes
BTS I was thrown flat on the wet deck and before I could scramble to my feet I heard the scream of the women
BTS and a third seven hundred
BTS Their hair already betrayed the reddish hue inherited from their mother the she-wolf
BTS I could have cried with joy as I noted Ernest's increasing uneasiness and impatience
BTS One kiss more before they come
BTS The breakfast was a success and we sat about the fire much longer than enterprising explorers should have done sipping the hot black coffee and talking over our situation
BTS The Trust could put milk upon the market more cheaply than we
BTS There is wild talk of cannon aboard and of strange raids and expeditions she may make ranging from opium smuggling into the States and arms smuggling into China to blackbirding and open piracy
BTS the Bishop queried with alarm
BTS That'll do Johansen Wolf Larsen said brusquely
BTS I ain't been trailed this way by wolves before but I've gone through a whole lot worse an' kept my health
BTS And it seemed to me that his eyes were strange not only the expression but the physical seeming as though the optic nerves and supporting muscles had suffered strain and slightly twisted the eyeballs
BTS It was said he had not seen his own feet in years
BTS Who's that mug
BTS Good
BTS Leach stood their fears and reproaches for some time
BTS Come get to work Doctor
BTS Louis whispered to him For the love iv your mother hold your mouth
BTS There was reason for it and none knew it better than she
BTS I ought to know
BTS but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing Billee and drove him to the confines of the camp
BTS It's ground floor and no good he explained as he helped me through the hole he had made
BTS The oligarchs have already developed caste among themselves
BTS From pain and sheer exhaustion I wept in the darkness secretly so that Maud should not know
BTS A clean space of deck showed where it had stood
BTS In acknowledgment of fealty he proceeded to take upon himself the guardianship of his master's property
BTS Ernest the Speaker all the members turned to see
BTS The whole long day was a blaze of sunshine
BTS A snappy breeze was blowing from the west with the promise of more wind behind it
BTS One of his feet slipped and one man groaned aloud
BTS Much more he said that would take too long to write but I shall never forget how he described the life among the revolutionists
BTS But you better speak soft with him
BTS And in that moment his eyes were just as steady and sure
BTS In this purplish light Wolf Larsen's face glowed and glowed and to my excited fancy he appeared encircled by a halo
BTS The great captains of industry the oligarchs had for the first time thrown their full weight into the breach the struggling employers' associations had made
BTS Those that didn't starved
BTS she exclaimed
BTS I struck the door of the state-room which had formerly been Mugridge's splintering and smashing the panels with the impact of my body
BTS It was in February 1912 that I first met him when as a guest of my father's at dinner he came to our house in Berkeley
BTS It seemed almost that they were scared by the vision of the times they had seen
BTS Inside
BTS His sliding gait had been deceptively swift but it was as nothing to the speed at which he now ran
BTS and what of the decisive defeat administered all along the line to the labor unions
BTS I asked with a helpless shrug
BTS But the opportunity did not present itself and they pulled into Dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come
BTS It was as though he were bursting with pent energy which must find an outlet somehow
BTS He rushed in and snapped and slashed on the instant without notice before his foe could prepare to meet him
BTS All right then he answered
BTS It had come at last love had come when I least expected it and under the most forbidding conditions
BTS He nodded agreement when I had given the definition
BTS And through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before
BTS He had given himself to Grey Beaver and to Grey Beaver he considered he still belonged
BTS By the joint effort of capital and labor one hundred dollars of value was added
BTS For several minutes this mid-air battle continued then died out
BTS It was planned that they should be delivered simultaneously
BTS The stout wood was crushed like an egg-shell
BTS She announced her condition by a long heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear then sprang straight for Buck
BTS Yet it was given him to discover a third way
BTS I noticed Miss Brentwood's shoulders moving convulsively and for the moment I was angry for I thought that she was laughing at Ernest
BTS and as a mother cat washes her kittens so she washed and cleansed Buck's wounds
BTS Summer arrived and dogs and men packed on their backs rafted across blue mountain lakes and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest
BTS Why shouldn't it with the splendid organization and new machinery its large capital makes possible
BTS I guess that'll fix them Wolf Larsen said rising to his feet
BTS A moment later when he had recovered himself he said I always insisted that wolf was a dog
BTS Scott queried eagerly
BTS They too have muscles of one kind and another made to grip and tear and destroy
BTS Sometimes this stroke was successful and a stricken dog rolled in the dirt to be pounced upon and torn to pieces by the pack of Indian dogs that waited
BTS Each day the sun rose earlier and set later
BTS He had hardly ceased reading when Louis put his head into the companion-way and whispered down Be easy will ye
BTS White Fang watched it all with eager eyes and when the tepees began to come down and the canoes were loading at the bank he understood
BTS The next day and the next we saw the galley smoke rising and sometimes we caught glimpses of him on the poop
BTS At irregular intervals whenever a fight could be arranged he was taken out of his cage and led off into the woods a few miles from town
BTS All intelligence was gone
BTS The Bishop's utterance was a violent assault upon the established morality
BTS The children welcomed White Fang with glad cries and ran to meet him
BTS You are perishing and you are doomed to perish utterly from the face of society
BTS With the exception of a few of the musicians and singers and of a few of the oligarchs all the great creators of the period whose names have come down to us were revolutionists
BTS His face in relation to the rest of him was prodigious
BTS Yes Mugridge was saying an' wot does 'is worship do but give me two years in Reading
BTS It was a monotonous life operating with machine-like regularity
BTS Temptation was the topic they had hit upon and from the few words I heard I made out that he was contending that temptation was temptation only when a man was seduced by it and fell
BTS You will understand I took advantage of the opportunity to say whatever part I take in what is going on and what is to come that I am compelled to take it if you and I are ever to get out of this scrape with our lives
BTS Times have changed since Christ's day
BTS I took up a pair of trousers and examined her work
BTS Neither of us spoke
BTS He never asked himself the question
BTS but this time I shouted in merriment as I danced about the beach bareheaded in mock despair
BTS Yes I'm going with you so you may as well secure the boat and arm me with a club
BTS He followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig
BTS They have been cut with a knife
BTS Throughout the day and as slowly and steadily as ever the wind increased
BTS Yes she said but now it no longer shackles him
BTS but they quickly became hired fighting men of the capitalists and ultimately developed into the Mercenaries of the Oligarchy
BTS The hand with fingers crooked and spread apart rubbed his stomach in a playful way and rolled him from side to side
BTS My heart was as lead
BTS Men felt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron and the odds went down to two to one
BTS Ernest warned
BTS What did he say
BTS You poor devil he said gently rubbing White Fang's ears and tapping his spine
BTS I flung his words at him
BTS On this sea a storm might blow up at any moment and destroy us
BTS White Fang could hear Grey Beaver's squaw taking part in the search and Mit-sah who was Grey Beaver's son
BTS They have become members of those unions through competition for place
BTS Look here Henry Bill said unconsciously lowering his voice to a whisper because of what he imitated
BTS Surely I answered
BTS My first thought was that a man who had come through a collision and rubbed shoulders with death merited more attention than I received
BTS he demanded
BTS Quite true Hump quite true
BTS and also I flattered myself that by look or sign I gave no advertisement of the love I felt for her
BTS O'Toole or McCarthy would suit your mug a damn sight better
BTS He had been listening at the galley door but he now came out ostensibly to fling some scraps over the side but obviously to see the killing he was certain would take place
BTS You don't know all the ways out
BTS The Appeal paid union wages
BTS I was bruised and sore and aching in every limb
BTS The blows came faster heavier more shrewd to hurt
BTS Not so I objected
BTS A couple of bounds a flash of teeth and a frightened squawk and he had scooped in the adventurous fowl
BTS Of course he was not present and of course his judges did not know that he was one of our men
BTS I can tell you this much We've not been asleep
BTS This was a different proposition from crouching in frozen fear while the unknown lurked just alongside
BTS I thought of that Bill answered gravely
BTS Pitched battles had been fought with the small armies of armed strike-breakers put in the field by the employers' associations
BTS You speak in purely materialistic terms she objected
BTS In the meantime the abysmal brute in Beauty Smith had been rising into his brain and mastering the small bit of sanity that he possessed at best
BTS The golden colour and the dancing lights were gone
BTS Ay ay sir was the cheery response as Johansen started forward
BTS The Ghost ploughed on her way
BTS I quickened my pace trying not to think the thoughts that formed unbidden in my brain
BTS Thus discontent was lulled and the proletariat robbed of its natural leaders
BTS Now
BTS It is a feeling a sentiment a something based upon illusion and not a product of the intellect at all
BTS He named the points of their illogic
BTS After a time the she-wolf began to grow restless
BTS Mail steamer he answered shortly
BTS But the effect upon White Fang was not to cow him
BTS D'ye want to look at 'em
BTS He too sat down and howled
BTS I felt myself turning sick in anticipation
BTS When a man was captured he was given fair trial and opportunity for defence
BTS Growling savagely White Fang sprang out of the corner overturning the boy and the girl
BTS There was no end to the strange things these gods did and he was always curious to see
BTS He was ahead of the record then and gaining day by day
BTS Asmunsen nodded
BTS Cherokee still holding his grip urged against him trying to get him over entirely on his side
BTS But the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save chivalrous
BTS and upon his meagre frame was deposited an even more strikingly meagre head
BTS One thing in this connection White Fang quickly learnt and that was that a thieving god was usually a cowardly god and prone to run away at the sounding of the alarm
BTS Wait till we take office in the spring we answered
BTS We haven't the least idea
BTS And then I saw there was nothing to fear
BTS Such was the scene as we came upon it
BTS Be true to your salt and your hire
BTS He fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into the sea and by this stream he killed a large black bear blinded by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing and raging through the forest helpless and terrible
BTS We were talking of Harris I said to Wolf Larsen
BTS There was an impolite and sneering scepticism in his words and manner that secretly pleased most of them at the table though it seemed to bother Bishop Morehouse
BTS Matt how much is a good sled-dog worth
BTS His smashing sledge-hammer manner of attack invariably made them forget themselves
BTS I demanded
BTS Hans promptly snubbed with the rope as though Buck were a boat
BTS This railroad magnate broke his word as a citizen as a gentleman and as a Christian when he granted a secret rebate and he granted many secret rebates
BTS ' There you are gentlemen American citizens and fellow-militiamen
BTS Piece-work she answered promptly
BTS and yet again in his very walk there seemed that suggestion of weakness and indecision
BTS He was gone
BTS Men were holding their breaths intensely unconscious of the fact
BTS We've got him
BTS Then they were gone astern
BTS Six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty terrible miles
BTS I'm agreein' with you was Matt's answer and again his employer was not quite satisfied with him
BTS Once he awakened and in an opening in the circle directly in front of him he saw the she-wolf gazing at him
BTS I was without confidence in the future extremely doubtful and yet I felt no underlying fear
BTS Hist now between you an' meself and the stanchion there this Wolf Larsen is a regular devil an' the Ghost'll be a hell-ship like she's always ben since he had hold iv her
BTS I asked
BTS It's springtime and you won't get any more cold weather the man replied
BTS They won't join in the next general strike
BTS In the same way he resented his mother being tied with a stick even though it was done by the superior man-animals
BTS Next by means of the shears I hoisted the main boom on board
BTS Now and again feet stamped overhead
BTS You have never considered moral rights in your dealings with others
BTS I looked at him the man who had been hurled down from the topmost pitch of life to be buried alive and be worse than dead
BTS I have since determined that a part of it was due to the man's personality but that the greater part was due to his totally different outlook
BTS In short the things he did were done because it was easier to do them than not to do them
BTS as the sled gained momentum he caught them up till it was moving steadily along
BTS How could I put into speech a something felt a something like the strains of music heard in sleep a something that convinced yet transcended utterance
BTS That explained it all
BTS Their bodies were covered with fur and soft-tanned leather
BTS It might have been worse he smiled
BTS She laughed and shook her head and held her hands up for inspection
BTS But Johnson looking on still continued his grumbling
BTS Like his first attack his second had been accompanied by serious disablement
BTS But it was a fizzle
BTS That night when I had finished an endless amount of work I was sent to sleep in the steerage where I made up a spare bunk
BTS He did not control the courts and the Sierra Mills did
BTS Bosh
BTS John Thornton asked little of man or nature
BTS I could feel my knee through my clothes swelling and swelling and I was sick and faint from the pain of it
BTS At this moment as he opened his mouth to speak puff after puff struck the schooner and pressed her side under
BTS But as I descended the companion stairs to clear the table I heard him shriek as the first bucket of water struck him
BTS partly in horror partly out of curiosity
BTS They violated their own natures yet they loved liberty and knew of no sacrifice too great to make for the Cause
BTS What has that to do with it
BTS And now we shall have breakfast I said
BTS The unknown had caught him at last
BTS Yet a bad effect was produced
BTS and I can see as I have seen in the past all the marring and mangling of the sweet beautiful flesh and the souls torn with violence from proud bodies and hurled to God
BTS He barely held his own one leap ahead of his pursuer
BTS I will take you on a journey through hell
BTS I can hardly move my hand
BTS It is fair
BTS but again as with the body the massiveness seemed to vanish and a conviction to grow of a tremendous and excessive mental or spiritual strength that lay behind sleeping in the deeps of his being
BTS Colonel Ingram
BTS The daily press
BTS What I need is a longer club
BTS Yet fear was in him
BTS The American Oligarchy was practically in possession of the world-market and scores of countries were flung out of that market with unconsumable and unsalable surpluses on their hands
BTS A singer in deeds
BTS Oh the wonder of the great trade-wind
BTS Please she managed to whisper and I could but obey
BTS The more fiercely he fought the more harshly society handled him and the only effect of harshness was to make him fiercer
BTS Trust me it will come right
BTS This body was made for use
BTS I too leaned upon the rail and gazed longingly into the sea with the certainty that sooner or later I should be sinking down down through the cool green depths of its oblivion
BTS This loneliness is bad enough in itself but to make it worse he is oppressed by the primal melancholy of the race
BTS Now it happened that Leach was one of the sailors told off to douse Mugridge after his game of cards with the captain
BTS That this dog and White Fang should come together was inevitable and for a week the anticipated fight was the mainspring of conversation in certain quarters of the town
BTS The Ghost suddenly changed her course keeping away and it came to me with a shock that Wolf Larsen was giving up the rescue as impossible
BTS Who is weak and fallible prone to error
BTS Thank you sir was all he said as he slipped back into the darkness
BTS Nothing miss
BTS An' didn't they have words or a ruction of some kind
BTS I never dreamed of such a thing Mr
BTS In ways it was indeed good that he was not flighty and imaginative
BTS Likewise he learned to romp with the master to be tumbled down and rolled over and be the victim of innumerable rough tricks
BTS He occupied an anomalous position preaching an emasculated socialism combined with a nondescript sort of petty bourgeois capitalism
BTS Ere he landed on his feet he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before
BTS Twice he fell over when half up and on the third attempt managed to rise
BTS He sprang upon Buck and twice his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone
BTS and several lesser luminaries in the field of morality and charity
BTS He did not playfully shake him as was his wont or murmur soft love curses
BTS Sometimes she would lift and send across some great wave burying her starboard-rail from view and covering her deck to the hatches with the boiling ocean
BTS He was the food and the sight of him excited in her the gustatory sensations
BTS His intention was to rest Dave letting him run free behind the sled
BTS My father's new-born interest in sociology and the dinner parties he gave would not permit
BTS I looked to my companion for enlightenment
BTS The local news was missing
BTS Many of them have ascribed the strength of the Iron Heel to its system of reward and punishment
BTS They were the lawful prey of any dog
BTS but he always waited was always there
BTS Even you laugh at the idea
BTS Strain
BTS I think I have one coming on now
BTS and I wish you'd leave me alone
BTS The Constitution especially states that the militia cannot be sent out of the country
BTS The hunters never more than roughly aware of the position of the ship nevertheless knew that we were close to the boundaries of the forbidden sea while Wolf Larsen's record as a poacher was notorious
BTS likewise was White Fang's fright
BTS It is cheaper so much cheaper to buy a general than to fight him and his whole army
BTS It's unhealthy you know
BTS The blood-longing became stronger than ever before
BTS I don't know she answered smiling at me
BTS Again I could not disguise myself as a proletarian and travel
BTS Straight aft he held to the poop and along the poop to the stern
BTS Henry he said
BTS Thomas Mugridge lives in mortal fear of him and is afraid to venture on deck after dark
BTS A few minutes later the mate came fumbling about in search of it but I returned it privily to Leach next day
BTS That is you and I will live aboard friendly or not with Wolf Larsen
BTS Nevertheless Nature had given him plasticity
BTS A peep at Wolf Larsen showed me that he had not moved
BTS In its own way it was preparing to set these millions to work but the way was not our way wherefore it had issued its orders that our bill should be voted down
BTS We rightly contended that any revolt on our part was virtually suicide for the whole Revolution
BTS No not that
BTS He was no longer to be disregarded and ignored as was the lot of puppies and as continued to be the lot of the puppies that were his team-mates
BTS I asked
BTS Well Johnson then damn you
BTS for a tiny man-animal took the other end of the stick and led Kiche captive behind him and behind Kiche followed White Fang greatly perturbed and worried by this new adventure he had entered upon
BTS A curious anecdote has come down to us of John Burns a great English labor leader and one time member of the British Cabinet
BTS I asked
BTS White Fang allowed all the members of the family to pet him and make much of him
BTS We sailed with a beam wind along the shore searching the coves with our glasses and landing occasionally without finding a sign of human life
BTS 'Elp
BTS So you've changed your mind
BTS It was not in the mate's province to go out in the boats and though I manoeuvred cunningly for it Wolf Larsen never granted me the privilege
BTS He was the soul of it and how can I possibly separate the two in thought
BTS The press of the United States
BTS And she was spirit first and always spirit etherealized essence of life calm as her calm eyes and sure of permanence in the changing order of the universe
BTS I asked
BTS Carrying the boom-tackle to the windlass I hoisted the mast nearly clear of the deck
BTS Our thoughts were deep and solemn and we spoke to each other scarcely above whispers
BTS He called them the holluschickie or something like that
BTS The scene often came back to Buck to trouble him in his sleep
BTS I know I know Bishop Morehouse interrupted with an agonized expression on his face
BTS Buck was glad to be gone and though the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it
BTS It was in Berlin that I met him where as an accredited international spy of the Iron Heel I was received by him and afforded much assistance
BTS And there I agree with you was Ernest's rejoinder
BTS But the expression of Wolf Larsen's face never changed
BTS But there will come a time-- When the combination of the trusts will control all legislation when the combination of the trusts will itself be the government Ernest interrupted
BTS he cried
BTS And here's what happened to her
BTS I am Man Man Man from the tingling flesh To the dust of my earthly goal From the nestling gloom of the pregnant womb To the sheen of my naked soul
BTS The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags fifty pounds to the bag and piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge
BTS We saw them to-day
BTS She shook her head incredulously
BTS As though from a great distance he was aware that he was being beaten
BTS Wolf Larsen asked a peculiar softness in his voice as though he were overwhelmingly curious to hear the unspoken word
BTS Many fragments of his work have come down to us while two of his greatest achievements Anticipations and Mankind in the Making have come down intact
BTS Even I found some relief in our change of living
BTS Mit-sah alone gathering firewood in the forest encountered the boy that had been bitten
BTS but when the moving shadow fell across his face I saw at once that he was susceptible to the impression
BTS It struck me that he was joyous in a ferocious sort of way
BTS But my heart smote me when we climbed aboard and looked at the havoc he had done
BTS The famine broke
BTS She never gave him a moment's peace
BTS Let us run them for ourselves
BTS She remained always between him and the way he wanted to go
BTS I could not get away from him
BTS And their wives are always in and out of each other's houses
BTS At the rear limped the weak members the very young and the very old
BTS No
BTS It means that the resources of Brazil are being developed
BTS I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand
BTS Both nose and tongue had been scorched by the live thing sun-coloured that had grown up under Grey Beaver's hands
BTS Pike the malingerer who in his lifetime of deceit had often successfully feigned a hurt leg was now limping in earnest
BTS Francois sat down and scratched his head
BTS Nature had been more generous to him than to the average animal that was all
BTS The outlook was black indeed and I went about my work with a heavy heart
BTS The Ghost seemed to start into life as she heeled to the first fill of her sails
BTS Weedon Scott smiled with a superior air gained his feet and walked over to White Fang
BTS for when Hartman had succeeded in withdrawing the bundle we found that it consisted of large printed sheets the proclamations of the revolutionists
BTS How d'ye find me aboard if 'twasn't that I was drunk as a pig when I put me name down
BTS His stout mittens temporarily protected his hands and he scooped live coals into the air in all directions until the campfire took on the semblance of a volcano
BTS At first he had been prone to turn upon his pursuers jealous of his dignity and wrathful
BTS The garment itself did not bear out the assertion nor did the accumulations of grease on stove and pot and pan attest a general cleanliness
BTS No I answered firmly
BTS but I was reprimanded
BTS he demanded
BTS somebody comin' our way he was saying
BTS Maud shook her head and there was reproof in her eyes
BTS The lynx-mother would have eaten him had she not herself been killed and eaten
BTS His lip curled in a swift sneer
BTS but he's breathin' all right
BTS Then you'll see
BTS He gave them facts always facts checked their excursions into the air and brought them back to the solid earth and its facts
BTS Not that he personally objected--oh no
BTS Guided by that instinct which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world Buck proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd
BTS Grey Beaver ordered meat to be brought to him and guarded him from the other dogs while he ate
BTS He received the word as if it had a familiar ring though he pondered it thoughtfully
BTS As it was he struck heavily on his side
BTS It burned me and I jerked my hand away
BTS Let's watch him and follow him if he hauls out
BTS It would be terrible if he were
BTS Is not this pessimism of the blackest
BTS It was also serious for I learned that he was capable of using it that under all his cowardice there was a courage of cowardice like mine that would impel him to do the very thing his whole nature protested against doing and was afraid of doing
BTS By the time they took position the mob was upon them and it looked as though they would be overwhelmed before they could get into action
BTS He held me from him at arm's length and stared about in annoyance and perplexity
BTS Mugridge sat down on the raised threshold to the galley and went on with his knife-sharpening
BTS Of such things he had not the faintest glimmering
BTS But he only laughed and seemed to enjoy it
BTS Like all the rest of humanity those two women are tied to the machine but they are so tied that they sit on top of it
BTS You damn beasts
BTS How's it strike you
BTS The terms were simple
BTS Life and death and the Cause were in the issue
BTS You tempted Cooky and he fell
BTS It seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins
BTS That's the keynote
BTS It had not been mighty enough to face the organized wolf-pack of society
BTS The face of Jim O'Brien a Mastodon King and old-time comrade caught his eyes
BTS and went down crying with fear into the embrace of the unknown
BTS At last it showed small and black on the horizon fully fifteen miles away
BTS Lashing the wheel I ran forward eased the fore and mainsheets took in on the boom-tackles and trimmed everything for the quartering breeze which was ours
BTS you may have to sail with me for a time he said quite softly with a silken threat that belied the softness as they moved slowly to comply and we might as well start with a friendly understanding
BTS The history of the eighteenth century is written Ernest prompted
BTS You understand
BTS Dear damp brown hair
BTS What if his lying down were a ruse
BTS The war-cloud hovered dark and ominous
BTS I'll get you out of this as soon as I can get a chance he assured me
BTS A cheap cotton shirt with frayed collar and a bosom discoloured with what I took to be ancient blood-stains was put on me amid a running and apologetic fire of comment
BTS It had welded into one compact political mass the whole of North America from the Panama Canal to the Arctic Ocean
BTS They're pretty thin
BTS We went up to him but he seemed unconscious breathing spasmodically
BTS The tooth of every dog was against him the hand of every man
BTS As for me as I said before I know that you not only cannot answer but that you will not attempt an answer
BTS To be was all that remained to him to be as he had defined death without movement
BTS Let us oust the present owners of the wonderful machines and let us own the wonderful machines ourselves
BTS Leach could have killed him but having evidently filled the measure of his vengeance he drew away from his prostrate foe who was whimpering and wailing in a puppyish sort of way and walked forward
BTS Water was a consideration and I robbed every boat aboard of its breaker
BTS He left me as suddenly as he had come springing to the deck with the weight and softness of a tiger
BTS I asked him
BTS A transformation came over me
BTS Days and nights of sleeplessness and anxiety had doubtless turned my head
BTS And what did the company do for him
BTS Ghent
BTS The shark a sixteen-footer was hoisted up against the main-rigging
BTS For he has what they have not purpose something to do and be done an all-absorbing end to strive to attain the desire to kill me the hope that he may kill me
BTS Hours passed before his head touched pillow and I had soothed him off to sleep
BTS He doubled it
BTS They move no more
BTS You get used to being hungry
BTS You are impotent
BTS To acknowledge your obligations before you die
BTS He toiled as few men ever toiled and all his lifetime he toiled for others
BTS But now it was different
BTS He declared a vendetta against all dogs
BTS The first rays of the sun streamed upon our backs as we climbed
BTS I doubt if one of them was interested in any business the total capitalization of which exceeded a couple of hundred thousand dollars
BTS I know he said quietly though his face was growing darker
BTS You nag worse than a woman
BTS We were now dead before the wind the boat far away and abreast of us
BTS Also his earnings were added to by the royalties from the small sales of his own economic and philosophic works
BTS It was true that they sometimes gave meat but more often they gave hurt
BTS The bull weighed over eight hundred pounds fully twenty pounds of meat per mouth for the forty-odd wolves of the pack
BTS Life isn't you mean he smiled
BTS There was no clew to that tragedy of the air
BTS I lost my head temporarily and dashed frantically about the steerage
BTS Wolf Larsen in large doses I murmured before and after taking
BTS She was not more than half a dozen feet away sitting in the snow and wistfully regarding him
BTS And now it had come
BTS Van Weyden I don't have to answer do I
BTS Do nothing or you will be destroyed
BTS They went protestingly but their voices were not loud
BTS It was he who directed the pack's course on the heels of the she-wolf
BTS Wickson spoke
BTS A moment later he had dived under the boat seized the keel in his mouth and was shaking the boat violently
BTS Always he was on the lookout for the trail of the gods where it might leave the river and proceed inland
BTS It was very secret I answered
BTS by W
BTS Wot you say Perrault
BTS This woman sleeping even now in the spare cabin was a responsibility which I must consider and the only rational thought that flickered through my mind was that I must do nothing hastily if I were to be any help to her at all
BTS White Fang went wild with rage
BTS Oh won't somebody get a knife
BTS The time passed by and he slept intermittently for hours
BTS The jaw the chin the brow rising to a goodly height and swelling heavily above the eyes these while strong in themselves unusually strong seemed to speak an immense vigour or virility of spirit that lay behind and beyond and out of sight
BTS Van Weyden he interposed with mock anxiety
BTS Automobiles fled past two three a dozen and from them warnings were shouted to us
BTS And come on
BTS In vain we tried to see him to have his case reconsidered or investigated
BTS He had a strong constitution
BTS There's no denyin' he thinks a hell of a lot of you Matt said
BTS He was homesick
BTS I had just the moments to spare if I were lucky to get in touch with some local leader before catching my train
BTS Eat them up
BTS The others sat down and howled
BTS It wasn't an agreeable task for him
BTS I reached quick and the belt wasn't all the way off
BTS I had to confess it to myself
BTS Women and children were carrying more sticks and branches to Grey Beaver
BTS I asked him
BTS William Randolph Hearst--a young California millionaire who became the most powerful newspaper owner in the country
BTS Can't afford to
BTS Hal had traded off his revolver so he took the axe and knocked Billee on the head as he lay in the traces then cut the carcass out of the harness and dragged it to one side
BTS Scott cried desperately at the crowd
BTS Then he raised his voice
BTS Do you know I am filled with a strange uplift
BTS Also dogs being so constituted in their mental ways the sight of him running away gave desire to run after him and a feeling that he ran away from them
BTS How God must have hated them that they should be tortured so
BTS But he was further the fiercest of the litter
BTS In vain I objected and denied
BTS In the fevered imagination of fear they thought they saw that was all
BTS She rolled him off his legs so that he could not run while she repeatedly ripped and slashed him with her fangs
BTS But no matter how Spitz circled Joe whirled around on his heels to face him mane bristling ears laid back lips writhing and snarling jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap and eyes diabolically gleaming the incarnation of belligerent fear
BTS I am to him no more than a toy and he values me no more than a child values a toy
BTS ' Did you notice how he began like a lamb--Everhard I mean and how quickly he became a roaring lion
BTS Here at the rear against the doors we were pressed by a panting gasping mass of creatures
BTS But they are in the air now to-day
BTS No more were they worried by slack times strike and lockout and the union label
BTS I sensed this in ways I knew not save that they were my woman's intuitions
BTS The footing looked good
BTS Then came the underfeeding
BTS Go
BTS The first and second headlands were directly in line with the south-west wind
BTS I commanded peremptorily
BTS The wagon-road became a wood-road the wood-road became a cow-path and the cow-path dwindled away and ceased among the upland pastures
BTS It stood back from the road half hidden among the trees through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides
BTS On other days they were unable to get started at all
BTS It is the best we can do if we wish to live
BTS Not mineself either
BTS Meynell
BTS What can I tell you
BTS Siberia lies off there I said pointing to the west
BTS I don't object to losing my money but I like to get a run for it anyway
BTS Ernest was with me and we could see that father was angry--philosophically angry
BTS I'm agreein' with you only
BTS He had had no headaches for weeks his eyes were clear blue as the sky his bronze was beautiful with perfect health
BTS and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life of the toughest
BTS She let her legs go limp like a spoiled child and sat down on the trail
BTS Their irritability arose out of their misery increased with it doubled upon it outdistanced it
BTS At the break of the poop he reeled raised one hand to his eyes with the familiar brushing gesture and fell down the steps still on his feet to the main deck across which he staggered falling and flinging out his arms for support
BTS but even that constitution could not keep the tired look out of his eyes
BTS Then some deep-water sailor from the waist of the ship lifted a rich tenor voice in the Song of the Trade Wind Oh I am the wind the seamen love  I am steady and strong and true
BTS the shoulders drooped with dejection and he uttered a deep sigh
BTS Then also the idea of the general strike caught the mood of the people
BTS It made a lot of smoke but hurt no one except me
BTS Between the explosions we could hear the rattle of the automatic pistols and rifles
BTS Nor did Timothy Donnelly long survive
BTS It might have been otherwise and he would then have been otherwise
BTS and here in advance I challenge you to show that my mathematics are wrong
BTS His was the luck of the beginner
BTS the beautiful
BTS and all this plus an experience gained in the fiercest of schools made him as formidable a creature as any that roamed the wild
BTS I caught father grinning into his napkin
BTS He's in with all the big bugs
BTS And to me they talked in fatherly ways patronizing my youth and inexperience
BTS He told it inimitably but it was the story of a failure
BTS He was not immoral but merely unmoral
BTS The moistness was in her old eyes again and she had to wipe it away before she could go on stitching
BTS The members were executed one at a time at intervals of three weeks and their bodies exposed in the labor-ghetto of San Francisco
BTS There are several copies of various editions in the National Library of Ardis
BTS The drooping canvas was not stirred and yet my face had felt the air and been cooled
BTS Behind it is the fine hand of Wickson and behind him the hands of greater men than he
BTS Lip-lip essayed to back away but White Fang struck him hard shoulder to shoulder
BTS CHAPTER XVI THE END When it came time for Ernest and me to go to Washington father did not accompany us
BTS but the sailors took pains to put me to rights Louis proving an especially good teacher and I had little trouble with those under me
BTS Weak and reeling I went out through the broken window and down the street seeking to escape instinctively and gropingly from the awful shambles
BTS As it was the situation was approaching a stage which I was afraid to consider
BTS but I saw the movement of her lips and knew
BTS I could hardly believe until the next incident occurred that it was the face of a man who could behave as he had behaved to the cabin-boy
BTS No one had gone below and no one was speaking
BTS The railroad knows my business just a little bit better than I do he said
BTS I gave one fish to each dog an' Henry I was one fish short
BTS while the rest of the crew lived the lives of dogs and were worked like dogs by their pitiless master
BTS One Eye approached carefully but hopelessly
BTS And then there arose before me another figure the Christ
BTS For a pair of critics we agree famously I laughed
BTS And if sight alone were not sufficient the cry of rage the intruder gave beginning with a snarl and rushing abruptly upward into a hoarse screech was convincing enough in itself
BTS And it is going up by leaps and bounds
BTS and then I will pay my passage from there home
BTS He growled and tried to push by them
BTS What if all the poor people should refuse to pay rent and shelter themselves under the American flag
BTS Your own authorities with one unanimous voice will prove you stupid
BTS He it was who had dragged me out and saved me
BTS I saw him looking anxiously about him and noted that Kelly who had come forward at the last moment was missing
BTS A mile northwest from the wooded knolls brings one to the site of Wake Robin Lodge at the junction of Wild-Water and Sonoma Creeks
BTS It did not protest as to-day it does not protest
BTS Listen to that will you
BTS Don't dast tackle me so long as I got that club handy
BTS Then I bethought me of the great yachtsman's knife he always carried and I came to him and spoke to him first softly then loudly
BTS The air was thick with flying wreckage detached ropes and stays were hissing and coiling like snakes and down through it all crashed the gaff of the foresail
BTS He did not love Grey Beaver yet even in the face of his will and his anger he was faithful to him
BTS Will you kindly explain what has so long puzzled wiser heads than yours
BTS He has lost nearly all the blood in his body
BTS An oath from Perrault the resounding impact of a club upon a bony frame and a shrill yelp of pain heralded the breaking forth of pandemonium
BTS It is the desire that decides
BTS He could obey orders and he was neither curious nor garrulous
BTS Six thousand of the militia mutinied
BTS The big wolves ate the little wolves and in the social pack Jackson was one of the least of the little wolves
BTS He too was bound upon the wheel
BTS The Cockney became more humble and slavish to me than even to Wolf Larsen
BTS he cried to Buck
BTS They gave up their lives for humanity no sacrifice was too great for them to accomplish while inexorable necessity compelled them to bloody expression in an age of blood
BTS There will be more shooting I am afraid than even I dream of
BTS I remember one man they dragged out of a heap who pleaded abjectly until a revolver shot cut him short
BTS We had won over the Grangers and in the spring a dozen states would pass into their hands by virtue of the elections of the preceding fall
BTS Thus the summer of 1912 witnessed the virtual death-thrust to the middle class
BTS I reckon you've called the turn Bill
BTS He is the creature of his desires and of the two desires he obeys the strongest one that is all
BTS The night yawned about him
BTS Wolf Larsen has also a reputation for reckless carrying on of sail
BTS Calvin promptly replied
BTS and 5 Moore Reid and Leeds known as the Rock Island crowd
BTS Ballingford being that the latter has made the God of the oligarchs a little more gaseous and a little less vertebrate
BTS Hammerfield spluttered
BTS A cruel thing happened just before supper indicative of the callousness and brutishness of these men
BTS He's all cut an' gouged underneath
BTS They had a sanction in their own class-ethic for every act they performed
BTS Though never permitted by his mother to approach that wall he had approached the other walls and encountered hard obstruction on the end of his tender nose
BTS We've been passing them all night
BTS Then there were long deep-drawn sniffs
BTS The trusts did not advertise
BTS Then and with black suddenness the boat would shoot clear through the foaming crest bow pointed to the sky and the whole length of her bottom showing wet and dark till she seemed on end
BTS His had softened during the many generations since the day his last wild ancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man
BTS Mr
BTS Dreaming to leave footprints on the sands of time
BTS They were violent
BTS He grinned when I handed it over yet it was a grin that contained more sincere thanks than a multitude of the verbosities of speech common to the members of my own class
BTS The blankets in the other bunk stirred irritably
BTS Hal cried Whoa
BTS He continued his plodding pursuit though once for the moment baffled he came to a full stop and blinked at the men who looked on at the same time wagging his stump of a tail as an expression of his willingness to fight
BTS All this in frankness to show my first impression after long denial of women in general and of Maud Brewster in particular
BTS of Ernest's was ringing in my consciousness
BTS she queried
BTS And when the club or whip fell upon them the spark fluttered feebly up and they tottered to their feet and staggered on
BTS You'll learn in time how to take care of your money for yourself
BTS He saw the movement or heard sound and responded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere seeing or hearing
BTS Temptation plays no part unless  he paused while grasping the new thought which had come into his mind unless he is tempted to remain sober
BTS No hard surface collided with the tender little nose he thrust out tentatively before him
BTS Not so simple a task for one man
BTS Once inside the little cabin I saw Ernest's face in the light
BTS At six o'clock when I served supper going on deck to get the food from the galley I saw Harrison still in the same position
BTS How we bathed our poor bodies in its delicious warmth reviving like bugs and crawling things after a storm
BTS I am still a bit of the ferment you see he wrote a little later
BTS It was a savage land the men were savage and the fights were usually to the death
BTS 'Elp
BTS Yes but you are not doing that I objected
BTS Again the rueful expression came on her face and again I smiled in a superior way
BTS I knew the run of the simple medicine-chest the Ghost carried and while I was heating water on the cabin stove and getting the things ready for dressing his wounds he moved about laughing and chatting and examining his hurts with a calculating eye
BTS This factory takes leather and makes it into shoes
BTS I tell you right now Henry that critter's the cause of all our trouble
BTS this joy of living
BTS Jim Hall said Judge Scott and father and son looked significantly at each other
BTS Thus he waited keeping perfectly quiet
BTS Three dogs could not drag the sled so fast nor for so long hours as could six and they were showing unmistakable signs of playing out
BTS Time and again and countless times we watched the boat luff into the big whitecaps lose headway and be flung back like a cork
BTS It was the endurance of his mind that kept him going
BTS His wildest dreams had not exceeded a hundred per cent
BTS With the simpler creatures good and bad are things simply understood
BTS There seemed a question in them this time and as before he looked at me over long
BTS Never mind that man she said pointedly
BTS It is their inborn heritage to strive to devour and to strive not to be devoured
BTS It affords a striking commentary of the times
BTS Call it that or anything you want to call it
BTS And that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling ages
BTS He had bought the ranch for beauty and paid a round price for it much to the disgust of the local farmers
BTS His voice sounded harsh
BTS I might have knowed it Bill chided himself aloud as he replaced the gun
BTS Only occasionally on the sidewalks were there stray pedestrians and these pedestrians did not loiter
BTS It was the Macedonia
BTS 'Tis the beast he is this Wolf Larsen the great big beast mentioned iv in Revelation
BTS She flushed quickly and prettily
BTS Buck did not attack but circled him about and hedged him in with friendly advances
BTS You'd better run up and loosen the topsails
BTS But the man had turned and was walking rapidly away
BTS I had just pointed them out to Hartman when a sheet of flame and smoke ran along that portion of the face of the building where the heads had appeared and the air was shaken by the explosion
BTS for when you do you are sure to override my authority
BTS Go to the cook and learn your duties
BTS Forever after Buck avoided his blind side and to the last of their comradeship had no more trouble
BTS in the morning when they yielded up the damp of the dew and relaxed they were pulled tight again and that was all
BTS His wonderful constitution kept him up
BTS Well Buck my boy he went on in a genial voice we've had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that
BTS But instead Buck's shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly away
BTS And then the next moment Pardon my sneer Bishop
BTS Give it us and we will be as gods
BTS Are we all agreed so far
BTS At once he became an enigma
BTS Say Bill
BTS Then let me explain
BTS Gosh
BTS Had he not been hungry himself White Fang might have gone with him and eventually found his way into the pack amongst his wild brethren
BTS Louis stood imperturbably at the wheel but I noticed the grouped sailors forward turning troubled faces in our direction
BTS I saw him go for'ard a little while ago
BTS Ernest shrugged his shoulders
BTS But Bishop Morehouse oblivious to all his eyes filled with his vision continued Oh sisters and brothers in this act of mine I find the solution of all my difficulties
BTS The shrouds were wet with moisture
BTS But the cub knew what it was and with a last long wail that had in it more of triumph than grief he ceased his noise and waited for the coming of his mother of his ferocious and indomitable mother who fought and killed all things and was never afraid
BTS Nevertheless with the exception of the ones that limped the movements of the animals were effortless and tireless
BTS It came to me that we were at the head of the column
BTS He thought you were going to injure me and he wouldn't stand for it
BTS But it is a revelation on the other hand
BTS Young dogs are bound to play and out of the exigencies of the situation they realised their play in this mimic warfare
BTS I never 'ad none was the Cockney's comment as he gazed with lustreless hopeless eyes into mine
BTS So I thought at the time
BTS All passiveness and unconcern had dropped from them
BTS How was it going to end
BTS When I had finished washing the dishes I cleaned the cabin stove and carried the ashes up on deck to empty them
BTS Once more Francois called and once more Buck laughed and kept away
BTS I drain the lees upon my knees For oh the draught is good
BTS So saying he put up his fists and started for me
BTS My heart leaped with gladness for I knew what he had in mind and I gave him the bearings west-north-west and five hundred miles away
BTS On deck I found the Ghost doing splendidly under her patch of canvas
BTS After a few minutes by the time the white men had got over their surprise the gang scattered
BTS Matt paused halfway down the gang-plank
BTS But he was not in the least disturbed by desire to find out the reason for the difference between his father and himself
BTS He tried it with the ball of his thumb or across the nail
BTS From beneath their feet rose always the subterranean rumbles of revolt
BTS Then I will return
BTS She quit her antics and quieted down for a long minute
BTS But at the right moment I passed the tackle to the Kanaka while Wolf Larsen did the same thing forward to Kerfoot
BTS And keep you I will
BTS And then when he shook hands with me
BTS The door swung open and he came forth
BTS He nodded his head again evincing even greater satisfaction than before
BTS I nearly met you once in Philadelphia some Browning affair or other you were to lecture you know
BTS Between us we picked them up and replaced them in the broken bag which he now held carefully in the hollow of his arm
BTS The machine with its human freight lifted in an upburst of smoke and sank down a mass of wreckage and death
BTS I could feel the quiet sneer through his words but demanded How can I get it back again
BTS In appearance and rhetoric he was old-fashioned but in imagination and knowledge and resource he was as young as the latest statute
BTS The fight was growing desperate
BTS CHAPTER VIII THE MACHINE BREAKERS It was just before Ernest ran for Congress on the socialist ticket that father gave what he privately called his Profit and Loss dinner
BTS One smash from the club was sufficient to convince him that the white god knew how to handle it and he was too wise to fight the inevitable
BTS To live
BTS was his retort
BTS The man sat down on his blankets in a crouching position
BTS The circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on his flanks
BTS They are hanging on your lips for that answer because they have no answer themselves
BTS though I could not quite rid myself of the idea that right conduct for me lay in killing him
BTS Look at them
BTS Gad sir
BTS What are you doing down there
BTS Down the cross street we could see a few soldiers still running
BTS but with a turn of the sheet and the application of my whole strength each time it slapped I slowly backed it
BTS There was nothing to stop you nothing that could stop you
BTS As the mob charged past the corner it had been swept at right angles and point-blank range by the machine-guns drawn up on the cross street
BTS A strip of scarlet cloth a bearskin twenty cartridges and Kiche went to pay the debt
BTS I knew it was coming
BTS At the head of the room Miss Brentwood introduced him to Colonel Van Gilbert and I knew that the latter was to preside
BTS Who's our
BTS It was a vain undertaking
BTS Though I suffer all deaths that a man can die To the uttermost end of time I have deep-drained this my cup of bliss In every age and clime-- The froth of Pride the tang of Power The sweet of Womanhood
BTS Here she comes
BTS Won't somebody get a knife
BTS He leaned out of the door
BTS No less an authority of the times than Carroll D
BTS There was plenty of food and no work in the Southland and White Fang lived fat and prosperous and happy
BTS Near the gang-plank Scott was shaking hands with Matt who was preparing to go ashore
BTS His most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a night in advance
BTS that destroyed San Francisco
BTS I remember another street with quiet buildings on either side and the panic that smote me into consciousness as again I saw the people of the abyss but this time in a stream that flowed and came on
BTS It was not so much White Fang's ferocity as it was his silence that unnerved the groom
BTS Oh that it may not be premature
BTS It stood up against me like a wall filling my lungs with air which I could not expel
BTS The strange god paused at the foot of the great staircase and listened and White Fang was as dead so without movement was he as he watched and waited
BTS He had a strong sense of justice and he soon became fired with a passion to redress wrong
BTS And one day catching one of his enemies alone on the edge of the woods he managed by repeatedly overthrowing him and attacking the throat to cut the great vein and let out the life
BTS No more would he conjugate the verb to do in every mood and tense
BTS The animal was certainly not cinnamon-coloured
BTS The voice of my companion brought me back to myself with a laugh
BTS Death Larsen
BTS The next instant he was grappling with Buck on the extreme edge while Hans and Pete were dragging them back into safety
BTS So I shall expect after breakfast to receive my first lesson
BTS Hammerfield snorted
BTS P
BTS But through it all I clung to the one idea I must get the jib backed over to windward
BTS He brought the Sierra Mills into court but he could not bring the books of the Sierra Mills into court
BTS For two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives
BTS Half of that was the dog-musher's judgment
BTS There lay the Ghost bow on to the beach her splintered bowsprit projecting over the sand her tangled spars rubbing against her side to the lift of the crooning waves
BTS Had he merely stood over the meat head up and glowering White Fang would ultimately have slunk away
BTS What of my impetus and the stunning surprise I clattered three or four steps along the deck before I could stop myself
BTS I shall develop the inevitability of the breakdown of the capitalist system and I shall demonstrate mathematically why it must break down
BTS These muscles were made to grip and tear and destroy living things that get between me and life

BTS The gods were all-powerful and a dog was no match against them

BTS Unlike man whose gods are of the unseen and the overguessed vapours and mists of fancy eluding the garmenture of reality wandering wraiths of desired goodness and power intangible out-croppings of self into the realm of spirit unlike man the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to the fire find their gods in the living flesh solid to the touch occupying earth-space and requiring time for the accomplishment of their ends and their existence

BTS Down the opposite side of the street tottered a wretched slave
BTS For it is my world my gorgeous world The world of my dear delight From the brightest gleam of the Arctic stream To the dusk of my own love-night
BTS They were to be loosed on the palaces and cities of the masters
BTS Though the novelty had not yet worn off the peaceful comportment of the seals had quieted my alarm
BTS It was evidently his intention to play with them a lesson I took it in lieu of a beating though a dangerous lesson for the frail craft stood in momentary danger of being overwhelmed
BTS One guess will do Ernest retorted
BTS To the consternation of his congregation his first sermon was quite similar to the address he had given before the Convention
BTS while sea and sun had tanned the naturally fair skin to a dark bronze which bespoke struggle and battle and added both to his savagery and his beauty
BTS It was a quiet moonlight night but I tossed restlessly and could not sleep
BTS Every fit workman in the United States will be possessed by the ambition to become a member of the favored unions
BTS into steamships and steamboats and telegraphy
BTS I had not been called Sissy Van Weyden all my days without reason and that Sissy Van Weyden should be capable of doing this thing was a revelation to Humphrey Van Weyden who knew not whether to be exultant or ashamed
BTS Oh yes I can I retorted
BTS Hartman and I agreed that it was useless to report ourselves to the local chiefs of the secret service
BTS But suppose the trusts win in this battle over the ownership of the machines and the world
BTS It was amusing
BTS It was evident that he had no suspicion of our presence when making the descent
BTS The silence was unbroken save by the cries of their pursuers that unseen hung upon their rear
BTS And he fled to Kiche raging at the end of her stick like an animal gone mad to Kiche the one creature in the world who was not laughing at him
BTS It may be noticed in passing that Wild- Water was originally called Graham Creek and was so named on the early local maps
BTS and he did not even murmur or change the expression on his face
BTS There must be some way she contended
BTS He shook his head slowly
BTS White Fang came to him not with a great bound yet quickly
BTS I am a Dane
BTS Leach he said you know I'm going to kill you some time or other don't you
BTS He threw his strength into one tremendous jerk
BTS I love animals
BTS Capital and labor should be friends
BTS Be careful unless you're looking for trouble
BTS His free hand went to my throat and in that moment I knew the bitterest foretaste of death earned by one's own idiocy
BTS W
BTS They scattered far and wide over the country and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses
BTS That slight awkwardness
BTS His brows were bright with the divine that was in him and brighter yet shone his eyes from the midst of the radiance that seemed to envelop him as a mantle
BTS Oofty-Oofty who helped me drank
BTS Through it all behind it all was man governing and controlling expressing himself as of old by his mastery over matter
BTS But the beast in the mate was up and rampant and Wolf Larsen was compelled to brush him away with a back-handed sweep of the arm gentle enough apparently but which hurled Johansen back like a cork driving his head against the wall with a crash
BTS And such condemnation
BTS You cannot make the tide of evolution flow backward
BTS But I had not even a moment's indecision
BTS With an artificial foot and they make excellent ones you will be stumping ships' galleys to the end of time I assured him jovially
BTS As he told me the Ghost is an eighty-ton schooner of a remarkably fine model
BTS He tugged harder
BTS CHAPTER XVI I cannot say that the position of mate carried with it anything more joyful than that there were no more dishes to wash
BTS The clay of him had been so moulded in the making
BTS They hauled cabin logs and firewood freighted up to the mines and did all manner of work that horses did in the Santa Clara Valley
BTS What are you going to do
BTS One day a number of men gathered about the pen
BTS In this battle the middle class has no place
BTS In fact his conduct approached that of a bully and he was given to swaggering up and down before Spitz's very nose
BTS But the path began nowhere and ended nowhere and it remained mystery as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery
BTS The substance of the wall seemed as permeable and yielding as light
BTS If you want to keep out of trouble you'll steer clear of him that's my talk
BTS The worst of the storm must have blown that night though little I noticed it
BTS As I writhed about I could see in his eyes that curiosity I had so often noted that wonder and perplexity that questing that everlasting query of his as to what it was all about
BTS One side or the other of his nature was perfectly comprehensible
BTS I'll have to take 'm ashore with me
BTS Them hunters is the wicked boys he broke forth again for he suffered from a constitutional plethora of speech
BTS The light drew them as if they were plants
BTS I am sincere with my soul at least and that is what you are not
BTS He will learn if he has a chance
BTS Her face was white and set
BTS Let us throw off all disguise and accept the truth as Mr
BTS for they alone knew how to reap the whirlwind and make a profit out of it
BTS I shouted at the top of my lungs
BTS In truth he was in better condition than when he had entered prison
BTS But he did not have it in him to be angry with the love-master and when that god elected to laugh at him in a good-natured bantering way he was nonplussed
BTS Yes they're quarrelling over the division of the earnings of the street railways
BTS When you reach out your vaunted strong hands for our palaces and purpled ease we will show you what strength is
BTS A tingle of excitement ran along the air
BTS As he piled wood on the fire he discovered an appreciation of his own body which he had never felt before
BTS Germany Italy France and all Australasia were labor countries--socialist states
BTS How's it bear
BTS But they could hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river timber
BTS How could he spring away with his four legs in the air above him
BTS He could die dumb-mad and fighting to the last but he could not live and be beaten
BTS Leach was the last to go falling sheer back from the top of the scuttle and striking on head and shoulders upon his sprawling mates beneath
BTS It was unusually cruel-looking and at first I had shuddered every time I used it
BTS His hunting had been good and for a week he had eaten his fill
BTS He had met a townsman a couple of years before in some sailor boarding-house in Chile so that he knew his mother to be still alive
BTS and that freight cars have been burned by employers' agents during railroad strikes in order to increase disorder
BTS As he arose he lowered his crossed arms exposing the bestial face of Beauty Smith
BTS Hello
BTS Sometimes in the traces when jerked by a sudden stoppage of the sled or by straining to start it he would cry out with pain
BTS From below came the fatal roaring where the wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the rocks which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb
BTS Not wholly he replied
BTS Pressing the pillow against his left ear I asked him if he heard me but he gave no sign
BTS They knew while Ernest was speaking that some violent act was to be committed
BTS White Fang received the nursing
BTS I sprang excitedly to my feet
BTS and the other two were Mason and Vanderbold the brains of the inner circle of the Oligarchy's secret service
BTS But he was going too fast and the hound was too close
BTS But I took no notice
BTS For two weeks we toiled at building a hut
BTS What is the end
BTS The capitalists have stolen our country debauched our politics defiled our judiciary and ridden over us rough-shod and now they propose to murder those who will not abjectly surrender to their brutal dominion
BTS White Fang had never seen such a dog it was a mastiff
BTS I had heard of jerking beef on the plains and our seal-meat cut in thin strips and hung in the smoke cured excellently
BTS for I have been with him during these twenty anxious years and I know his patience his untiring effort his infinite devotion to the Cause for which only two months gone he laid down his life
BTS and from them he came to know that the things not alive were not all in the same state of stable equilibrium as was his cave also that small things not alive were more liable than large things to fall down or turn over
BTS They twisted his words and phrases away from the context and turned his subdued and controlled remarks into a howling anarchistic speech
BTS Her lips moved and though they formed no words she commanded me with her eyes plainly as speech to go to the help of the unfortunate man
BTS It was against the law and he had learned it
BTS You are a god and God cannot be killed
BTS And not alone shelter for you have given your love yourself
BTS And he drew the parallel and included me guilty of a similar act
BTS I went on deck
BTS Under the Bishop's guidance I learned something of my own neighborhood
BTS But the god made no hostile movement and went on calmly talking
BTS But to the cub the spectacle of her protective rage was pleasing
BTS Smallpox in 'Onolulu two broken legs in Shanghai pnuemonia in Unalaska three busted ribs an' my insides all twisted in 'Frisco
BTS And through it all the Black Hundreds played their part
BTS And White Fang was growling responsively the crooning note of the growl more pronounced than ever
BTS But this was no more than temporary
BTS The coffin at the side of the fire served for seat and table
BTS I am afraid the Church was dumb the Bishop confessed
BTS You're right he acknowledged at once
BTS If you open your mouth when you get back to Dawson I'll have you run out of town
BTS I went back to my horse blankets and waited an hour for Garthwaite
BTS It is the law
BTS he asked apathetically
BTS I've talked to him like a brother but it's little he sees in takin' in his lights or flyin' false signals
BTS Millions of people were starving while the oligarchs and their supporters were surfeiting on the surplus
BTS Then his weakness asserted itself and he lay down his ears cocked his head on one side as he watched the puppy
BTS I do not like the picture
BTS It's a mint
BTS You reminded me for all the world of the scholastics of the Middle Ages who gravely and learnedly debated the absorbing question of how many angels could dance on the point of a needle
BTS And then you shall lie down and sleep
BTS and finally the screaming bedlam of women
BTS That nothing moved nor sounded seemed ominous
BTS I could see the vain beat and flutter of her as she strove pressing her face against his breast to escape from him
BTS I said brutally for I was not quite pleased with her thanking me
BTS I don't know anything more
BTS Leach and Johnson were the two particular victims of Wolf Larsen's diabolic temper and the look of profound melancholy which had settled on Johnson's face and in his eyes made my heart bleed
BTS Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity
BTS Hearst made a gallant fight
BTS They jes' know we ain't loaded to kill Henry remarked at bed-time indicating the gleaming circle that hemmed them in
BTS They had lost no dogs during the night and they swung out upon the trail and into the silence the darkness and the cold with spirits that were fairly light
BTS We will rise in our strength
BTS So he worked hard learned discipline and was obedient
BTS How could he have been an eagle and not have pride
BTS It's a circle
BTS But and there it is we want to live and move though we have no reason to because it happens that it is the nature of life to live and move to want to live and move
BTS And the California Mercenaries were in reality the most faithful of all to their salt
BTS He worked along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining and in this angle he came to bay protected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the front
BTS that is impressed with certain human fictions such as righteousness and honesty and that will live up to them in spite of all personal discomforts and menaces
BTS Early in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted accident
BTS The Iron Heel will use all its power to prevent it but it will fail
BTS I supported myself in the companion-way weak and trembling while the observation was being verified by the remarks of the rest of the men
BTS The men tried to row with the splinters and had them shot out of their hands
BTS The stockholders furnish the capital
BTS A man's got his rights
BTS Did you lack ambition
BTS Did they walk by the beach of a sea where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered it was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance
BTS The trunk of the body moved slightly
BTS Too bad we sighted them I said as the Ghost's bow was flung off a point by a large sea and the boat leaped for a moment past the jibs and into our line of vision
BTS Kelly subsided with some muttering and the Kanaka flashed his white teeth in a grateful smile
BTS Nothing was to be seen of his chest however for it was covered with a mass of black hair in appearance like the furry coat of a dog
BTS But this is   He paused awhile for the word murder was his final judgment
BTS I looked proudly at my work
BTS She compelled obedience from him and the older he grew the shorter grew her temper
BTS The entire six thousand were annihilated
BTS I don't think it was worth it I said to Wolf Larsen a broken boat for Kelly's life
BTS We are not prepared to brave the sea
BTS They were a new kind of men to Buck of which he was destined to see many more and while he developed no affection for them he none the less grew honestly to respect them
BTS The puppy's name as White Fang was afterward to hear him called was Lip-lip
BTS I talk of the instinct of life which is to live and which when death looms near and large masters the instinct so called of immortality
BTS The death which Wolf Larsen and even Thomas Mugridge had made me fear I no longer feared
BTS And the gods were kind
BTS I became suspicious
BTS Each rolling mountain whelmed them from view and I would wait with sickening anxiety fearing that they would never appear again
BTS When Thornton passed a caressing hand along his back a snapping and crackling followed the hand each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact
BTS 'E cawn't live as long as me
BTS It was no reasoned impulse that made White Fang do what he then did
BTS In his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls and they had retaliated by teasing him
BTS Perhaps it was to this that the golden colour was due
BTS and because of their faith for three centuries they were able to hold back the mighty tide of human progress--a spectacle profound tremendous puzzling to the metaphysical moralist and one that to the materialist is the cause of many doubts and reconsiderations
BTS He paused but nobody spoke up
BTS He did not formulate the law in clear set terms and moralise about it
BTS But my next sharp recollection begins with the crack of a rifle and an abrupt becoming aware that I am being fired at by a soldier in an automobile
BTS It has taken steps to prevent another general strike
BTS My reason dictates it
BTS I have dreamed as greatly as the Corsican
BTS This we knew for we still maintained our night-watches
BTS but now that it was off he would show them
BTS ' Eh Hump
BTS Wickson who sat behind me was unaffected for I heard him sneer aloud Utopian
BTS They were fighters that was certain
BTS They are superficial casuists
BTS What you and the mate there are going to do to me sir
BTS The smoke was still miles astern but overhauling us rapidly when we lowered our boats
BTS I must say that I was fascinated by the perfect lines of Wolf Larsen's figure and by what I may term the terrible beauty of it
BTS Now you red-eyed devil he said when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of Buck's body
BTS Ernest's jaw snapped like a trap
BTS Day was a twilight and night was a black silence
BTS He did not move
BTS There was something so imperative and masterful about him that I was quite beside myself rattled as Furuseth would have termed it like a quaking child before a stern school-master
BTS It was cold and he gasped breathing quickly
BTS But how was Chicago shut off from the rest of the world to know
BTS Great
BTS But the time went by and the dinner went by and he never opened his mouth to speak while the ministers talked interminably about the working class and its relation to the church and what the church had done and was doing for it
BTS 'Oo ever did anything for me heh
BTS But it won't continue she said with easy confidence
BTS He swam powerfully and was dragged ashore by Pete and Hans at the very point where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began
BTS His instinct would not permit him to attack her while her persistence would not permit him to ignore her
BTS I did not attempt to shout but communicated the news to Wolf Larsen by waving my arm
BTS Deep in the forest a call was sounding and as often as he heard this call mysteriously thrilling and luring he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire and the beaten earth around it and to plunge into the forest and on and on he knew not where or why
BTS it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their mighty hearts
BTS If they will only hold their hands until the season is over he promises them a royal carnival when all grudges can he settled and the survivors may toss the non-survivors overboard and arrange a story as to how the missing men were lost at sea
BTS Grey Beaver had crossed the great watershed between Mackenzie and the Yukon in the late winter and spent the spring in hunting among the western outlying spurs of the Rockies
BTS but I saw her eyes return to his involuntarily as though fascinated
BTS He was a fierce little cub
BTS I was beneath the water suffocating and drowning
BTS but there was no friendliness of intercourse displayed on either side no gladness at meeting no desire to return to the pack-formation
BTS CHAPTER XII The last twenty-four hours have witnessed a carnival of brutality
BTS Am I right
BTS All went well with Donnelly until in the following year he found among the sheaf of executions that fell to him the name of Timothy Donnelly
BTS Suspicion by the nature of the situation was turned aside
BTS Your conventional morality is stronger than you
BTS Then naught came up out of the blackness save a heavy panting of some creature struggling sorely for air
BTS The audience had been growing more and more restless and unsettled and the faces of those that sat on the platform had been betraying greater and greater dismay and consternation
BTS He watched the man-animals coming and going and moving about the camp
BTS The practice and the name continued in the twentieth century
BTS There had been his terrific headaches and we were agreed that it was some sort of brain break-down and that in his attacks he endured pain beyond our comprehension
BTS God
BTS The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test
BTS They've ate the leather offen both ends
BTS Its limits were the walls of the lair
BTS His early training when he fought with Lip-lip and the whole puppy-pack stood him in good stead
BTS for old fat Louis'll live the voyage out if the last mother's son of yez go to the fishes
BTS Grey Beaver was his own particular god and in spite of Grey Beaver's will White Fang still clung to him and would not give him up
BTS The damp straw of the mattress fired from beneath and denied air had been smouldering all the while
BTS She was positively bewitching and withal sweetly spirituelle if not saintly
BTS But Beauty Smith had a purpose in all that he did to White Fang
BTS Everybody save Beauty Smith looked apprehensively the fear of the police strong upon them
BTS He studied it intently for a moment then took a careful grip with his teeth and started off down the stream partly carrying partly dragging the porcupine with head turned to the side so as to avoid stepping on the prickly mass
BTS And you are responsible for all this young man he said directly to Ernest
BTS and love
BTS The pack had been loath to forego the kill it had hunted down and it lingered for several minutes making sure of the sounds and then it too sprang away on the trail made by the she-wolf
BTS As I lay with my eyes closed I heard the same dull sound of distant explosions
BTS All this I saw on the very instant of seeing and as I sprang forward
BTS We must do as Christ did
BTS An argument which the future is preparing in answer to the demands of American Socialism
BTS They did not know what had become of him
BTS Faithfulness and willingness characterised his toil
BTS He had looked upon life in a more ferocious aspect
BTS White man's dogs would have no show against him Scott went on
BTS She gathered many of the stones which I built into the walls of the hut
BTS We are consumed in our own flesh-pots
BTS But the man shifting the club from right to left coolly caught him by the under jaw at the same time wrenching downward and backward
BTS Here's your money
BTS Besides organized labor had been so badly beaten that it did not care
BTS Later on when he had travelled more and grown older and wiser and come to know more of trails and rivers it might be that he could grasp and apprehend such a possibility
BTS This he had never experienced at Judge Miller's down in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley
BTS They knew not what end would come but they never anticipated a more disastrous end than the one that did come
BTS We fell into discussion philosophy science evolution religion
BTS He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge's sons
BTS Every man to his trade
BTS But by our law believe me it is quite lawful
BTS She was woman my kind on my plane and the delightful intimacy of kind of man and woman was possible as well as the reverence and awe in which I knew I should always hold her
BTS 'I mean something substantial
BTS He was very much afraid
BTS There were more men and many women and children forty souls of them and all heavily burdened with camp equipage and outfit
BTS I shook my head
BTS Matt did that it was his business
BTS Frog was the strongest dog of the bunch Bill pronounced finally
BTS the fellows at the University Club and the Bibelot shaking their heads and saying Poor chap
BTS I had no doubt but that I should come through somehow
BTS At the Five Fingers the dog-food gave out and a toothless old squaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the Colt's revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at Hal's hip
BTS There is no discussion of this I am sure
BTS I looked at her
BTS he demanded
BTS This gave them the seeming of ghostly masques undertakers in a spectral world at the funeral of some ghost
BTS He could resist the call of the world no longer
BTS The taste of the salt was strong in my mouth and I was strangling with the acrid stuff in my throat and lungs
BTS And you too seem a part of it
BTS And that was the last of Francois and Perrault
BTS Wolf Larsen looked curiously at him as though about to probe and vivisect him then changed his mind as from the foregone conclusion that there was nothing there to probe
BTS The last line was down
BTS Say Henry he asked suddenly how many dogs did you say we had
BTS he cried coming back with a heavy club in his hand
BTS When he watched the hairy man sleeping by the fire head between his knees and hands clasped above Buck saw that he slept restlessly with many starts and awakenings at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness and fling more wood upon the fire
BTS White Fang's suspicious eyes followed every movement
BTS As it was he cowered down in a paralysis of fear already half proffering the submission that his kind had proffered from the first time a wolf came in to sit by man's fire and be made warm
BTS Unlike most leaders who when camp was made and the dogs were unhitched huddled near to the gods for protection White Fang disdained such protection
BTS But Matt's hand went limp in the other's grasp as his gaze shot past and remained fixed on something behind him
BTS He's trying to speak I do believe Beth announced
BTS I could see that he knew what had made me possibly as sick as Harrison that he was trying to draw me and I answered It was because of the brutal treatment of that boy
BTS With his one eye the elder saw the opportunity
BTS Here stood the old Hudson's Bay Company fort
BTS He took Garthwaite's name and number then turned to me
BTS White Fang's teeth drove into the scrawny throat
BTS In the midst of it the Kanaka roused
BTS It is true that we want to destroy the trusts in order that our profits may remain to us
BTS Most of us went bankrupt
BTS And I saw that Ernest noted it and was amused
BTS but from my lofty perch I looked down as though outside the Ghost and apart from her and saw the shape of her outlined sharply against the foaming sea as she tore along instinct with life
BTS The sails did require some cutting and the canvas heavy with water tried my strength severely
BTS Oars were shipped and its occupants waited for us to heave to and take them aboard
BTS There was no more shooting though the rifles were still cracking merrily from the other boats
BTS She shook her head
BTS Besides my work in the cabin with its four small state-rooms I was supposed to be his assistant in the galley and my colossal ignorance concerning such things as peeling potatoes or washing greasy pots was a source of unending and sarcastic wonder to him
BTS He was too old too firmly moulded to become adept at expressing himself in new ways
BTS Let go that foreboom tackle and pass it across and when she's willing let go the sheet and come in snug with the tackle
BTS Sometimes they came upon him and men faced him like heroes or stampeded through barbed-wire fences to the delight of the commonwealth reading the account at the breakfast table
BTS Then he was a masterful dog and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery
BTS It was quite a famous train
BTS Better turn in now and get some sleep
BTS It was to be expected
BTS We were just stepping out upon the sidewalk
BTS If for no other reason it was no time when one was protecting and trying to save a woman to ask that woman for her love
BTS We may expect to meet Death Larsen on the Japan coast
BTS Weedon Scott strode half across the room toward him at the same time calling him
BTS The possession of a god implies service
BTS What if I should cry out
BTS She insisted and said Please please whereupon I turned the oar over to her and obeyed
BTS When he could no longer endure he would get up and stalk determinedly away from them
BTS Thomas Mugridge popped out of his galley like a jack-in-the-box
BTS As they circled about snarling ears laid back keenly watchful for the advantage the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity
BTS He wanted not to escape a clubbing but to have the leadership
BTS Wickson broke in to demand
BTS He slid his head around a corner of rock where began an unusually large bend in the stream and his quick eyes made out something that sent him crouching swiftly down
BTS Her quickness matched his
BTS I waved my arm from the forecastle head and dropped down to the deck
BTS The dogs had quarrels among themselves but these were forgotten when trouble was brewing with White Fang
BTS There were two kinds of life his own kind and the other kind
BTS It was always in the way he was averring while Hartman was talking back to him and with fitting secret-service pride explaining to him the clumsiness of the police
BTS Ernest said suddenly to Mr
BTS These strong oligarchs arose out of the conflict of competition and travelled the inevitable road toward combination
BTS Of course the militia law did not work smoothly at first
BTS Wickson and Mrs
BTS I selected mainly from the canned goods and by the time I was ready willing hands were extended from above to receive what I passed up
BTS I had never rowed in my life but I put out the oars and at the expense of much effort got the boat clear of the Ghost
BTS These old bones of mine are fragile and I've learned my lesson
BTS As he pulled and tugged and wrenched he kept exclaiming with every expulsion of breath Beasts
BTS My train was four hours late
BTS When his mother was absent he slept most of the time while during the intervals that he was awake he kept very quiet suppressing the whimpering cries that tickled in his throat and strove for noise
BTS Yes thank you for the word all my brutishness but he can scarcely read or write
BTS the cook cried
BTS The next moment Weedon Scott had torn loose from the embrace and closed with White Fang who had become a snarling raging demon
BTS Her wit was playing keenly and she was enjoying the tilt as much as Wolf Larsen and he was enjoying it hugely
BTS Giving over his attempt to determine the shadow he stepped on deck and started forward walking with a swiftness and confidence which surprised me
BTS But those are actual things
BTS One hundred and eighty-five dollars sir I answered
BTS I never was so apparelled in my life
BTS That's because you're not a fool I suppose said Hal
BTS Three were short-haired pointers one was a Newfoundland and the other two were mongrels of indeterminate breed
BTS And the result was willy-nilly that he was led away to a private sanitarium for mental disease while in the newspapers appeared pathetic accounts of his mental breakdown and of the saintliness of his character
BTS The blow was like a flash of light
BTS I should certainly have done so out in that world to which we belonged
BTS In the near distance in contrast with the young-green of the tended grass sunburnt hay-fields showed tan and gold
BTS His is the courage of fear a strange thing I know well of myself and at any moment it may master the fear and impel him to the taking of my life
BTS The sled was broken out
BTS Without volition I leaned toward her as a tree is swayed by the wind
BTS For an hour I steered each moment becoming more difficult
BTS Think of it
BTS I don't know
BTS This time having missed the boat and not being in the same position as in the previous instances Wolf Larsen was compelled to resort to a different manoeuvre
BTS God knows I don't want to spend my last days in an insane asylum
BTS The tackle dragged heavily across the rail increasing its drag as the spar arose more and more out of the water and the exertion on the windlass grew severe
BTS Countless executions took place everywhere
BTS but my action with those women sisters of mine shows me that the better way is easy to find
BTS The hunters possibly no more than tolerated me though none of them disliked me
BTS Once during a brief halt when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start both Dave and Sol-leks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing
BTS Give 'm time
BTS It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life
BTS They wept over the miseries of the past and over the miseries yet to come under the iron rule of Wolf Larsen
BTS I have followed the whole discussion with amazement and disgust
BTS Chapter IV
BTS As the boat ascended on a sea her feet touched and I released her hands
BTS Never saw the inside of one worse luck was the answer
BTS You were saying
BTS It would flutter and live till the last line of communication was broken and after that who was to say how much longer it might continue to flutter and live
BTS I had taken my dried clothes down from the galley the night before and the first thing I did was to exchange the cook's garments for them
BTS Upon the whole then whether we consult the Jewish policy instituted by God himself or the uniform opinion and practice of mankind in all ages or the injunctions of the New Testament and the moral law we are brought to the conclusion that slavery is not immoral
BTS he knew only that he must submit to the will of this new master obey his every whim and fancy
BTS In return he feigned anger bristling and growling ferociously and clipping his teeth together in snaps that had all the seeming of deadly intention
BTS I confess he makes me nervous around the children she said
BTS He was becoming more morose more uncompanionable more solitary more ferocious
BTS Life became for me very happy in the refuge
BTS And yet we had thousands of our agents among them
BTS He was succeeded by his son Lewis Pocock and for five generations this remarkable line of slave-drivers handled the coal mines
BTS To them the elimination of scars and disfigurements was a trivial detail
BTS And there were further reaches of vague and indeterminate feelings that stirred in me
BTS He could not have used a better word
BTS What is the matter
BTS Let us see
BTS And in his own dim way he learned the law of meat
BTS Yet it moved
BTS But endure it he must or perish and the life that was in him had no desire to perish out
BTS And through it all the inevitable caste-weakening will go on so that in the end the common people will come into their own
BTS I know that there is much that is sad and wicked in this world
BTS All the boy knew was that he had in some unaccountable way been overturned into the snow and that his club-hand had been ripped wide open by White Fang's teeth
BTS He caught the one-eyed elder on his blind side and ripped his ear into ribbons
BTS Sometimes however a nip on his hind-quarters hastened his retreat and made it anything but stately
BTS The fact that he had but one eye and that the left eye might account for this
BTS for this was the mail train carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow of the Pole
BTS His instinct had been true
BTS The grip had been joined by two large canvas bags and a box
BTS Ordinarily grey and cold and harsh they were now warm and soft and golden and all a-dance with tiny lights that dimmed and faded or welled up till the full orbs were flooded with a glowing radiance
BTS In the morning Henry renewed the fire and cooked breakfast to the accompaniment of his partner's snoring
BTS He nodded his head
BTS I'm jes' plump tuckered out
BTS The three maids who accompanied me were revolutionists
BTS He sprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them both and Spitz particularly for his whole experience with Buck had gone to teach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog who managed to hold his own only because of his great weight and size
BTS The she-wolf too left her litter and went out in search of meat
BTS We'll make it I think
BTS Logic and physics were no part of his mental make-up
BTS It was the unknown objectified at last in concrete flesh and blood bending over him and reaching down to seize hold of him
BTS beneath the flesh the spirit had still raged splendid and invincible
BTS His hands shook his whole body quivered and shrank away from the picture he had conjured
BTS They only laughed and poked sticks at him which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that that was what they wanted
BTS Again the bakers of that time were terribly overworked
BTS It was a sleep-walker Maud guided and supported
BTS As we ran off to get our leeward position of the last lee boat we found the ocean fairly carpeted with sleeping seals
BTS Johnson was telling me about her in a short chat I had with him during yesterday's second dog-watch
BTS I was confident that we should find a station in some one of the coves for I knew that the rookeries of Bering Sea were thus guarded
BTS Dawn caught us on the northern brow and in the gray light we dropped down through chaparral into redwood canyons deep and warm with the breath of passing summer
BTS Kerfoot thus directly addressed was startled into dropping his knife on the floor though he managed to grunt affirmation
BTS A companion organization to the Valkyries was the Berserkers
BTS He was no fool himself and whatever vengeance he desired to wreak he could wait until he caught White Fang alone
BTS And then I had ceased seeking
BTS All that they saw of him was his bushy tail and fleeing hind legs a view far less ferocious and intimidating than his bristling mane and gleaming fangs
BTS The soldiers were dragging the bodies away from the wheels when it happened
BTS I saw the glad light spring into her eyes and knew that I had lost
BTS A moment later he was inside the house and the slaughter began
BTS His lips were on mine before I could protest or resist
BTS Then the match went out
BTS But she shook her head as one might shake off sleep or a dream saying I have known it all my life
BTS I shall always think of it with pride I said to Maud
BTS Yes the geese
BTS You're a preacher aren't you
BTS This occurred in 2073 A
BTS The wind was now dead astern muttering and puffing stronger and stronger and my head-sails were pounding lustily
BTS We got back to find Ernest alarmed by my absence
BTS A few minutes later Henry who was now travelling behind the sled emitted a low warning whistle
BTS He scrutinized me keenly and was half convinced then shook his head and would not believe
BTS Again the tiny point of black projected itself through the wrathful blaze a couple of points off our port-bow
BTS A third time the attempt was made but this time following the advice Hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow
BTS And Perrault nodded
BTS White Fang came upon him unexpectedly
BTS White Fang himself began to grow aware of it though in his consciousness he knew not what love was
BTS I looked at Maud Brewster and knew that she was similarly affected
BTS There was grave talk about the bacillus of violence that infected all men who embraced socialism
BTS He went on whetting his knife
BTS In the first place he was very suspicious of them
BTS And when outside I stopped short
BTS He might roll a dog off its feet but the pack would be upon him before he could follow up and deliver the deadly throat-stroke
BTS That is why you cannot compete with them
BTS At eight o'clock I had succeeded only in putting the second reef into the foresail
BTS In all his life he's only been known once to go off his feet and here he's been rolled twice in thirty seconds
BTS The captain broke loose upon the dead man like a thunderclap
BTS She defied all efforts of the master to make her become friends with White Fang
BTS He forgot that in the covenant entered into between him and the gods they were pledged to care for him and defend him
BTS How many dogs 've we got Henry
BTS PATENT MEDICINES were patent lies but like the charms and indulgences of the Middle Ages they deceived the people
BTS Bill waved his hand at it threateningly and shouted loudly
BTS Look at 'm
BTS When he started up the companion-way I retreated silently rolling over on top of the cabin
BTS White Fang trembled waiting for the punishment to fall upon him
BTS I knew what you had come for
BTS I didn't sign for boat-puller sir was the reply
BTS I have been robbed sir I amended
BTS There is yet a chance to stop it I said if nothing happens to the train and I can get there in time
BTS A few of the boldest and wisest forsook the fires of the gods which had now become a shambles and fled into the forest where in the end they starved to death or were eaten by wolves
BTS Just turned sixteen sir A lie
BTS Everhard here clearly develops the cause of all the labor troubles of that time
BTS because I cannot fight and overcome him just as you will not be able to fight and overcome him
BTS The other portion killed and ate his own kind or was killed and eaten by his own kind
BTS They lowered sails shot seals and hoisted sails again and continued on their way as I had always seen them do
BTS Tired as I was exhausted in fact I was prevented from sleeping by the pain in my knee
BTS This belief persists throughout the literature of the three centuries of the Iron Heel and even in the literature of the first century of the Brotherhood of Man
BTS And in passing I will ask you managers of society why you did not make public the census figures of 1910
BTS and in 1910 1688211
BTS My first mate's berth on the sealing grounds stood me in good stead and I cleared the inner cove and laid a long tack along the shore of the outer cove
BTS He knew the breed and he gave his advice in the certainty that it would not be followed
BTS She was clearly on the verge of physical collapse
BTS While as for getting him off his feet there was no dog among them capable of doing the trick
BTS She was not frightened but appalled rather at the human animality of it
BTS Which is a very poor way of saying that it is good for oneself to be strong and evil for oneself to be weak or better yet it is pleasurable to be strong because of the profits
BTS SOCIETY was the creation of the idle rich who toiled not and who in this way played
BTS Don't you see your position gentlemen
BTS Yours is to do your own work and to have Cooky stand by the fore-sheet
BTS Grey Beaver made mouth-noises which White Fang interpreted as not hostile so he came still nearer
BTS A return of apprehension was apparent when at the top of the companion-way Wolf Larsen invited him below
BTS Those cursed hunters was his comment
BTS Twice we have passed a national income tax and each time the supreme court smashed it as unconstitutional
BTS There was nothing lively about it no snap or go in him and his fellows
BTS He was especially delighted because his discharge had been precipitated by the publication of his book Economics and Education
BTS I said I wouldn't if ary dog turned up missin' an' I won't
BTS He had received another stroke
BTS They will charge him four dollars and twenty cents a year on a thousand-dollar accident policy and for the same policy they will charge a laborer fifteen dollars
BTS But instead of a sweeping victory with chief executive officers and majorities in all legislative bodies we found ourselves in the minority
BTS He crawled frantically clear of the water and lay down
BTS He was evidently for all of his youth and inexperience cock of the forecastle
BTS Let's go back
BTS He was too self-possessed too strongly poised in his own isolation
BTS In less than five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles during the last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days' rest
BTS This first day was made more difficult for me from the fact that the Ghost under close reefs terms such as these I did not learn till later was plunging through what Mr
BTS We shall go clear I said with a confidence which I knew deceived neither of us
BTS He was better fitted for the life than the other dogs for he had the training of his cubhood to guide him
BTS Ernest queried mockingly
BTS I started to rush below to the flag-locker then remembered that in rigging the Ghost
BTS It never gave the satisfaction the old windlass had given but it worked and made my work possible
BTS He was curious to observe them fearful of being noticed by them
BTS You counted wrong
BTS Now and again I fitfully slept but the pain of the cold always aroused me
BTS Calvin asked incredulously
BTS It is unselfish as opposed to an act performed for self which is selfish
BTS Beauty Smith replied with a grunt
BTS They were all on their feet now and White Fang ran down the steps looking back for them to follow
BTS But the next moment two of Ernest's statements came flashing into my consciousness The company employs very efficient lawyers and Colonel Ingram is a shrewd lawyer
BTS while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape detection
BTS Then what should I do
BTS Never had Buck seen such dogs
BTS It was her custom to be helpless
BTS His face was drawn and strained and the sweat rolled down his nose from his forehead
BTS In the silence that followed the low half-sobbing whine was heard at the door and then the long questing sniff
BTS It was all bone and muscle
BTS I wanted to kiss it to ripple it through my fingers to bury my face in it
BTS But it could not last
BTS Besides he did not like the hands of the man-animals
BTS You see I am full of what is impending
BTS This accomplished the outfit though cut in half was still a formidable bulk
BTS Labor cannot consume any of it for labor has already spent all its wages
BTS They dominate in several of the systems that extend to the Pacific
BTS I was among the missing dead of the Martinez disaster an unrecovered body
BTS Nor was he slow in advertising the fact
BTS What immortal end did you serve
BTS He was knocked about like a shuttlecock until finally like Johnson he was beaten and kicked as he lay helpless on the deck
BTS Armies of troops were put into the field and the fanatics were herded back at the bayonet point to their tasks in the cities
BTS It was no easy task waiting on the cabin table where sat Wolf Larsen Johansen and the six hunters
BTS Not only was such an act sacrilegious in its nature but it was fraught with peril
BTS I tried to word my refusal but wavered
BTS but where was I to get a fulcrum
BTS At such times he betrayed no anger
BTS My headache was gone but body and soul I was very tired
BTS I shall never forget this conversation
BTS They alone moved through the vast inertness
BTS Now take a run up with the glasses and raise some of the boats
BTS Likewise it was this pride that made him fear Buck as a possible lead-dog
BTS Is that what they pay
BTS The gods were all-wise and there was no telling what masterful treachery lurked behind that apparently harmless piece of meat
BTS She turned him over a prisoner to the 'Frisco Reds
BTS Slave-levies for the rebuilding of Chicago Ernest said
BTS Sure the man replied driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry
BTS But gods are accustomed to being obeyed and Grey Beaver wrathfully launched a canoe in pursuit
BTS but he had become more patient than ever and more solicitous
BTS It was an expression of the master's disapproval and White Fang's spirit wilted under it
BTS How can I prove it
BTS He was splendidly muscled a heavy man and though he strode with the certitude and directness of the physical man there was nothing heavy about his stride
BTS 'Tis a fine chap that squarehead Johnson we've for'ard with us he said
BTS Somebody has put pressure on President Wilcox
BTS But it occurred a century and a half ago
BTS Better get your rifles you fellows Wolf Larsen called to our hunters
BTS I was bloomin' well sure you was a gentleman as soon as I set eyes on yer
BTS This man talking soberly and earnestly about the beauties of idealism and the goodness of God had just betrayed his comrades in a business deal
BTS If it is a good soul it will desire and do the good action and the contrary if it is a bad soul
BTS In fact I was vivisecting him and turning over his soul-stuff as keenly and thoroughly as it was his custom to do it to others
BTS Each moment I looked and everybody looked for him to leap upon the boy and destroy him
BTS The domesticated generations fell from him
BTS He rained upon it curses from God and High Heaven and withered it with a heat of invective that savoured of a mediaeval excommunication of the Catholic Church
BTS The boy is willing enough
BTS Good-night Maud I said
BTS And as he had seen horses work so he was set to work hauling Francois on a sled to the forest that fringed the valley and returning with a load of firewood
BTS The cat-like springiness in his tread was a little more pronounced than usual and his eyes were bright and snappy
BTS but with the boundless faith of youth he persisted in repeating the manoeuvre every little while though it never succeeded in gaining anything for him but discomfiture
BTS The impact of the blow drove her backward but she struck the wall of her on-coming fellows and bounced forward again dazed and helpless the brandished hatchet falling feebly on Hartman's shoulder
BTS But when one morning the air was rent with the report of a rifle close at hand and a bullet smashed against a tree trunk several inches from One Eye's head they hesitated no more but went off on a long swinging lope that put quick miles between them and the danger
BTS An idealistic monist who long puzzled the philosophers of that time with his denial of the existence of matter but whose clever argument was finally demolished when the new empiric facts of science were philosophically generalized
BTS Well have I convinced you
BTS There were seven all together including him
BTS I wanted to know why things were and how they came to pass
BTS I'll tell you what you do Miss Cunningham
BTS He was all but naked a ragged and fire-scorched skin hanging part way down his back but on his body there was much hair
BTS They came up to where I was standing by the entrance to the companion-way
BTS Heard him offering it
BTS Kowalt pondered and shook his head
BTS A dozen times Perrault nosing the way broke through the ice bridges being saved by the long pole he carried which he so held that it fell each time across the hole made by his body
BTS But this is too far in advance of events
BTS Lobby--a peculiar institution for bribing bulldozing and corrupting the legislators who were supposed to represent the people's interests
BTS Had the porcupine been entirely unrolled or had it not discovered its enemy a fraction of a second before the blow was struck the paw would have escaped unscathed
BTS So when his blue moods come on nothing remains for him but to be devilish
BTS That was the measure of his manhood
BTS His furry coat shone with the sheen of silk
BTS The second dog-watch and the day were wound up by a fight between Johansen and the lean Yankee-looking hunter Latimer
BTS And now that we had Wolf Larsen in irons how little did we need it
BTS They were permitted to carry weapons and the authorities aided them in every way
BTS Their movements perceptibly quickened under his coaching and as the boat swung inboard I was sent forward to let go the jibs
BTS One day was very like another
BTS I agree with you
BTS It is a good word  I began
BTS No dog could make him lose his footing
BTS At first he was sceptical
BTS I had slept seven hours
BTS I could have sworn his face fell at the intelligence but why he should be disappointed I could not conceive
BTS His eyes were likewise greeted by White Fang but about the latter there were no signs of shame nor guilt
BTS Beyond is the cemetery--long winding galleries hewn out of the solid rock with recesses on either hand wherein tier above tier lie the revolutionists just as they were laid away by their comrades long years agone
BTS At first he did not know where he was
BTS He had done no wrong broken no law yet here was this boy preparing to give him a beating
BTS The foresail and fore-topsail emptied of the wind by the manoeuvre and with no one to bring in the sheet in time were thundering into ribbons the heavy boom threshing and splintering from rail to rail
BTS Wolf Larsen at the wheel directed the Ghost after the Macedonia's second weather boat
BTS Not when the government suspends civil law
BTS He was laying up trouble for himself for lack of food and short tempers went together
BTS p'yed 'ansomely to sling my 'ook an' keep slingin' it
BTS Yes pig-ethics Ernest went on remorselessly
BTS This was part of the attitude he chose to adopt toward me
BTS But how can you account for it
BTS What he needs is some show of human kindness he added turning and going into the cabin
BTS When the long winter nights come on and the wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys he may be seen running at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering borealis leaping gigantic above his fellows his great throat a-bellow as he sings a song of the younger world which is the song of the pack
BTS The wind died down in the afternoon and we were prepared to start the following morning
BTS And his comrades called him a calamity howler
BTS He could not tolerate them
BTS Oppression sat heavily upon them
BTS I remember writing a review of a thin little volume  I had begun carelessly when she interrupted me
BTS Dick's overtures bothered him so he snarled Dick away
BTS It knew only itself and the vastness and profundity of the quiet and the dark
BTS But I complained no more and set about making a tent of the sail for Maud
BTS In the summers there is one visitor however to that valley of which the Yeehats do not know
BTS To us in this intelligent age such a device is laughably absurd and primitive
BTS Its members were the wealthiest in the community and the strongest-minded of the wealthy with of course a sprinkling of scholars to give it intellectual tone
BTS This lasted for a week while father chuckled and said the book had touched a sore spot on capitalism
BTS I called upon him in his beautiful home
BTS and wages were being cut right and left
BTS Johnson squared away promptly and ran after us
BTS It was a few miles up a small stream that in the summer time flowed into the Mackenzie but that then was frozen over and frozen down to its rocky bottom a dead stream of solid white from source to mouth
BTS Even as late as 1912 A
BTS As fiction those morning papers of October 27th were masterpieces
BTS It was he who was responsible for the introduction of the Russian passport system among the miners and the denial of their right of removal from one part of the country to another
BTS Or else you do not know the whole story
BTS 'Tis just as you're thinkin' you know him and are makin' a favourable slant along him that he whirls around dead ahead and comes howlin' down upon you and a-rippin' all iv your fine-weather sails to rags
BTS The house in which I live cost a hundred thousand dollars and its furnishings books and works of art cost as much more
BTS Now get that sail down and come alongside
BTS They were gazing at the she-wolf who sat smiling in the snow
BTS White Fang hesitated
BTS Hans and Pete moved along the bank snubbing with a thin Manila rope from tree to tree while Thornton remained in the boat helping its descent by means of a pole and shouting directions to the shore
BTS It was evident that they did not like the outlook of a voyage under such a captain and begun so inauspiciously
BTS His eyes were blinded so that he could not see and the blood running from ears and nose and mouth turned the cabin into a shambles
BTS I bailed like a madman
BTS Black Burton a man evil-tempered and malicious had been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar when Thornton stepped good-naturedly between
BTS They draw their salaries for the policy they maintain
BTS She said this last proudly
BTS I know for myself that I was shocked into admiration of the boy and I saw in him the splendid invincibleness of immortality rising above the flesh and the fears of the flesh as in the prophets of old to condemn unrighteousness
BTS then they fell but not swiftly enough to veil the rush of terror that filled them
BTS I heard them when I drove in last night
BTS For instance Mrs
BTS and the establishment of our underground railways which meant the knitting together of all our myriads of places of refuge and the formation of new refuges where links were missing in the chains we ran over all the land
BTS It had prepared for the outbreak and the killing of so many officers gave it justification for what followed
BTS It must have been the conditions she said
BTS Of course two days' work was required for the accomplishment of this part of my task and it was not till the morning of the third day that I swung the foremast from the deck and proceeded to square its butt to fit the step
BTS I asked
BTS Tough as they make them and twice as nasty
BTS he asked
BTS Strait-jackets starvation and beatings and clubbings were the wrong treatment for Jim Hall
BTS In this connection I cannot forbear relating my first experience with a boarding sea
BTS It had snowed during the night and he was completely buried
BTS Still another figure arises out of the old life--Jackson's lawyer
BTS Calvin
BTS The sails of the vessel I had seen off to the south-west had grown larger and plainer
BTS Father was not a sociologist
BTS He would run till Buck's head was even with his flank when he would whirl around at bay only to dash away again at the first opportunity
BTS They still maintained their labor organization and this gave them strength in the political struggle that was on
BTS They ran through the night
BTS Oh he was sick of the sound of Jackson's name
BTS After two efforts they stood still panting
BTS and at the third the boat-steerer let loose his steering-oar and crumpled up in the bottom of the boat
BTS The chance came in one of his quick doublings and counter-circlings
BTS It was the machine that killed her
BTS This did not serve to recover her and she lay on her back on the hard deck arms stretched out and whole body relaxed
BTS A few gamins however were around in their eyes a suppressed eagerness in anticipation of wonderful and exciting things to happen
BTS also the travel pride had gripped him and he purposed to make the record trip of the year
BTS He became cunning
BTS My rhythm grew shorter and shorter
BTS I was to learn as time went by that there were many cases similar to hers and many worse hidden away in the monstrous depths of the tenements in my neighborhood
BTS He did not know whether Buck could start a thousand pounds
BTS He must have measured six feet eight or nine inches in stature and I subsequently learned his weight 240 pounds
BTS H
BTS Death as a cessation of movement as a passing out and away from the lives of the living he knew and he knew John Thornton was dead
BTS but they were silenced when the newcomer lifted his head from his work for a moment and glared at them
BTS Scott shouted as he sprang outside
BTS But I called her this and other and dearer things in my thoughts only
BTS The employers' associations that had helped the captains of industry to tear and rend labor were now torn and rent by their quondam allies
BTS I always get along with the officers he remarked to me in a confidential tone
BTS And despite the absence of confidence and trust we were compelled to base our every effort on confidence and trust
BTS So he lay down in a comfortable crouching position his nose fully a foot away and out of the line of the tail
BTS But what in thunder are you repairing
BTS It was one o'clock
BTS It was just as I had read descriptions of such scenes in books
BTS They could not leave their masters for their masters composed the Plutocracy
BTS Nothing remained but to stand still and accept the indignity
BTS Van Weyden sir
BTS They died easily in their beds--sickness you see one time and another
BTS Of course in common speech with the sailors and hunters it sometimes fairly bristled with errors which was due to the vernacular itself
BTS Nevertheless the delusion persisted in the wealthy class that an absolutely unbreakable will could be cast
BTS At the same moment as though I had been struck myself I felt a sickening shock in the pit of my stomach
BTS He nodded his head
BTS he queried half petulantly
BTS At half-past three in the afternoon we passed the south-western promontory
BTS and as he spoke I remembered the last dividend that had been paid my father and the pretty gown for me and the books for him that had been bought out of that dividend
BTS The wind had fallen to a whisper the ocean was growing calmer and calmer and this coupled with the presence of the great herd made a perfect hunting day one of the two or three days to be encountered in the whole of a lucky season
BTS I held that life was a ferment a yeasty something which devoured life that it might live and that living was merely successful piggishness
BTS In the English merchant service
BTS It dealt in elaborate detail with one factor in the persistence of the established namely the capitalistic bias of the universities and common schools
BTS The dog-musher still on his knees and stooped over White Fang calculated for a moment
BTS The Plutocracy owns sixty-seven billions of wealth
BTS The children struck in all the schools and such teachers as came went home again from deserted class rooms
BTS Their heads were bloody their organization had apparently been destroyed yet out they came along with their allies in the metal-working trades
BTS The proletariat gets its lesson to-day but it gives one too
BTS His face was stern the lines of it had grown hard and yet in his eyes blue clear blue this day there was a strange brilliancy a bright scintillating light
BTS Hammerfield gasped and managed to answer The best of us may be mistaken young man the best of us
BTS Forty thousand were killed in the street-fighting of Tokio and in the futile assault on the Mikado's palace
BTS Our Inner Circle forbade her but she had ever a will of her own and disdained discipline
BTS He was never in the way never extravagant nor foolish in the expression of his love
BTS He saw me but there was no kinship between us and with him at least no sympathy of understanding
BTS CHAPTER III THE OUTCAST Lip-lip continued so to darken his days that White Fang became wickeder and more ferocious than it was his natural right to be
BTS The cub knew only that the sniff was strange a something unclassified therefore unknown and terrible for the unknown was one of the chief elements that went into the making of fear
BTS He was wondering if I were making fun of him
BTS With a slight manifestation of anger Cherokee took up the pursuit again running on the inside of the circle White Fang was making and striving to fasten his deadly grip on White Fang's throat
BTS Thomas Mugridge so strangely and pertinaciously clinging to life was soon limping about again and performing his double duties of cook and cabin-boy
BTS The man waited in vain for them to go
BTS It was this which had given poise and penetration to her own work and made her of worth to the world
BTS Perrault was a French-Canadian and swarthy
BTS No I did not was the answer and his mouth set bitterly
BTS It will turn around and blow fair
BTS A familiar pair of shoulders in a cotton shirt and a familiar fringe of white hair had caught his eye
BTS He encountered a feathered whirlwind
BTS It was utterly unexpected and it was over and done with between the ticks of two seconds
BTS Clasped in the hollow of her arm as a child might be clasped was a bundle of printed matter
BTS Johansen
BTS That also is a fact
BTS Hammerfield muttered lamely
BTS Do be merciful
BTS Ernest had to repeat his question before Mr
BTS By cunning operations on tongue throat larynx and nasal cavities a man's whole enunciation and manner of speech could be changed
BTS The first night in camp Joe the sour one was punished roundly a thing that Spitz had never succeeded in doing
BTS With all respect to Avis Everhard it must be pointed out that Everhard was but one of many able leaders who planned the Second Revolt
BTS Another whisper of wind and another passed by
BTS After all that had passed suffering intolerable anguish in my finger-ends and with three boats missing to say nothing of the wild capers the Ghost was cutting I should have thought it impossible to sleep
BTS By easy stages we smuggled him along our underground railway to the Carmel refuge
BTS He shook his head slowly pondering
BTS That was all
BTS The younger leader turned his head to lick a wound on his shoulder
BTS Slowly the whole eastern sky filled with clouds that over-towered us like some black sierra of the infernal regions
BTS And Mugridge kicked savagely till the Kanaka hanging on with one hand seized the Cockney's foot with the other
BTS He made no movement whatever simply stood there staring at me
BTS Have some coffee Bill
BTS or do I have to hit you again
BTS She was surprised at seeing me but she nodded a pleasant greeting and went on sewing on the pair of men's trousers in her lap
BTS He fought by instinct but he could fight by head as well
BTS And at the end of three days I had a windlass which worked clumsily
BTS The police and the automobile patrols went by and once half a dozen fire-engines returning evidently from some conflagration
BTS I'll be ding-dong-danged if I do
BTS There was no work for him to do
BTS In the meantime they're willin' to pick up anything eatable that comes handy
BTS He had armed himself with a draw-knife from the tool-locker and with this he prepared to cut across the throat-halyards I had again rigged to the shears
BTS Late next morning Buck led the long team up the street
BTS And they've about all the escaping they want I said
BTS and as the days went by and he did not reappear there was much gossip to the effect that he had committed suicide while temporarily deranged
BTS Did I not know that in his profession personal feelings did not count
BTS It was a feeling nothing more and yet none the less potent
BTS But fear was accompanied by another instinct that of concealment
BTS His voice sounded hoarse and unreal and he had spoken with apparent effort
BTS Yet they never replied in kind never defended themselves against her
BTS Who got the advance money
BTS Louis was at the wheel
BTS Being but partly grown his jaws had not yet become large enough nor strong enough to make his throat-attack deadly
BTS It was long a question of debate whether the burning of the South Side ghetto was accidental or whether it was done by the Mercenaries
BTS There seemed nothing vicious in them
BTS It's all right
BTS I put it down to mental deficiency on my part but since then I have decided that it was for want of preparation
BTS For a lawyer you are the hardest man to keep to a point I ever saw Ernest began his answer to the tirade
BTS And White Fang won out on the one chance in ten thousand denied him by the surgeon
BTS but never as now had he faced the possibility of it the eyes of a dozen men fixed upon him silent and waiting
BTS The wind smote the schooner with a sudden gust and she heeled over till her lee rail was buried the roar in her rigging rising in pitch to a shriek
BTS Where many another animal would have died or had its spirit broken he adjusted himself and lived and at no expense of the spirit
BTS There is the militia
BTS and then began the cold grey of afternoon that would merge three hours later into night
BTS He deserves to die I cried out
BTS But the next moment he was calm
BTS We are very hospitable upon the Ghost
BTS Till now Buck had avoided trouble with his enemy but this was too much
BTS The master came to the door and called White Fang inside
BTS So he learnt to give no warning of his intention
BTS Under way and with nothing for the time being to do I turned my attention to the situation of the boats
BTS On the fourth day lame and sore scarcely able to see so closed were his eyes he was haled from his bunk by the nape of the neck and set to his duty
BTS Glimmerings of weakness in the armor of the Oligarchy were given
BTS Charles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance
BTS The next moment he had released me and we were gazing at the Macedonia's lights
BTS Next I tried the newspapers
BTS He lost his arm in the Sierra Mills and like a broken-down horse you turned him out on the highway to die
BTS It was open at In a Balcony and I noticed here and there passages underlined in pencil
BTS Bill had finished his pipe and was helping his companion to spread the bed of fur and blanket upon the spruce boughs which he had laid over the snow before supper
BTS He came out boldly from the forest and trotted into camp straight to Grey Beaver's tepee
BTS And yet there was in his face a permanent pain the pain of the world that he was now taking to himself
BTS He was confused and blinded by the rush of it and the beat of angry wings
BTS I cried defiantly
BTS Sealing schooner after sealing schooner we sighted and boarded most of which were in search of lost boats and most of which were carrying boats and crews they had picked up and which did not belong to them
BTS But I answered you say 'class struggle
BTS She lifted her lip at him in the old snarl of menace and his memory became clear
BTS All his life he had disliked children
BTS It's attacking my nerve-centres eating them up bit by bit cell by cell from the pain
BTS The gong clanged and knelled
BTS History some day will have an excruciating laugh at their expense
BTS Up that staircase the way led to the love-master and to the love-master's dearest possessions
BTS The whole realm was his
BTS A million and a half of the men of the working class say that they are going to get the rest of the working class to join with them and take the management away from you
BTS Also we used Wickson's cream and butter and Ernest was not above shooting Wickson's quail and rabbits and on occasion his young bucks
BTS And to one and all he said Why have you not answered the charge that your class has mismanaged
BTS Beauty Smith started to walk away
BTS It is true Mr
BTS As Thornton got to his feet Buck seized his mittened hand between his jaws pressing in with his teeth and releasing slowly half-reluctantly
BTS I believe that life is a mess he answered promptly
BTS There she blows
BTS White Fang hanging limply continued to cry
BTS Many efforts were made during this period to organize the perishing farmer class into a political party the aim of which was destroy the trusts and corporations by drastic legislation
BTS Perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent than those he had brought in
BTS Here Dr
BTS I was working in a livery stable in San Francisco then
BTS Instinctively we drew closer together in the bottom of the boat
BTS And seem' it's government money you ain't got no kick coming eh Perrault
BTS I never knew what palaces were good for
BTS An' he was no fool dog neither Henry added
BTS she was not strong
BTS So there cannot be any complaint
BTS And there was a subconscious resentment that these his kind at first sight had pitched upon him and tried to destroy him
BTS Here and there a soldier was discharging his rifle but this scattered fire had no effect in checking the mob
BTS He feared and disliked the beating he knew to be waiting for him
BTS But something lacked
BTS We were the first of his old friends he had met since his disappearance he told us
BTS I pulled in the oars and bent forward to the line which held the tow
BTS though I noticed when we returned to the deck a slight twitching of the nostrils a perceptible quickness of movement
BTS Philosophy unifies the knowledge that is contributed by all the sciences
BTS They sensed between themselves and him a difference of kind cause sufficient in itself for hostility
BTS I had slept late and I stepped outside with sudden energy bent upon making up lost time as befitted a dweller on Endeavour Island
BTS He moved his hand over the array of volumes on the walls of his tiny office
BTS But this time he missed by forty feet the boat passing astern
BTS It was oil and water and there was no hope for him though for a short period he was a source of serious apprehension to the Plutocrats
BTS Beauty Smith blinked in the lamplight and looked about him
BTS He yielded till the hand almost touched him
BTS A mad rush of anger sent him leaping in amongst the combatants
BTS While really very estimable Mr
BTS I discovered that we stood in need of condensed milk and marmalade and announced that I was going aboard
BTS All Sierra Vista was gathered around
BTS I queried
BTS Worse than that he did not seem to be aware of them
BTS Then a few minutes later having digested his instructions and thoroughly mastered the manoeuvre I would proceed to issue my orders
BTS White Fang scarcely knew what happened
BTS Convinced of this I toiled with him at the revolution and did not exhaust my energy in alleviating the social ills that continuously arose from the injustice of the system
BTS We've got to get out of this
BTS And then she would be up on her feet and toiling hard as ever
BTS Even then it was not too late for Baseek to retrieve the situation
BTS Then you will undoubtedly understand the definition I shall now make of philosophy
BTS There is a saying that truth will out
BTS I signed for cabin-boy
BTS And besides it was a lesson
BTS He shrugged his shoulders
BTS he shouted
BTS She responded and I made sure of her
BTS 'Ow can it be myde up to me I arsk
BTS Nothin' came the answer
BTS A cry of startled admiration went up
BTS Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank where Judge Miller's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon
BTS I fixed him was Carlson's unimaginative way of describing the affair
BTS The British Empire was falling apart
BTS Also he learned the value of surprise
BTS True Christ died between two thieves but that is another story
BTS In the cabin he lay on the floor near the stove without interest in food in Matt nor in life
BTS Leach laughed and hurled more of his Telegraph Hill Billingsgate and before either he or I knew what had happened his right arm had been ripped open from elbow to wrist by a quick slash of the knife
BTS Every advance on his part was accompanied by a corresponding retreat on her part
BTS I did not argue
BTS Do you know the only value life has is what life puts upon itself
BTS It was a challenge but Smoke refused to accept it
BTS He slipped down from his sitting posture till he lay on the deck
BTS for having sped his shaft he was turning away

BTS Making this tackle fast I took to the windlass the shears-tackle which was connected with the end of the boom and with a few turns had the mast perpendicular and clear
BTS And who is the captain
BTS What if the First Revolt is lost
BTS He merely surmises that there is some strain of dog in White Fang
BTS Hitherto they had been denied access to the fire and they now settled down in a close-drawn circle like so many dogs blinking and yawning and stretching their lean bodies in the unaccustomed warmth
BTS also a typewriter
BTS It was at the beginning of this movement that Garthwaite and I had encountered the young officer
BTS I was not sniffling though my face might well have been drawn and twitching from the pain
BTS I could hear them crying out to one another
BTS He was fit that was all and unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life
BTS And woe to the dog that at such times ran foul of him
BTS You are spineless flaccid things
BTS The novelty of the situation lay in that their revolt was passive
BTS yet he had to do something
BTS And with the opening of my eyes and the looking came intolerable torment
BTS I do believe his whine was congenital
BTS Many little privileges were taken away from it while its wages and its standard of living steadily sank down
BTS I found nothing but stupidity except for business
BTS An' of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption behind them affirmed a second of the men
BTS I had but to look at her or think of her and be strong again
BTS The half-breed tried to drive him away with the whip
BTS and second when he had incurred the risk by dodging and by retreating
BTS The government issued a proclamation for all law-abiding citizens to come in from the mountains for a period of three months
BTS Evidently the strange steamboat had lowered its boats
BTS Scott cried out sharply with surprise catching his torn hand and holding it tightly in his other hand
BTS They were as dead men in their comrades' eyes and between them was the gulf that parts the living and the dead
BTS I'll show you another way
BTS So next day the hunting began
BTS Not at all
BTS It was not too cold
BTS It was now a variegated wall composed of the trees that fringed the stream the opposing mountain that towered above the trees and the sky that out-towered the mountain
BTS and he came because men had found a yellow metal in the North and because Manuel was a gardener's helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers small copies of himself
BTS That's it isn't it
BTS ' you are crying
BTS Well you needn't get so all-fired het up about it
BTS She dropped on her knees before Buck with tears in her eyes and put her arms around his neck
BTS They're pretty desperate I can tell you
BTS The exhibition they make of their feelings is not a touching sight yet it shows how deeply they have been touched how deeply their purses have been touched for to lay hands on their purses is to lay hands on their souls
BTS It will be the making of you
BTS Van Weyden he said
BTS He has all my my  Brutishness I suggested
BTS If the curious traveller will turn south from Glen Ellen he will find himself on a boulevard that is identical with the old country road seven centuries ago

BTS a second bragged six hundred for his dog
BTS True there were lines but they were the lines of decision and firmness
BTS The fear of death for myself and for others left me
BTS It was by an effort of will only that I was able to open my eyes and look at objects
BTS his attitude toward them was less compromising
BTS when they came to a narrow passage and the team closed together like a fan to go through
BTS Three times the hand essayed to write but fumbled hopelessly
BTS Jackson's arm was a fact of life
BTS Which is another way of expressing the joy of life in that it is alive the triumph of movement over matter of the quick over the dead the pride of the yeast because it is yeast and crawls
BTS He noticed that his cup was empty and started to reach for the pot
BTS I say what I think sir the sailor answered courageously not failing at the same time in ship courtesy which demanded that sir be appended to each speech he made
BTS Bah
BTS White Fang liked to lie at his feet on the wide porch when he read the newspaper from time to time favouring White Fang with a look or a word untroublesome tokens that he recognised White Fang's presence and existence
BTS You might help me she smiled
BTS Colonel Ingram rose high in the Oligarchy and became Minister to Germany
BTS When the proclaimed date arrived half a million soldiers were sent into the mountainous districts everywhere
BTS Suddenly he saw a strange thing like mist beginning to arise from the sticks and moss beneath Grey Beaver's hands
BTS while Dub an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught was punished for Buck's misdeed
BTS Such was his confidence that when a moose-bird impudently hopped up to him he reached out at it with a playful paw
BTS Colonel Ingram is leading counsel for the company

BTS And just now the word has gone forth that new levies are being imposed for the building of Asgard the projected wonder-city that will far exceed Ardis when the latter is completed
BTS Pig-ethics
BTS There it came now the god's hand cunning to hurt thrusting out at him descending upon his head
BTS And they drew pathetic pictures of what would be the sufferings of the working class were it not for the employment that they and they alone by their wisdom provided for it
BTS The carriage was bearing the master away
BTS But the memory of his mother held him
BTS This phenomenon was almost as common in the oligarch class and the labor castes as it was in the ranks of the revolutionists
BTS Wolf Larsen was furious
BTS He had reasoned himself into a spell of the blues and within few hours one could look for the devil within him to be up and stirring
BTS It was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come
BTS Again instructing Maud to slack away at the windlass when I gave the word I proceeded to heave on the watch-tackle
BTS We drew him back to his narrative
BTS All the drivers became interested in his case
BTS but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater the death of Curly the great fight with Spitz and the good things he had eaten or would like to eat
BTS There is one way I said grimly
BTS Send those two men aft Mr
BTS It marked further the decay or going to pieces of his moral nature a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for existence
BTS Bleeding and coughing already stricken he sprang at the elder and fought while life faded from him his legs going weak beneath him the light of day dulling on his eyes his blows and springs falling shorter and shorter
BTS As the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder
BTS Buck staggered over against the sled exhausted sobbing for breath helpless
BTS but this new and elemental environment seemed to call for a savage repression
BTS After the first surprise of greeting was over the Bishop leaned back in his chair stretched out his overall-covered legs and actually sighed a comfortable sigh
BTS As we drifted closer the boat would rise on a wave while we sank in the trough till almost straight above me I could see the heads of the three men craned overside and looking down
BTS Wolf Larsen and Henderson were standing near the wheel deep in conversation
BTS Something must be done must be done
BTS It was passed unanimously by the Senate on January 14 1903
BTS And then father was arrested for attempted assault fined in the police court and bound over to keep the peace
BTS What better evidence could be advanced to prove that education was dominated by the capitalist class
BTS The value of life
BTS Forgive me he said simply
BTS You do not agree with me
BTS And yet I aver it and I aver it again I was unafraid
BTS And when Beauty Smith left him tied outside the fort he knew that it was Beauty Smith's will that he should remain there
BTS In an hour what of this and of rests between the heaving I had hoisted it to the point where I could hoist no more
BTS At home I should undoubtedly have given vent to my anguish
BTS He learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between his toes
BTS Bill demanded triumphantly
BTS The laborers were called to work and dismissed by savage screaming nerve-racking steam-whistles
BTS His jaws slightly parted his lips lifted a little and a quizzical expression that was more love than humour came into his eyes
BTS The man on the box was Ernest
BTS It will be a deduction
BTS She appeared quite heart-broken over the discovery but recovered her spirits by coiling down tackles and halyards and all stray ropes
BTS and in that hole in the ground culture was higher and finer than in the palaces of wonder-cities of the oligarchs
BTS They declaimed about famine and pestilence as being scourges of God while the scientists were building granaries and draining cities

BTS And between these two desires is just where the soul of the man is manifest she went on
BTS Inoffensive ranchers in remote valleys were held up by armed men and compelled to identify themselves
BTS By 1895 they controlled one-fifth of the railway mileage of the country
BTS I finally crawled to my feet and ascended the companion stairs
BTS But my father died and I came to work in the mills
BTS that could snap and crackle points of fire like those which sparkle from a whirling sword
BTS It will not let you destroy the machines
BTS And so I say to the rich among you and to all the rich that bitterly you oppress the Master's lambs
BTS came down the open companion-way
BTS The life that is in you is alive and wants to go on being alive for ever
BTS But one day the master sprang from the carriage whip in hand and gave the stone-throwers a thrashing
BTS Also they gave advice
BTS I had devised an automatic jib-sheet which passed the jib across of itself so there was no need for Maud to attend to that
BTS and I felt sure the leg was broken
BTS It advertised itself in all his movements was apparent in the play of every muscle spoke plainly as speech in the way he carried himself and made his glorious furry coat if anything more glorious
BTS Eyes and eyebrows lips mouths and ears were radically altered
BTS He leaped a ditch went through a rail fence and fled across a field
BTS Through its spy-system the Iron Heel got wind of the Revolt and prepared to teach us another of its bloody lessons
BTS His shirt had been ripped entirely from him in the struggle and blood from a gash in the cheek was flowing down his naked chest marking a red path across his white thigh and dripping to the floor
BTS It was evident nothing had happened yet
BTS Wolf Larsen asked and I did no more work that day nor the next nor the next
BTS For no other reason has Anna Roylston refused blessed motherhood
BTS He had the gift of lucidity
BTS Then I had found myself attracted toward him
BTS Some Government must protect all these seals
BTS Twenty-four hours had passed since he had slashed open the hand that was now bandaged and held up by a sling to keep the blood out of it
BTS It burst and about his feet and mine bounced and rolled a flood of potatoes
BTS And bah
BTS The boat was cast adrift though one of them called it a bloody shame with Yokohama so near
BTS What vessel was it
BTS Nobody spoke
BTS The men ceased talking
BTS A warning snarl told him that the trespasser was Spitz
BTS Society has spoken
BTS Calmly turning his back upon young dog and shin-bone as though both were beneath his notice and unworthy of his consideration he stalked grandly away
BTS Her gaze was unfaltering but soft
BTS The pencil fell
BTS I held on to the weather rail close by the shrouds and gazed out across the desolate foaming waves to the low-lying fog-banks that hid San Francisco and the California coast
BTS It was a cheap and sordid thing after all this life and the sooner over the better
BTS Don't look Miss Brewster please don't look I had begged of her and I was glad that she had minded me and been spared the sight
BTS Maud suggested
BTS He broke into a run the team following his lead
BTS then you wouldn't be whipped
BTS He never joined the revolutionists
BTS The brain he said at once
BTS Of course a wolf that knows enough to come in with the dogs at feedin' time 'd know all about shooting-irons
BTS They successfully fought the damage suit he brought when he came out of hospital
BTS Why we'll be clamorous for something to do
BTS Get a move on
BTS Grand
BTS Ernest and the socialist leaders fought fiercely to capture the farmers
BTS He ran back to her licked her face and ran on again
BTS Wait and you will see he answered grimly
BTS After that grateful and content White Fang lay at Grey Beaver's feet gazing at the fire that warmed him blinking and dozing secure in the knowledge that the morrow would find him not wandering forlorn through bleak forest-stretches but in the camp of the man-animals with the gods to whom he had given himself and upon whom he was now dependent
BTS The god's hand had come out and was descending upon his head
BTS Beauty Smith cowered down in anticipation of the blow
BTS Louis came aft to relieve the wheel
BTS He seemed pleased at my perspicacity
BTS Why should he not hate them
BTS Then he was aroused by Grey Beaver's voice calling him by name
BTS It does not matter young or old man or woman high or low genius or clod go where one will among the comrades of the Revolution the motor-force will be found to be a great and abiding desire for the right
BTS But what he had expected was nothing to what he realised
BTS He was stronger than I that was all
BTS Feet with which to clutch the ground legs to stand on and to help withstand while with arms and hands teeth and nails I struggle to kill and to be not killed
BTS But I did see the balloon suddenly leap up into the sky
BTS But making an extra trip to the galley a little later I was gladdened by the sight of Harrison staggering weakly from the rigging to the forecastle scuttle
BTS So I hailed with delight the little traits that proclaimed her only woman after all such as the toss of the head which flung back the cloud of hair and the search for the pin
BTS He avoided them and passed down the porch but they cornered him against a rocking-chair and the railing
BTS Without discussion it was the agents-provocateurs who caused the Peasant Revolt
BTS I read more than that I continued boldly
BTS An' 'ere I am now
BTS Yes sir came the answer of a spirit cowed
BTS From your own figures we of the middle class are more powerful than labor Mr
BTS Even the protest of Standish arose out of the fact that he did not wish to lose his boat-puller
BTS And the sleuth-hounds of the law the paid fighting animals of society with telephone and telegraph and special train clung to his trail night and day
BTS Hot words passed
BTS His allegiance to man seemed somehow a law of his being greater than the love of liberty of kind and kin
BTS He turned to Ernest
BTS I turned to re-examine Thomas Mugridge's work
BTS The hubbub died down
BTS The dreaded white god was not there
BTS I brought up violently against what I took to be the rail breathed and breathed the sweet air again
BTS But at the same time there was a suspicious crackling movement beside him and his astonished eye saw a young spruce sapling bending down above him to strike him
BTS Once the cub sprang in and sank his teeth into the hind leg of the lynx
BTS Here was danger some treachery or something
BTS It strikes me as remarkable to say the least that you should show enthusiasm I answered coldly
BTS It will certainly fix it Mr
BTS His mother had satisfied her hunger elsewhere
BTS It seemed impossible that it could continue to live yet with each dizzying sweep it did achieve the impossible
BTS He never barked
BTS She brushed her nose with her paws trying to dislodge the fiery darts thrust it into the snow and rubbed it against twigs and branches and all the time leaping about ahead sidewise up and down in a frenzy of pain and fright
BTS This is the revolution my masters
BTS And when I pleaded guilty but defended the act as highly rational he but pressed me closer and laughed as only one of God's own lovers could laugh
BTS It did not take him long to make up his mind
BTS But I've stayed by the company through two strikes
BTS It would have been far better if you had Ernest said gravely
BTS It stirred one like the onset of battle
BTS They had been hogging the sea and they knew Wolf Larsen by reputation at any rate
BTS Night came on and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day
BTS Buck saw money pass between them and was not surprised when Curly a good-natured Newfoundland and he were led away by the little weazened man
BTS Only fools with the blind luck of fools could have made it
BTS The nightmare city was gone
BTS You should have seen him before then
BTS He seemed made to run on for ever
BTS I can ponder life and death like a Hindoo sage
BTS And yet it was not physically painful
BTS I know I can see it you have among other ways been used to managing people with your eyes letting your moral courage speak out through them as it were
BTS It was at the Philomath Club--a wonderful night of battle wherein Ernest bearded the masters in their lair
BTS No need to go to any great trouble for me she protested when I had seated her in Wolf Larsen's arm-chair which I had dragged hastily from his cabin
BTS And then so strange was the dream there was a crash
BTS In those early days the agents of the Iron Heel were clumsy in their methods
BTS Disappearance was one of the horrors of the time
BTS CHAPTER VI THE FAMINE The spring of the year was at hand when Grey Beaver finished his long journey
BTS but a certain measure of controlled anger he allowed himself
BTS Yes and no sir was the slow reply
BTS They played for money
BTS To be sure White Fang only felt these things
BTS Dave was fair and very wise
BTS I did not see it myself but my assistants first one and then the other deserted me for a few moments to run amidships and look at what was going on
BTS In addition to the labor castes there arose another caste the military
BTS and at the sound of his voice the whole circle was agitated there was a general snarl and the she-wolf slid up close to him across the snow and watched him with hungry wistfulness
BTS There was nothing in them and yet there was much in them for those skilled in reading between the lines that it was intended the ordinary reader should read into the text
BTS Louis the boat-steerer had already begged me for condensed milk and sugar
BTS We looked at each other and our hands felt their way and clasped
BTS The yelping died away
BTS Such was the impression of strength I gathered from this man who paced up and down
BTS Now what do you do
BTS My nerves were shocked
BTS Van Weyden
BTS The editors were afraid of him and the publishers would have none of him
BTS Then the business game is to make profits out of others and to prevent others from making profits out of you
BTS and in that moment he struck them on the shoulder rolling them off their feet and delivering his stroke at the throat
BTS Filling a coffee-pot and frying-pan with part of my plunder and taking some chinaware from the cabin pantry I left Wolf Larsen lying in the sun and went ashore
BTS His lost eye and his scarred muzzle bore evidence to the nature of his experience
BTS He could not loose his war-dogs
BTS In short a sudden colossal stunning blow was to be struck
BTS the faro-dealer demanded
BTS The birds talked of it the squirrels chattered about it the very breeze whispered of it
BTS In the centre of the space it had occupied he sat down
BTS Matt uttered a great oath and sprang to his side
BTS And I shall know that I must die at sea most likely cease crawling of myself to be all a-crawl with the corruption of the sea
BTS Morning broke dull and grey but calm and I was awake early and had the boat in readiness
BTS He backed away stiff-legged with self-consciousness and tried to go around her
BTS Also it was asserted by more than one paper that father's mind had weakened under the strain of scientific study and confinement in a state asylum for the insane was suggested
BTS By extortionate you mean large
BTS His arm by the way has healed nicely though the scar will remain all his life
BTS The battle began fairly but it did not end fairly
BTS I held up my hand as she was about to speak
BTS It dawned upon me that of course the company could afford finer legal talent than could a workingman like Jackson
BTS And greater than the trusts and more powerful is labor
BTS But if they could fast prodigiously they could feed prodigiously and soon a few scattered bones were all that remained of the splendid live brute that had faced the pack a few hours before
BTS Why was he beaten out of heaven
BTS All the same we'll go on to Dawson
BTS Now I shall see and learn for myself
BTS The publication of the book had immediately caused a bit of excitement in the country
BTS There were a myriad devices for catching dust and only a few devices for getting rid of it
BTS He had always disliked to have it touched
BTS From one of those countless windows the bomb had been thrown but which window
BTS These limitations and restraints were laws
BTS The code he learned was to obey the strong and to oppress the weak
BTS A strange a terribly strange region was unrolling itself before my eyes
BTS Then he turned deliberately and took the right fork
BTS The family was on the porch taking the cool of the afternoon when White Fang arrived
BTS Then on the morning of the fourth day two men from the States came along and bought them harness and all for a song
BTS Every one of such countries has an unconsumed surplus
BTS Then she smiled
BTS In the stern-sheets I found a rusty ten-gauge shot-gun and a sailor's sheath-knife broken short across and so rusted as to be almost unrecognizable
BTS Hello
BTS Also a low growl rumbled in his throat as warning that he was not to be trifled with
BTS and Buck still at the head of the team but no longer enforcing discipline or striving to enforce it blind with weakness half the time and keeping the trail by the loom of it and by the dim feel of his feet
BTS I knew all this because I read 'Seaside Library' novels in which with the exception of the villains and adventuresses all men and women thought beautiful thoughts spoke a beautiful tongue and performed glorious deeds
BTS You have talked of the instinct of immortality
BTS He had no arms with which to attack me from a distance
BTS I have been looking up Jackson's case I said abruptly
BTS In the end while Beauty Smith beat White Fang back with a club the mastiff was dragged out by its owner
BTS The money
BTS Wasn't it er Crusoe who rubbed sticks together
BTS I was all alone
BTS Our conclusion is merely presumptive
BTS The strain was too great
BTS I think I too cried aloud as I drew the knife at my hip and sprang forward a second time
BTS Van Weyden she said
BTS She had known better than the blundering gods
BTS For nearly twenty years now John Carlson has been custodian of the refuge
BTS Weedon's back Weedon's mother announced
BTS I saw his eyes flash golden as he spoke and I saw the terror mount in her own
BTS I had fallen asleep in that state of nerve tension with which one meets the continuous shock of sound or movement and I had awakened still tense bracing myself to meet the pressure of something which no longer bore upon me
BTS Think it'll ride
BTS This with the single block and the throat-halyards themselves gave me a hoisting tackle
BTS but what it was he could not discover
BTS Even as he spoke a bullet was deflected by a brass-capped spoke of the wheel between his hands and screeched off through the air to windward
BTS You see my argument is so clear and simple that in your own minds you carry it on for me
BTS What chance had he to be anything else than he was
BTS The document was certainly important enough to find its way to Rome
BTS A dense volume of smoke was pouring out of the steerage companion-way
BTS He ran always on her right side
BTS It is said that the chief of this staff has a salary of 125000 a year
BTS Dave and Sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership
BTS Bibles and Prayer-books seemed scarce articles but one of the men volunteered to pursue the quest amongst the watch below returning in a minute with the information that there was none
BTS Dead men's hands have kept it soft
BTS And thereafter I lived nightmare
BTS As rigid as the sled-discipline of the gods was the discipline maintained by White Fang amongst his fellows
BTS And the next day found them still running
BTS There are still two billions to be accounted for which labor cannot buy back and consume
BTS She was strong
BTS He came out of the tangle a spectacle of malignancy ears flattened back lips writhing nose wrinkling his teeth clipping together as the fangs barely missed the hound's soft throat
BTS Air-holes formed fissures sprang and spread apart while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into the river
BTS In a lofty way he received the attentions of the multitudes of strange gods
BTS Furtively instinctively I slunk back behind the table and drew and cocked my revolver
BTS He plunged through the wooded breast of the island flew down to the lower end crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island gained a third island curved back to the main river and in desperation started to cross it
BTS The calm and control which were so much a part of her seemed to have been communicated to the blankets so that I was aware of a soft dreaminess and content and of an oval face and brown eyes framed in a fisherman's cap and tossing against a background now of grey cloud now of grey sea and then I was aware that I had been asleep
BTS As never before he felt his dependence on the love-master close at whose heels he followed no matter what happened never losing sight of him
BTS Sad though this night's happening will be I feel that it will but draw you more closely to me
BTS Before me in the bottom of the boat lay Maud
BTS I think I'll sit down
BTS I'm not worth that much
BTS I am not versed in the courtesies of ecclesiastical controversy he began and then hesitated with modesty and indecision
BTS The desire to close had always been mutual
BTS Walled by the living clay that fierce intelligence we had known burned on
BTS Through the windows of the private car I caught a glimpse of three men whom I recognized
BTS He chummed with the laborers and was an intimate in scores of homes
BTS Calm and sure they were as her spirit itself
BTS As they swung on the turn the sled went over spilling half its load through the loose lashings
BTS And what little there was the slapping of a few reef-points and the creaking of a sheave in a block or two was ghostly under the hollow echoing pall in which we were swathed
BTS I threw up my hands with helpless disapproval of his inveterate materialism and went about making the bed
BTS Murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up
BTS And without asking Whither hurried hence
BTS Their testimony as he put it wasn't what it ought to have ben
BTS There's no one to stop you
BTS We were waiting for him to do something to show his hand so to say and his inaction puzzled and worried us
BTS No wrathful Macedonia broke its surface nor blackened the sky with her smoke
BTS While this went on and Beauty Smith continued to kick White Fang there was a commotion in the crowd
BTS Cautiously descending I found the cabin deserted
BTS I pointed out that modern man's producing power through social organization and the use of machinery was a thousand times greater than that of the cave-man
BTS They killed him
BTS He abruptly turned on his heel and started forward
BTS Wickson looked at me sharply when I closed the door on him and muttered 'Well I'll be damned
BTS Bernard had been the Judge's inseparable companion and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father
BTS Three times four times and half a dozen times his sharp little teeth scored on the newcomer until White Fang yelping shamelessly fled to the protection of his mother
BTS Death meant nothing life meant nothing
BTS Five minutes later the landscape was covered with fleeing boys many of whom dripped blood upon the snow in token that White Fang's teeth had not been idle
BTS The dog-driver held the axe poised in his hand and as Buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad Dolly's head
BTS He never allowed them any latitude
BTS Twice I saw the hunter let go the steering-oar with one hand reach for his rifle and hesitate
BTS Children six and seven years of age working every night at twelve-hour shifts
BTS Buck did not like her but he was feeling too miserable to resist her taking it as part of the day's miserable work
BTS Hartman ran to the gutter and stooped over the object
BTS The beginning of such a fight was a signal for all the young dogs in camp to come running and pitch upon him
BTS But so many were the men who had rushed into the Klondike and so many were the sweethearts wives and kin that had not rushed in that the congested mail was taking on Alpine proportions
BTS Unlike any animals he had ever encountered they did not bite nor claw
BTS Yet during those first days of our love fear of the future came often to me when I thought of the violence and impetuosity of his love-making
BTS We plump forgot the window
BTS CHAPTER XXII I knew what it was as she came toward me
BTS I understand I said
BTS The very world was not
BTS During the time that Kiche was tied by the stick he ran about over all the camp inquiring investigating learning
BTS O hero
BTS Something wriggled under his feet
BTS I promise you a great caterwauling and an illuminating insight into the nature of the beast
BTS It was a nauseous mess ship's coffee but the heat of it was revivifying
BTS Yes I do
BTS This lasted several minutes and White Fang was beginning to enjoy it as a sort of game
BTS Ballingford achieved quite different fates from that of Jackson
BTS In the top one lay Oofty-Oofty a Kanaka and splendid seaman so named by his mates
BTS That's a good sign
BTS The blood of little children and of strong men is dripping from your very roof-beams
BTS It  But at this juncture Mugridge who had lifted his head and ascertained the extent of his loss floundered over on the deck and buried his teeth in Wolf Larsen's leg
BTS At the same moment other comrades were to blow up the bridges and tunnels and disrupt the whole network of railroads
BTS White Fang darted in and out unscathed while Cherokee's wounds increased
BTS He set to work to carry out a new idea that had come to him
BTS And if I were you I'd hunt cover right now
BTS He looked upon our slum neighborhood as a great sociological laboratory and he had embarked upon an apparently endless orgy of investigation
BTS They too were silent their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward
BTS You get a nap and I'll reconnoitre
BTS There came a time when not only did the meat-supply cease but the milk no longer came from his mother's breast
BTS And then on the crowded sidewalks there were persons innumerable whose attention he attracted
BTS It's you that'll have to come inside
BTS Hats and mittens were flying in the air
BTS I was well-nigh choking and my eyes were certainly fiery
BTS Outside the pen men would be gathering and he knew that a fight was on
BTS Where is the line between wrong mind and insane mind
BTS We want all that you possess
BTS Then the calf of his leg was badly lacerated and looked as though it had been mangled by a bulldog
BTS He shaved hairs from the back of his hand glanced along the edge with microscopic acuteness and found or feigned that he found always a slight inequality in its edge somewhere
BTS But there came a time when the god refused to toss it
BTS I'll run down an' tyke a look over my kit if you've no objections sir to wearin' my things
BTS Ah look at that
BTS And then without rhyme or reason all sceptical my mind flew back to a small biographical note in the red-bound Who's Who and I said to myself She was born in Cambridge and she is twenty-seven years old
BTS White Fang could see nothing dangerous in that
BTS Several things favored him in this
BTS Look at him now
BTS Ernest demanded
BTS Well Miss Brewster there is nothing small about the Ghost
BTS While the sight of a moose-bird almost invariably put him into the wildest of rages
BTS I see him yet standing there like a pigmy out of the Arabian Nights before the huge front of some malignant genie
BTS This was a false syllogism that conclusion had no connection with the premise while that next premise was an impostor because it had cunningly hidden in it the conclusion that was being attempted to be proved
BTS The meat was good meat and White Fang was hungry
BTS How long does it take you
BTS It was a slight uphill climb for the foresail peaked high
BTS Right of way
BTS Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose
BTS But at the sight of him the five men did not spring to their feet nor show their teeth nor snarl
BTS One portion was what his own kind killed and ate
BTS Not that I a confirmed and as Furuseth phrased it a temperamental idealist was to be compelled
BTS He would I have always been proud of the fact that I discovered him I said turning the conversation as Wolf Larsen stepped on the poop and joined us
BTS You have already forgotten what we had agreed upon Ernest replied
BTS Then he stopped undecided and looked back over his shoulder
BTS And now
BTS It was to the death
BTS Have you sighted land yet
BTS She stitched slowly but never did she cease from stitching
BTS He alone among men could put a pack upon Buck's back in the summer travelling
BTS Or again he would be in the pen of Beauty Smith
BTS Day broke and found me wan-eyed and the ocean lashed white the boat pitching almost on end to its drag
BTS After the strike on the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1877 he broached a scheme to have the Locomotive Engineers make terms with the railroads and to go it alone so far as the rest of the labor unions were concerned
BTS You little thought when you trusted yourself to me that I had had no experience whatever with small boats
BTS I cannot bear to think of it being done
BTS His hair was standing out all over him in tufts where her teeth had mauled
BTS This command I obeyed
BTS The hand lifted and descended again in a patting caressing movement
BTS The Philomath had no club house
BTS the Black Hundreds appearing in scores of wide-scattered places had destroyed property
BTS The very simplicity of his reasoning was its strength and his materialism was far more compelling than the subtly complex materialism of Charley Furuseth
BTS Whoso enlists on the side of competition perishes
BTS We found our socialist comrades confident optimistic of their strength and of the things they would accomplish
BTS No anger nor bitterness possessed him
BTS Value
BTS It would be better I imagine if you let harems alone and devoted your attention to lonely and inoffensive-looking seals was what she said
BTS Think not that you will escape being penalized
BTS So I thought it out at the time feeling the need for vindication and desiring to be at peace with my conscience
BTS I waited patiently
BTS In mid air just as his jaws were about to close on the man he received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip
BTS That's their way
BTS And having commanded he went aft with his peculiar tigerish leaps to the wheel
BTS The cheeks were sunken and there was a wearied puckered expression on the brow
BTS Here I have been composing my soul to do without it and here you are vexing me with your vain suggestions
BTS He sauntered slowly forward to the break of the poop and leaning his elbow on the corner of the cabin gazed down thoughtfully and curiously at the excited boy
BTS but the masters the hunters and the captain were heartlessly indifferent
BTS Forgotten were the days they had hunted together the game they had pulled down the famine they had suffered
BTS but Francois was a French-Canadian half-breed and twice as swarthy
BTS My hair was down and flying and from the stinging of the scalp I managed to recollect a hand in the press of the entrance that had torn at my hair
BTS but Grey Beaver did not caress nor speak kind words
BTS There was something in that clarion-call of his that went to my heart
BTS What was the matter
BTS Call it the shadow of an oligarchy if you will
BTS In half-an-hour I sighted the second one swamped and bottom up to which were desperately clinging Jock Horner fat Louis and Johnson
BTS It was the biceps that had nearly crushed out my life once that I had seen strike so many killing blows
BTS You have to be very careful as to how you spend your earnings I suggested
BTS He was executed by the Iron Heel in 1928 A
BTS I heard Maud cry in dismay and suddenly stop
BTS Grey Beaver looked on stolidly while the white man wielded the whip
BTS When I had dressed and opened the door I heard the waves still lapping on the beach garrulously attesting the fury of the night
BTS Despite our refusal to grant permission to do the deed she went on with it
BTS There were cries of Sedition
BTS His marriage with my mother had been very happy and in the researches of his own science physics he had been very happy
BTS The test the test Dr
BTS For the first time in my life I experienced the desire to murder saw red as some of our picturesque writers phrase it
BTS As the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the aid of their beset leader
BTS Surely it is a waste of time to elaborate these A B C's of commerce Mr
BTS I shook my head and paused in the act of dislodging the shavings which had drifted down my neck
BTS By the way how much was it that Cooky got away with
BTS Did you know that you were brave
BTS And in that moment so complete had been my transformation I discovered it was only by an effort of will that I could be the old Avis Everhard with the old mannerisms and smiles phrases and intonations of voice
BTS And you
BTS There are seals here he said
BTS I have yet to tell of the stirring times of the winter of 1912
BTS There was just the faintest wind from the westward
BTS He had begun to limp and this limp increased with the hours
BTS Here was the ancient marauder up to his old tricks again
BTS but the food had come too late for her
BTS He was continually marred and scarred by the teeth of the pack and as continually he left his own marks upon the pack
BTS For some unknown reason prompted mysteriously I did not undress but lay down fully clothed
BTS The terrific gong was a frying-pan hanging on the wall that rattled and clattered with each leap of the ship
BTS We loved love and our love was never smirched by anything less than the best
BTS I hid him and tonight I will go back and bury him deep
BTS He spoke of his birth in the working class and of the sordidness and wretchedness of his environment where flesh and spirit were alike starved and tormented
BTS But the Oligarchy was too confident in those days
BTS Search as we may through all the material of those times that has come down to us we can find no clew to the Biedenbach here referred to
BTS Nothing was safe unless guarded
BTS If you are right I said then we must prepare to winter here
BTS Try to go peaceably on your way and you run into a mob and are killed by machine-guns or you run into the Mercenaries and are killed by your own comrades from a roof
BTS Lie down sir
BTS Second is the middle class your class gentlemen which is composed of farmers merchants small manufacturers and professional men
BTS He was brilliant but so was Maud and for some time I lost the thread of the conversation through studying her face as she talked
BTS The canoe shoved off
BTS He studied her his eyes rarely leaving her face unless to follow the movements of her hands or shoulders
BTS He waited at a distance
BTS And within him it aroused feelings which he had likewise never experienced before
BTS I felt the same alarm that I had felt when James Smith broke out
BTS I had no fear of death
BTS The newspapers published information of an unprecedented rise in wages and shortening of hours for the railroad employees the iron and steel workers and the engineers and machinists
BTS They were machine-serfs and labor-serfs
BTS Johnson the man who had chafed me raw when I first came aboard seemed the least equivocal of the men forward or aft
BTS Highly as the dog-driver had forevalued Buck with his two devils he found while the day was yet young that he had undervalued
BTS Next to obtain was a stock of ammunition an easy matter though I had to enter the steerage companion-way to do it
BTS When I announced who I was I was promptly placed under arrest
BTS We were not far off the line the wind made with the western edge of the promontory and I watched in the hope that some set of the current or send of the sea would drift us past before we reached the surf
BTS but in the few words he had held with me it had been clear and correct
BTS It was early in the days of his persecution that he played his first really big crafty game and got there from his first taste of revenge
BTS A scamper across the pasture a jackrabbit rising suddenly under the horse's feet a violent sheer a stumble a fall to earth and a broken leg for the master was the cause of it
BTS He could fight
BTS A devilish pandemonium reigned--shrieks curses and cries of death while above all rose the churning rattle of machine-guns and the put-a-put put-a-put of rifles
BTS He would be lying in camp dozing lazily in the heat of the day when suddenly his head would lift and his ears cock up intent and listening and he would spring to his feet and dash away and on and on for hours through the forest aisles and across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched
BTS I hadn't the ghost of a chance
BTS They could not continue their method of producing surpluses
BTS Calvin confessed
BTS I demanded
BTS then I stole into the cabin for my marmalade and underclothes slipped back past the galley and climbed down to the beach to deliver my barefoot report
BTS There was an emphasis on the tried and a pleading little note in her voice
BTS I'm slow
BTS They woke me up with their barking or I'd be sleeping yet
BTS to be fed upon to be carrion to yield up all the strength and movement of my muscles that it may become strength and movement in fin and scale and the guts of fishes
BTS They moved at once to the head of the room from where he was to speak
BTS A-a-ah
BTS Van Weyden was the Cockney's fervent ejaculation
BTS The power of subsidization of thought was theirs to a remarkable degree as I was soon to learn under Ernest's tuition
BTS I have you to thank for showing me my path
BTS The near bank was a yard away
BTS and so potent was the spell of Wolf Larsen on my imagination I was quite prepared for the helpless giant to grip my neck in a strangle hold
BTS Wolf just wolf 'tis what he is
BTS If you are braver than I am I more cowardly than you
BTS But the right
BTS This is directly in line with the fact that the bomb was lightly charged and that its explosion at Everhard's feet was not deadly
BTS We can't afford to lose no more animals
BTS Other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a sense of duty and business expediency
BTS I shall pay you whatever you judge your delay and trouble to be worth
BTS He had been used always to the laboratory and so it was that he turned the dining room into a sociological laboratory
BTS His voice was less harsh and wholly sincere as he said You must be happy you sentimentalists really and truly happy at dreaming and finding things good and because you find some of them good feeling good yourself
BTS And Buck ran with them side by side with the wild brother yelping as he ran
BTS Several days passed during which I read Ernest's books borrowed from my father
BTS The situation is indeed serious Mr
BTS Such an army of revolution he said twenty-five millions strong is a thing to make rulers and ruling classes pause and consider
BTS It was to this that was fastened the long rope by which he pulled at the sled
BTS With a turn for literary expression myself and a penchant for forcible figures and phrases I appreciated as no other listener I dare say the peculiar vividness and strength and absolute blasphemy of his metaphors
BTS declared unconstitutional the law prohibiting minors and women from working in factories after nine o'clock at night the ground taken being that such a law was class legislation
BTS He no longer marched
BTS Bill demanded
BTS And in open court-room before all men Jim Hall had proclaimed that the day would come when he would wreak vengeance on the Judge that sentenced him
BTS And I shall not go so far but what I can get back before night
BTS I ain't a-goin' to be robbed
BTS Why not fasten the tackle part way down the mast
BTS They never had a moment's rest or peace
BTS Thus he was on duty all the time ever vigilant and faithful the most valuable of all the dogs
BTS Whether it was my love for Ernest or the clear sight he had given me of the society in which I lived that made me a revolutionist I know not
BTS The sparkle and bubble has gone out and it is a tasteless drink
BTS At the instant his voice broke the silence White Fang leaped back snarling savagely at him
BTS Calling to Maud to cease lowering I went on deck and made the watch-tackle fast to the mast with a rolling hitch
BTS Assassination or something kindred
BTS He called up his reserves of strength and gained his feet
BTS The poor little hero
BTS He could not forget in a day all the evil that had been wrought him at the hands of men
BTS His lips had become distorted into a permanent snarl which at mere sight of Wolf Larsen broke out in sound horrible and menacing and I do believe unconsciously
BTS the void in him sprang up and pressed against him with its emptiness and the hunger gnawed and gnawed unceasingly
BTS What is it you can do
BTS Love of the right desire for the right unhappiness with anything less than the right--in short right conduct is the prime factor of religion
BTS They spread out and struck a northerly course across the ocean
BTS I felt like crying aloud as I looked at him Great Bishop
BTS When I had gained the ladder I turned to the circle of brutal and malignant faces peering at me through the semi-darkness
BTS Meynell was living the life of a savage and living it quite successfully I said easily
BTS Now by Gar I feex you
BTS An hour of this passed when the vibrations of feet in contact with the ground foreran the one who approached
BTS In the United States Census of 1900 the last census the figures of which were made public the number of child laborers was placed at 1752187
BTS Dave he was called and he ate and slept or yawned between times and took interest in nothing not even when the Narwhal crossed Queen Charlotte Sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed
BTS Do you remember how in six months the Tobacco Trust squeezed out over four hundred cigar stores in New York City alone
BTS His lips were flecked with a soapy froth and sometimes he choked and gurgled and became inarticulate
BTS I thought my right hand had done it--only it didn't
BTS And now the next point
BTS And in her zeal when she had finished with her own she attacked the belongings of her men and went through them like a tornado
BTS This herding movement was practically a failure thanks to the splendid work of the comrades
BTS His conclusion was that things were not always what they appeared to be
BTS Ergo to the asylum with him
BTS Labor in all these countries has spent its wages and cannot buy any of the surpluses
BTS The latter bayoneted the struggling wretches though one I saw who gained his feet and flew at a soldier's throat with his teeth
BTS Are they sacred things
BTS But I was not born Norwegian
BTS Had it not done this I know that I should have died
BTS Then from above I heard a sound of scrambling
BTS God
BTS The men slept breathing heavily side by side under the one covering
BTS She was consigned to the Napa Asylum
BTS Yes I have was his reply
BTS And as he left me I was aware of the same desire at my heart
BTS They may dose me and doctor me morning noon and night and dust and sweep and put my den to rights every minute of the day and I shall only lean back and survey it all and be thankful in that I am possessed of a mother and some several sisters
BTS Weakness is wrong
BTS She turned aside and trotted over to it
BTS I countered
BTS For a long time these mutterings and rumblings had been heard
BTS And in this his brothers and sisters were one with him
BTS we never saw them again and we knew that they had died
BTS Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down
BTS I know though I didn't spot him at it
BTS It was frightful
BTS It is beyond price which you will acknowledge is a terrific overrating but which I cannot help for it is the life that is in me that makes the rating
BTS The water was cold so cold that it was painful
BTS True he is not what you would term muscular but still he has muscles which is more than he had when he came aboard
BTS For was not Kiche my brother's dog
BTS But a friendly little yelp reassured him and he went back to investigate
BTS The man sprang for his throat but Buck was too quick for him
BTS We smiled again said amusing things and waxed optimistic over our situation
BTS A revulsion of feeling came over me
BTS This rush ceased abruptly
BTS Since we knew nothing about the bomb and since a bomb actually was exploded and since the authorities had prepared in advance for the explosion it is only fair to conclude that the Iron Heel did know
BTS And there is no reason that the division should not be amicable
BTS I cannot move arm or leg
BTS Don't let him know that we know
BTS Then he slowly sank down and the soldiers reached him
BTS They were mere skeletons draped loosely in draggled hides with blazing eyes and slavered fangs
BTS Let me go with you I volunteered
BTS for the general strike was a political strike
BTS Whereupon the other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes and he would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep
BTS The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost and they seemed to lean towards each other black and ominous in the fading light
BTS Another night Dub and Joe fought Spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved
BTS Hans snubbed the rope around the tree and Buck and Thornton were jerked under the water
BTS You said to give him a chance
BTS Not only was she overthrown
BTS It was later in the day that he took me in his arms manifesting great embarrassment and claiming polygamous emotions
BTS He did not rob openly but stole secretly and cunningly out of respect for club and fang
BTS Their privation and hardships were terrible but they persisted
BTS Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck
BTS The rest of the men were morose and silent
BTS Without haste with the air of one resigned to misfortune Bill turned his head and from where he sat counted the dogs
BTS However I could see that the boldness of his language had affected Miss Brentwood
BTS He too had risen and he stood facing her where she had paused at the door of her room as he went on Here at least We shall be free
BTS Such was the lesson that was quickly borne in upon him
BTS Ernest paused looked at him searchingly and accepted the challenge
BTS He met her next rush with his chest in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet
BTS They were alert and active anxious that the work should go well and fiercely irritable with whatever by delay or confusion retarded that work
BTS A panic seized all of them and they scattered in every direction running in blind terror the wounded officer roughly dropped being left behind
BTS Van Weyden speaks with the voice of authority Wolf Larsen laughed
BTS Bill cautiously slipped the gun from under the sled-lashing
BTS White Fang bristling silently half-crouching as he rose sank back and watched the hostile act repeated
BTS He would have made a good scientist if his energies had been directed that way
BTS But I was angry with Wolf Larsen
BTS and in the centre of the clearing stood Buck motionless as a statue waiting their coming
BTS He had a feeling that the testimony of the foremen and the superintendent had brought about the adverse decision of the court
BTS The sight of her dear wet cheeks her flying hair and her brave brown eyes convinced me that my vision was still healthy
BTS I'd like to believe you he answered shaking my hand but I can't
BTS Then all the boys attacked Mit-sah
BTS It would be wise to make the boat fast Maud said
BTS Was he too destined for a cross
BTS She was made glad in vague ways by the battle for this was the love-making of the Wild the sex-tragedy of the natural world that was tragedy only to those that died
BTS As he gave up and stumbled inside his circle a wolf leaped for him missed and landed with all four feet in the coals
BTS It must not be mistaken for an attack upon the Catholic Church
BTS He was always a little demon of fury when he chanced upon a stray ptarmigan
BTS Such a recoil is like that of a hair made to grow out from the body turning unnaturally upon the direction of its growth and growing into the body a rankling festering thing of hurt
BTS I shouted up to Latimer
BTS He talked ambiguously and was so apprehensive of what I might say that I had not the heart to catechise him
BTS Nevertheless there was the mortgage properly and legally drawn up and signed with a record of the payments of interest through a number of years
BTS Ernest abruptly changed front
BTS You are better educated than most workingmen I said
BTS The statistics of this division are fractional
BTS Father must have had strong in him the blood of adventure
BTS but it's the best we can do
BTS I was not surprised when I had my talk out with Mrs
BTS The people who had owned the soil had been driven away
BTS And I too was mad
BTS But in spite of his meekness and lowliness I fancied I caught the first note of a nascent bitterness in him when he said They might a-given me a job as watchman anyway
BTS One Eye came to her
BTS I suppose that was why in spite of my twenty-four years I had not married
BTS You have a firm and abiding belief that you were created for the sole purpose of making profits
BTS was his opening salutation
BTS It breaks off abruptly in the middle of a sentence
BTS an' I wouldn't do it over for a thousand cold cash
BTS As it is it's in a nasty prison and you'll do him only a kindness by breaking down the door
BTS How the scene comes back to me
BTS You have worked hard and nobly
BTS The boat sheered out with a rush and the hunter steadied it to a parallel course some twenty feet from the side of the Ghost
BTS Oh nothing Wolf Larsen said lamely
BTS Black duplicated the performance a moment later with the other foot
BTS They could not advance over that wave of dead and the idea was to run them down the cross street
BTS He struck after his custom without warning
BTS But as you are not Mr
BTS The information is quite correct I answered
BTS He was speaking rapidly now and his eyes were flashing
BTS but already had the segregation of classes proceeded so far that the members of the middle class never heard of the pamphlet at all and so remained in ignorance of the law
BTS Yet we were fair
BTS He gave a short chuckle
BTS The natives died of starvation by the million while their rulers robbed them of the fruits of their toil and expended it on magnificent pageants and mumbo-jumbo fooleries
BTS Don't take no chances
BTS The western half of the sky had by now grown murky
BTS Had I been father or brother the situation would have been in nowise different
BTS The day had been dull and overcast but the sun now burst through the clouds a welcome omen and shone upon the curving beach where together we had dared the lords of the harem and slain the holluschickie
BTS Even at that time I flattered myself that I played some part in causing his visits and it was not long before I learned the correctness of my surmise
BTS If not amity at least neutrality must obtain
BTS As it began to flame up the circle of eyes drew farther back
BTS I cried out overcome with the horror of it
BTS Joshua made the sun stand still upon Gibeon but you would outdo Joshua
BTS called the strange man in the carriage
BTS Straight over Sonoma Mountain we rode
BTS Collie clasped in the arms of one of the women watched him jealously and with a snarl warned him that all was not well
BTS and before we left her the Bishop had built the fire while I had peeled the potatoes and put them on to boil
BTS His teeth closed on Spitz's left fore leg
BTS Do you see this
BTS An hour went by and a second hour
BTS From time to time it rocked back and forward as with pain
BTS Truly she was my woman my mate-woman fighting with me and for me as the mate of a caveman would have fought all the primitive in her aroused forgetful of her culture hard under the softening civilization of the only life she had ever known
BTS So large was his following that he managed to take possession of the empty shell of the old Democratic Party
BTS He could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face
BTS There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean
BTS Spitz was wild with wrath
BTS Wolf Larsen shouted himself springing to the wheel and whirling it over
BTS He is as Lucifer would be were that proud spirit banished to a society of soulless Tomlinsonian ghosts
BTS Common school education so far as they were concerned had ceased
BTS What desires
BTS Are you going to take up your duties as cabin-boy
BTS Wolf Larsen put his finger to his lips as a sign for silence and the eyes closed again
BTS But the whole truth was not told
BTS Johnson Wolf Larsen said with an air of dismissing all that had gone before as introductory to the main business in hand I understand you're not quite satisfied with those oilskins
BTS And I promise I won't use any more physical demonstrations
BTS Larsen but you must grant that the bravery is mine
BTS The man's mine and I'll make soup of him and eat it if I want to
BTS And another such sea meant the end
BTS It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Johansen
BTS Having let them have their say Ernest began asking questions right and left
BTS White Fang turned to the love-master's wife
BTS As I sat in my bunk examining it the six hunters were all in the steerage smoking and talking in loud voices Henderson took a passing glance at it
BTS Hush
BTS Here a yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the ground with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun
BTS He was a poet
BTS From then on night and day Buck never left his prey never gave it a moment's rest never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the shoots of young birch and willow
BTS Then I told him the whole circumstance how my clothes had been left to dry in the galley and how later I was nearly beaten by the cook when I mentioned the matter
BTS The people of the abyss were tormented out of their apathy
BTS At first the surge back upon us was crushing but as the killing continued the pressure was eased
BTS You surely have the answer forthcoming
BTS He ate his share of meat as rapidly as he could
BTS 3 boat and Johnson and Leach were missing
BTS Not that he is much to speak of now Wolf Larsen went on but he has improved wonderfully
BTS Salary or piece-work
BTS A wolf is a wolf
BTS Water was not alive
BTS Van Weyden
BTS They talked in large ways of policy and they identified policy and right
BTS If Jesus was right then these two unfortunates were my sisters and the only hope of their purification was in my affection and tenderness
BTS The life that was so swiftly expanding within him urged him continually toward the wall of light
BTS And the pathos of it and the tragedy is that they are tied by their heartstrings
BTS Hello on deck I replied
BTS My body struck and pounded as it was dashed helplessly along and turned over and over and when I could hold my breath no longer I breathed the stinging salt water into my lungs
BTS I never thought of it in that way before
BTS Or if some of the other secret-service comrades who have learned the truth can get there in time
BTS At such moments he charged Buck who retreated craftily luring him on by a simulated inability to escape
BTS But with every mishap he was learning
BTS I looked down at the brown glory of her hair glinting gems in the sunshine far more precious to me than those in the treasure-chests of kings
BTS Look
BTS He walked to the door of his room saying And now Mr
BTS He was appalled
BTS yet it was a greater delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces
BTS Could this then be the firm-poised Christ-like man I had known with pure limpid eyes and a gaze steady and unfaltering as his soul
BTS And to his ears came sounds of the strange god's movements
BTS Then you'll welter in your gore was his retort
BTS And even he could not repress a start and an involuntary bristling of hair along his back when she suddenly leaped without warning straight up in the air at the same time emitting a long and most terrible squall
BTS Perhaps also it was the elemental simplicity of his mind that baffled me
BTS The general strike was a warning
BTS I stood still in trepidation
BTS Ah but it is cowardly cowardly
BTS They did not know how to do anything and as the days went by it became apparent that they could not learn
BTS Famine came again and the cub with clearer consciousness knew once more the bite of hunger
BTS Dumb apathy had vanished
BTS And so ended the night with the Philomaths
BTS Power you have proclaimed the king of words
BTS I am more than brave
BTS The hunting for us was spoiled
BTS she next asked
BTS Again when he was weak it was his luck that none of the larger preying animals chanced upon him
BTS Another man's life I mean
BTS But White Fang soon learned to differentiate between thieves and honest men to appraise the true value of step and carriage
BTS His calculation of the membership of these divisions by occupation from the United States Census of 1900 is as follows Plutocratic class 250251
BTS and you know that in the end they will destroy you take away from you the last per cent of your little profits
BTS and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission man man who is the most restless of life ever in revolt against the dictum that all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement
BTS I'm all right
BTS he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot and finally he was deposited in an express car
BTS But these too soon ceased and a semi-silence settled down broken by groans and sobs and sounds of strangulation
BTS The Second Revolt was largely the work of Ernest Everhard though he cooperated of course with the European leaders
BTS I wish it weren't so late I said
BTS These we learned afterward as for example the secret messages of the oligarchs sent with the express purpose of leaking to the ears of the revolutionists that had come over the wires now and again during the first part of the night
BTS What could he say
BTS The snow walls pressed him on every side and a great surge of fear swept through him the fear of the wild thing for the trap
BTS This man good at heart but with a ferocious animalism close at the surface of his being lying in jail and expectant of nothing less than death was prevailed upon by the agents of the Iron Heel to throw the bomb in the House of Representatives
BTS Childish and immaterial as the topic was the quality of their reasoning was still more childish and immaterial
BTS A bell-buoy and we're a-top of it
BTS He opened his pocket-book and counted out the bills
BTS She was pretty and soft but she weighed one hundred and twenty pounds a lusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and starving animals
BTS She had snarled as she sprang away baring her white fangs to their roots all her wistfulness vanishing being replaced by a carnivorous malignity that made him shudder
BTS The god merely held near to his nose a piece of meat
BTS They were truly lords of society
BTS The more he came to know them the more they vindicated their superiority the more they displayed their mysterious powers the greater loomed their god-likeness
BTS For he steals my bread and meat and bed and in so doing imperils my life
BTS Yet you say I was made well
BTS I was never sick in my life
BTS No one answered for a long time
BTS Sick 'm Cherokee
BTS Its noise and outcry warned him of its presence while he ran alone velvet-footed silently a moving shadow among the trees after the manner of his father and mother before him
BTS Then he stooped picked it up himself and with two strokes cut Buck's traces
BTS Not one succeeded in laying a hand on him and it was well that they did not
BTS two at Ardis and one at Asgard
BTS while no man not a member of the favored unions was permitted to carry weapons
BTS But you competed among yourselves
BTS Also a great pulse was beating in my brain
BTS The figures have been gathered and it has been proved conclusively that accidents rarely occur in the first hours of the morning work but that they increase rapidly in the succeeding hours as the workers grow tired and slower in both their muscular and mental processes
BTS But he returned more fixed than ever in his determination to preach the message of the Church
BTS Henry acknowledged receipt of the information with a grunt that slid into a snore as he drifted back into sleep
BTS Van Weyden'
BTS But to return to Peter Donnelly and his son
BTS That for your immature generalizations and childish reasonings
BTS Like most creatures of the Wild he early experienced famine
BTS Of course this was because I did not concern myself with charity
BTS I suspect him
BTS While he yelped and ki-yi'd and scrambled backward he saw the mother-weasel leap upon her young one and disappear with it into the neighbouring thicket
BTS And he felt shame that the man-animals should be laughing at him
BTS When Biedenbach the German terrorist hid with us some time later he installed a smoke-consuming device that enabled us to sit by crackling wood fires on winter nights
BTS Oofty-Oofty laid hold of Parsons's thumb pulling it out stoutly and snapping it back into place
BTS Another day a full-grown wolf fresh-caught from the Wild was shoved in through the door of the pen
BTS More I heard of him afterward
BTS But I have read the personal narratives of a score of shipwrecked men who tried and tried in vain I answered
BTS her unrest came back upon her and she knew again her pressing need to find the thing for which she searched
BTS It was a face that rarely displayed colour but to-night it was flushed and vivacious

BTS And you have shown me I was right
BTS Thornton rose to his feet
BTS I breathed
BTS You sell a great deal at cut-rates
BTS A poor substitute for food was this hide just as it had been stripped from the starved horses of the cattlemen six months back
BTS but the Cockney was desperately melancholy and I was aware of a great sympathy for the unfortunate creature
BTS The insidious revolt led by Buck had destroyed the solidarity of the team
BTS Scott give the poor devil a fightin' chance
BTS He found it expedient to be cautious all the time except for the rare moments when assured of his own intrepidity he abandoned himself to petty rages and lusts
BTS The Irishman wavered
BTS Night began to fall and to make matters worse the wind sprang up ahead
BTS This was a surprise to many of the revolutionists
BTS Yes sir killed 'im dead-oh
BTS Primitive man was a combinative beast and because of it he rose to primacy over all the animals
BTS He was a ferocious man
BTS He fascinated me immeasurably and I feared him immeasurably
BTS And that great humanist Abraham Lincoln said just before his assassination I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country
BTS He looked at me and his eyes twinkled
BTS You'll get used to such things in time
BTS And I I said quickly
BTS His spirit was too gentle
BTS You are no longer the biggest bit of the ferment
BTS The shrill little whistle like the chirping of a cricket amid the cries of great beasts shot through the fog from more to the side and swiftly grew faint and fainter
BTS I looked about me at their faces and saw that they remained complacently superior to what he had charged
BTS '  Our Benevolent Feudalism a book published in 1902 A
BTS he asked
BTS When they affirmed that they knew the working class he told them fundamental truths about the working class that they did not know and challenged them for disproofs
BTS There is a large likelihood of internal injuries
BTS Remained only the trampled snow to show how closely they had pressed him
BTS It is only nervousness she answered
BTS he would proclaim triumphantly when he had brought one of them a cropper
BTS I'm doing it now
BTS After that as I saw that he had not maligned my class and that the harsh and bitter things he said about it were justified I had drawn closer to him again
BTS But to die this way
BTS The bad stands for all things that are fraught with discomfort menace and hurt and is hated accordingly
BTS Our strength the strength of the proletariat is in our muscles in our hands to cast ballots in our fingers to pull triggers

BTS Furthermore we charge that the Iron Heel was guilty of the outrage and that the Iron Heel planned and perpetrated the outrage for the purpose of foisting the guilt on our shoulders and so bringing about our destruction
BTS Ernest demanded
BTS Scott could only look in wonder
BTS My brain grew clearer and I turned as I ran and looked at the man who was holding me up
BTS I feel it
BTS Something was happening
BTS he had so loved the Ghost and delighted in her sailing powers
BTS I exclaimed
BTS And this also was a law of the gods
BTS He essayed another circle
BTS D'you remember Dallas the superintendent
BTS I could hear him crying
BTS So you know how to play Nap' Wolf Larsen was saying in a pleased sort of voice
BTS It did not seem possible that any living creature could thus beard Wolf Larsen in his teeth
BTS But Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness imagination
BTS He made it clear to Buck that he was to come and they ran side by side through the sombre twilight straight up the creek bed into the gorge from which it issued and across the bleak divide where it took its rise
BTS As he rounded the house to the porte-cochere he came upon the carriage
BTS I have spoken
BTS I came back and went on with my work
BTS Who am I to complain
BTS As the days went by the evolution of like into love was accelerated
BTS And we all of us will make new and more wonderful machines
BTS As it passed Wolf Larsen began to speak the bare-headed men swaying in unison to the heave and lunge of the deck
BTS It would do immense good
BTS The sled itself was without runners being a birch-bark toboggan with upturned forward end to keep it from ploughing under the snow
BTS But when the love-master spoke White Fang came to him with prompt obedience
BTS And in so far as the Church does not protest it condones for remember the Church is supported by the capitalist class
BTS 2
BTS I crept softly up the companion-way and peeped at him
BTS I did not expect to find any one here
BTS A chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder
BTS With the newcomers hopeless and forlorn and the old team worn out by twenty-five hundred miles of continuous trail the outlook was anything but bright
BTS I shall not take any risks I said
BTS He was a good runner swifter than any puppy of his size and swifter than Lip-lip
BTS The man addressed as Yonson a man of the heavy Scandinavian type ceased chafing me and arose awkwardly to his feet
BTS Well stranger the other drawled irritatingly I don't mind telling you that's something I ain't worked out for myself
BTS The two men were bent over the sled and trying to right it when Henry observed One Ear sidling away
BTS The first blow was aimed at these special editions and it was a crushing one
BTS And still remains the balance
BTS She looked at me and I looked inquiry back
BTS but many a young dog went around camp with a lacerated throat in token of White Fang's intention
BTS We worked in silence
BTS It was my turn to be cheerful and I played the part to the best of my ability and with such success that I brought the laughter back into her dear eyes and song on her lips
BTS demanded those who had been really asleep and who had wakened to they knew not what
BTS But of course it is out of the question that Johnson should thrash Wolf Larsen
BTS It was a simple matter to give the dogs less food
BTS Then came his disillusionment and this disillusionment he described in terms that did not flatter his audience
BTS I was desperate
BTS The hair bristled upon the grey cub's back but it bristled silently
BTS Eh Kerfoot
BTS Matt regarded his employer with grieved disapproval
BTS In fact I remember the placid exaltation with which I took up my position on the forward upper deck directly beneath the pilot-house and allowed the mystery of the fog to lay hold of my imagination
BTS The master rubbed his ears and he crooned his love-growl
BTS At the office he had only professional feelings
BTS Your socialistic dream is
BTS The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and Buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless
BTS In the nature of things and of intercourse with gods something terrible awaited him
BTS First time I ever heard you say anything about their not bein' wise
BTS The wolf was suspicious and afraid
BTS In this village after the custom of all dogs in all villages White Fang went foraging for food
BTS ' He preferred the vanity and vexation to the silence and unmovableness of the grave
BTS Once off his feet and under that mass of huskies there was no hope for him
BTS Then he rolled over on his side with a heavy sobbing sigh saying A sixpence is a tanner and a shilling a bob
BTS As you say you do not understand Ernest replied
BTS Thornton came to belly downward and being violently propelled back and forth across a drift log by Hans and Pete
BTS Of course at first much was mere blundering experiment
BTS Step by step before the advance of science they have been driven back
BTS It was too revolting
BTS This was the mouth of the cave and the source of light
BTS Twist it an' you'll choke 'm plentee said Manuel and the stranger grunted a ready affirmative
BTS Wolf Larsen was watching him waiting for him the steely glitter in his eyes
BTS Procuring their rifles they opened fire in a leisurely manner upon the deserters
BTS He began in a low voice haltingly and modestly and with an air of evident embarrassment
BTS It is the wind that fans the desire until it leaps up to mastery
BTS Not more impatiently do I await the flame of to-morrow's revolt than did I that night await the coming of Ernest
BTS It is sold abroad Mr
BTS So befuddled and chaotic were their minds that the utterance of a single word could negative the generalizations of a lifetime of serious research and thought
BTS Ain't the slightest doubt in the world was Henry's response
BTS but golden his eyes were enticing and masterful at the same time luring and compelling and speaking a demand and clamour of the blood which no woman much less Maud Brewster could misunderstand
BTS His attitude was of one looking forward the length of the schooner or staring rather for his eyes were fixed and unblinking
BTS The shark dropped back into the sea helpless yet with its full strength doomed to lingering starvation a living death less meet for it than for the man who devised the punishment
BTS It was a fateful day for the Yeehats
BTS There was driftwood though not much on the beach and the sight of a coffee tin I had taken from the Ghost's larder had given me the idea of a fire
BTS The next moment the front of the column went by
BTS I was close upon him my knife uplifted but I withheld the blow
BTS What I am striving to express is this strength itself more as a thing apart from his physical semblance
BTS Everywhere with the exception of two or three countries the erstwhile capitalist masters fought bitterly for their possessions
BTS In ways subtler than they knew they betrayed their intentions to the wolf-dog that haunted the cabin-stoop and that though he never came inside the cabin knew what went on inside their brains
BTS But you read him misunderstandingly when you conclude that the struggle for existence sanctions your wanton destruction of life
BTS The Canadian and Mexican patriots who were far stronger than the Iron Heel dreamed were to duplicate our tactics
BTS After the beating White Fang was dragged back to the fort
BTS I talked with Johnson and Leach during the night watches when Wolf Larsen was below
BTS I became restless and anxious and when Thomas Mugridge glared down the companion-way sick and angry of countenance I prepared to go about my duties
BTS I asked resting my hand on his shoulder
BTS For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank and during those two days and nights of torment he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him
BTS John Thornton was whittling the last touches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch
BTS and when they had put it on the back and covered it over with a couple of other bundles she discovered overlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very sack and they unloaded again
BTS When he saw or heard her coming he got up and walked off
BTS As we clung to the lee rail and worked our way aft I happened to glance to leeward
BTS When you squeezed out the three small groceries here in Berkeley by virtue of your superior combination you swelled out your chest talked about efficiency and enterprise and sent your wife to Europe on the profits you had gained by eating up the three small groceries
BTS Tell me where you live and I shall call later he said when he saw that I walked beside him and that it was my intention to stick to him now that he was found
BTS The porcupine might unroll
BTS I strove to compel myself to think we would make the landing safely and so I spoke not what I believed but what I preferred to believe
BTS Congress and the Senate were empty pretences farces
BTS What is it
BTS As he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the land
BTS You speak so calmly  she began
BTS The numbness is growing
BTS And I am very happy only
BTS And suiting the action to the words he closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair
BTS Then I noticed the twinkle in his eyes
BTS Help me into my bunk
BTS While old One Eye the wolf crouching in the covert played his part too in the game waiting for some strange freak of Chance that might help him on the meat-trail which was his way of life
BTS As the man's hand approached his neck White Fang bristled and snarled and crouched down
BTS He fell into it
BTS Matt bent over and passed his hand along White Fang's belly
BTS And man has been achieving greater and greater combinations ever since
BTS As for the rest the wages of those who were loyal were unceasing peril torture and death
BTS And yet I am wrong
BTS There was never any telling what might happen for with live things events were somehow always happening differently
BTS My
BTS But unlike Pervaise the confession of Romaines was made public in his own time
BTS he called softly
BTS I felt relief at least as far as the two men were concerned
BTS A hundred yards below the hole the stream ran out into open country joining the main stream and flowing across rolling and grass-covered land
BTS He seemed to recover himself for a lucid gleam came into his eyes and he relaxed his hold with a short laugh that was more like a growl
BTS She rendered it beautifully but I watched not her but Wolf Larsen
BTS I was no longer Humphrey Van Weyden
BTS Yes
BTS After that he will be left to gibber his visions to padded walls
BTS and he answered curse with snarl and kept out of their reach
BTS But I said
BTS So often did this happen that it became the custom to hold White Fang until the other dog went through its preliminaries was good and ready and even made the first attack
BTS My memory of what happened in the succeeding hours is the memory one would have of nightmare
BTS And there were easements and satisfactions
BTS The proud Chicago proletariat lived up to its ancient boast
BTS He had to learn that he must not touch the chickens that belonged to other gods
BTS Sometimes he thought of Judge Miller's big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley and of the cement swimming-tank and Ysabel the Mexican hairless and Toots the Japanese pug
BTS Bishop Morehouse turned appealingly to my father but he laughed and nodded his head
BTS He was thrilling and exulting in ways new to him and greater to him than any he had known before
BTS This was Spitz's opportunity
BTS All my old-time marvel at life returned to me at sight of this splendid incarnation of it and Wolf Larsen's cold explanation of life and its meaning was truly ridiculous and laughable
BTS It is coming now
BTS I was once Peter Donnelly the scab foreman
BTS At such times he whimpered and snarled in his sleep and they that looked on said that his dreams were bad
BTS The very thing Ernest agreed
BTS Here is a man who works on the street railways
BTS He seized me and threw me down
BTS Go to them old fellow
BTS He would advance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching movement when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for a few more inches
BTS In spite of himself and all the pricking warnings of his instinct White Fang began to have confidence in this god
BTS Five or six miles from the lair the stream divided its forks going off among the mountains at a right angle
BTS It was very simple
BTS indigestion I retorted and continued my walk as if nothing untoward had occurred
BTS And now the call came to Buck in unmistakable accents
BTS Undoubtedly he was some emissary of the Iron Heel but he has escaped detection
BTS Maud stood silently by my side while I evolved in my mind the contrivance known among sailors as shears
BTS He's not black-hearted like some men
BTS And when in addition to this the worn-out huskies pulled weakly Hal decided that the orthodox ration was too small
BTS White Fang remained on the Yukon the property of a man more than half mad and all brute
BTS The wolves were now in the country of game and though they still hunted in pack they hunted more cautiously cutting out heavy cows or crippled old bulls from the small moose-herds they ran across
BTS Slipping off a turn I lowered the mast back into the water and fastened the tackle a third of the way down from the butt
BTS The muscles refused their duty
BTS Mr
BTS And what are you going to do about it
BTS She put her hand sympathetically on mine and said You will have to begin over again
BTS Of me--in an asylum for the insane
BTS In the third year of his life there came a great famine to the Mackenzie Indians
BTS The close-reefed foresail worked
BTS Then there were meals to be cooked in the galley beds to make Wolf Larsen to be attended upon and she finished the day with a grand house-cleaning attack upon the cabin and steerage
BTS Go ahead and cut I threatened ominously
BTS Not that the outcome would have been different however
BTS To my delight she never once looked toward the beach and I maintained the banter with such success all unconsciously she sipped coffee from the china cup ate fried evaporated potatoes and spread marmalade on her biscuit
BTS The last place in the world the spies of the Iron Heel would dream of looking for me and for Ernest when he joined me was Wickson's deer-park
BTS Surely not
BTS In fact he seemed as much at home among the trees as on the ground
BTS The condition of the people of the abyss was pitiable
BTS Their feet fell heavily on the trail jarring their bodies and doubling the fatigue of a day's travel
BTS my father asked and I could see that it was likewise new to him
BTS He was a strange animal an intruder
BTS It was in Germany
BTS Don't you see
BTS It took them half the night to pitch a slovenly camp and half the morning to break that camp and get the sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day they were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load
BTS It was the quality that was peculiarly the possession of his kind
BTS More of this white stuff was falling through the air
BTS A stranger could not hear this note and to such a stranger the growling of White Fang was an exhibition of primordial savagery nerve-racking and blood-curdling
BTS But White Fang's reprisals did not cease even when the young dogs had learned thoroughly that they must stay together
BTS Your desire for profits which is sheer selfishness you metamorphose into altruistic solicitude for suffering humanity
BTS The expropriated farmers took forcible possession of the state governments
BTS Like the smile the shrug was twisted
BTS Of her own experience she had no memory of the thing happening
BTS I felt an elation of spirit
BTS The qualities in his kind that in the beginning made it possible for them to come in to the fires of men were qualities capable of development
BTS Johansen
BTS He still retained sufficient use of his left arm to do this
BTS He was the spirit of regnant labor as he stood there his hands outreaching to rend and crush his audience
BTS And so it was with White Fang
BTS A spasm of fear went through him
BTS I crept back to my horse blankets and slept again
BTS It had been peaceful in its occurrence sacred in its ceremonial
BTS He too made a low flight but he was in luck for they failed seriously to puncture his balloon
BTS Were he not so terrible a man I could sometimes feel sorry for him as instance three mornings ago when I went into his stateroom to fill his water-bottle and came unexpectedly upon him
BTS My body was stiff from exertion as well as from cold and my aching muscles gave me the severest torture whenever I used them and I used them continually
BTS Each day grows perceptibly warmer
BTS with the Judge's grandsons a sort of pompous guardianship
BTS It is no slight matter for two men particularly when a stiff wind has sprung up to handle a vessel like the Ghost steering keeping look-out for the boats and setting or taking in sail
BTS The words were the last I ever heard him utter
BTS He knew his two brothers and his two sisters very well
BTS Ah it's myself that knows ye for a blitherin' fool
BTS I took a fresh hold on my bedclothes and was preparing to start on when some movement caught my eye and I looked astern to the rail
BTS But his eyes did light upon me and looked squarely into mine
BTS At least half of their enthusiasm to-day was due to that
BTS They were camped near the log store where she in her friendly way made advances to a husky dog the size of a full-grown wolf though not half so large as she
BTS the establishment of our secret printing-presses
BTS And what you have won is mine sir I said boldly
BTS He made me see things in new ways and I became a socialist
BTS The law was a puppet with which he played
BTS He almost fell backward and swayed from side to side in an effort to recover his balance
BTS Galvin shook his head
BTS Yet he possessed his soul with patience and during this time of his torment when Hadly who had been brought for the purpose from Illinois made him over into another man he revolved great plans in his head for the organization of the learned proletariat and for the maintenance of at least the rudiments of education amongst the people of the abyss--all this of course in the event of the First Revolt being a failure
BTS There was a great uproar
BTS For that matter look at you and me
BTS as it was he merely missed the snow in a vague subconscious way
BTS Mugridge with a sharp howl of pain humbly begged everybody's pardon
BTS There they became outlaws and it was not until more peaceful times that they received their punishment
BTS We let down the bars and crossed an upland meadow
BTS CHAPTER IV THE TRAIL OF THE GODS In the fall of the year when the days were shortening and the bite of the frost was coming into the air White Fang got his chance for liberty
BTS As there were nine boats all told it meant that we should have plenty of water and ballast as well though there was the chance that the boat would be overloaded what of the generous supply of other things I was taking
BTS I was indeed clumsy in those days
BTS The best sailorman in the fo'c'sle
BTS The vessel seemed to go off at a tangent to its former course and leapt almost instantly from view into the fog
BTS He took the precaution to sheer off from the two watching gods and walked carefully to the corner of the cabin
BTS I forget my own life in the love of another life
BTS God must be angry
BTS There was Owen of Silverberg Owen  Company--a large grocery firm with several branch stores
BTS It was Smoke's unmistakable voice crying from the masthead
BTS You can prove anything by metaphysics
BTS This rush was never completed
BTS He had been brow-beaten and confused by Colonel Ingram
BTS White Fang bristled but waited
BTS but his eyes had never had to adjust themselves to any other light
BTS At supper I requested the hunters to lower their voices so she was not disturbed
BTS Wrong Bill proclaimed triumphantly
BTS And you won't lose I agreed
BTS In vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down
BTS This in itself was a masterstroke
BTS Maud asked
BTS But as he lay there suddenly there came to him a feeling as of something terrible impending
BTS To live
BTS I know only that I am capable of doing anything these days
BTS She's close she's close
BTS It was the case of General Lampton that revived crucifixion as a legal method of execution
BTS In such industrial hells arose some of the proudest fortunes of that day
BTS The dog-musher let go of him precipitately with action similar to that of a man who has picked up live fire
BTS Fresh from his revolutionists he was shocked by the intellectual stupidity of the master class
BTS He gave them a bigger lay
BTS The awe of man rushed over him again
BTS You are the slave to the opinions which have credence among the people you have known and have read about
BTS On the other hand possibly because he divined in Buck a dangerous rival Spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth
BTS The Toil of Trace and Trail Thirty days from the time it left Dawson the Salt Water Mail with Buck and his mates at the fore arrived at Skaguay
BTS Also it looked as solid as the earth but was without any solidity at all
BTS also he saw a woman
BTS In the eighteenth century in England men and women wove cloth on hand-looms in their own cottages
BTS for I knew that she must attend him and I wished to save her as much as possible
BTS There could be but one result and that was that his ferocity fed upon itself and increased
BTS I could not take my eyes from him
BTS We'll make them work and trust our lives to them
BTS It was a starlight night and I could see the bulk of him dimly as he moved about
BTS It did not take long
BTS I'll be case-hardened by that time was his reply
BTS I'm a-thinkin' that was the one I lambasted with the club
BTS It was like learning a new language say the French
BTS She buried her head on my shoulder her frail form shaken with a storm of weeping
BTS Where was Ernest
BTS She was agreed that the most rigorous treatment was necessary if we were to escape though she recoiled at the suggestion that I might some time be compelled to take his life to save my own our own she put it
BTS Concerted action was impossible in face of the heavy arsenal of weapons carried in the steerage and cabin
BTS Had Dick had his way they would have been good friends
BTS Have you ever asked what will happen to you when greater combinations than even the present trusts arise
BTS Conversation ceased
BTS Shut the doors and draw the slide Wolf Larsen said to me
BTS Yes he will have some beef-tea she said quietly looking up at me
BTS Frankly he has one chance in a thousand announced the surgeon after he had worked an hour and a half on White Fang
BTS And yet we are supposed to get justice by means of the law
BTS A blow from Three Eagles knocked him backward to the land
BTS His head dropped forward on the table and was buried in his hands
BTS The Oligarchy stood in the way
BTS And they will succeed
BTS He interrupted again and again with comment and criticism
BTS What if I forbid you
BTS From his St
BTS In the meantime the love-master was patting White Fang and talking to him
BTS Johansen call all hands
BTS but I felt a sinking at the heart and seemed to divine the presence of bleached bones somewhere on that beach
BTS and so greatly did hunger compel him he was not above taking what did not belong to him
BTS There was a burgeoning within him of strange feelings and unwonted impulses
BTS in 1908 1108427
BTS I saw a head the hair wet and straight shape itself and then the unmistakable eyes and face of Wolf Larsen
BTS It must have been latent savagery stirring in me for the old words so bound up with the roots of the race to grip me and thrill me
BTS The carriage had driven away and other strange gods had appeared from out the house
BTS Not a word that he uttered will see print
BTS He quickly came to know much of the ways of the man-animals but familiarity did not breed contempt
BTS nor do I wish ever to see him in a genuine rage when all the force of him is called into play
BTS The cub experienced another access of affection on the part of his mother
BTS And truly the religious revival assumed formidable proportions
BTS Wants all he can get--true but deplorable
BTS But how did I know she was fancy free
BTS No caress of theirs could put the love-croon into his throat and try as they would they could never persuade him into snuggling against them
BTS Too late
BTS It restrained him opposed the will of him toward personal liberty
BTS But life and death were in that glance
BTS I must see him as soon as I am dressed
BTS They constituted the balance of power in the struggles between the labor castes and the oligarchs and now to one side and now to the other threw their strength according to the play of intrigue and conspiracy
BTS We are not responsible for it
BTS Yes
BTS and men mere motes of light and sparkle cursed with an insane relish for work riding their steeds of wood and steel through the heart of the mystery groping their way blindly through the Unseen and clamouring and clanging in confident speech the while their hearts are heavy with incertitude and fear
BTS The tackles jammed
BTS no effort of will can possibly induce disbelief in such a god
BTS Colonel Ingram is a great lawyer
BTS Wot 're you good for anyw'y I'd like to know
BTS The village had gone away
BTS Among themselves a primitive barter began to spring up
BTS The boat could not live
BTS But as I studied the surf which beat upon the beach I said Still bad but not so bad
BTS Bill had already gone from sight
BTS They were all about him and the fire in a narrow circle and he could see them plainly in the firelight lying down sitting up crawling forward on their bellies or slinking back and forth
BTS He did not propose
BTS I felt humble and contrite and was aware of a sweet feeling that Ernest was a sort of father confessor
BTS Beyond a sailor at the wheel who stared curiously across the top of the cabin I attracted no notice whatever
BTS Ernest laughed harshly and savagely when he had gained the street
BTS They'd never iv made the land sir I'm thinkin'
BTS There was nothing to do nothing to see nor hear
BTS He was famed as a wit but he had no wit now
BTS I'm already myde an' myde out of leavin's an' scraps
BTS On the other hand being a sheep-dog her instinctive fear of the Wild and especially of the wolf was unusually keen
BTS But almost as quickly as it had arisen the commotion died away
BTS In the morning it was Henry who awoke first and routed his companion out of bed
BTS This made hard times for the men
BTS You've long years before you and you can make anything you please of yourself
BTS It was impossible impossible
BTS All right Beauty Smith spoke up with the alacrity of fear
BTS Yes and I've had warnings of this for the last three days
BTS Its reasoning method is the same as that of any particular science and of all particular sciences
BTS I asked
BTS Don't you see
BTS The fine hand of the Iron Heel was apparent in every column
BTS Two billions are left to capital
BTS Ernest had his hand on the pulse of events even more closely than the rest of the socialists and within two days the first blow was struck
BTS the stout gentleman who had been reading my essay encased in cork and canvas the magazine still in his hand and asking me with monotonous insistence if I thought there was any danger
BTS You ketch um dog were Beauty Smith's words to Grey Beaver
BTS Never shall I forget the night when after a hot discussion with half a dozen labor leaders Ernest turned to me and said quietly That settles it
BTS The hands of society are harsh and this man was a striking sample of its handiwork
BTS As he leaned there he ran a calm and speculative eye over us as though to determine the precise point of the collision and took no notice whatever when our pilot white with rage shouted Now you've done it
BTS He bellied cautiously inside and was met by a warning snarl from the she-wolf
BTS You live on an income which your father earned
BTS He was warm-blooded passionate emotional
BTS Ernest and his fellows knew that their effort was futile but they were tired of the suspense
BTS The Church does not know
BTS They bristled up to him stiff-legged and challenging while he wasting no time on elaborate preliminaries snapping into action like a steel spring was at their throats and destroying them before they knew what was happening and while they were yet in the throes of surprise
BTS Because of the two prior convictions against him Judge Scott imposed upon him a sentence of fifty years
BTS They were known as chechaquos and they always wilted at the application of the name
BTS life swelled through his veins in full and magnificent flood
BTS The country was on the verge of hard times caused by a series of prosperous years wherein the difficulty of disposing abroad of the unconsumed surplus had become increasingly difficult
BTS Guess he don't hear us yet
BTS As I scrambled out on all fours I passed over the body of Thomas Mugridge who lay in a groaning heap
BTS Prevented from obtaining his share of meat and fish when a general feed was given to the camp-dogs he became a clever thief
BTS So did I go for'ard
BTS The Wolf is not yet dead I muttered to myself as I sprang down through the smoke
BTS Bernard father he had inherited size and weight but it was his shepherd mother who had given shape to that size and weight
BTS White Fang did not run away though he was allowed to remain loose because he liked this new god
BTS It had been ripped almost in half and was still bleeding profusely
BTS The elder Scott looked incredulously first at White Fang then at Dick and finally at his son
BTS Here I am I answered stepping to his side
BTS If nothing else I was escaping from the organized ostracism that had been our increasing portion in the university town ever since the enmity of the nascent Oligarchy had been incurred
BTS I felt again the pulse of his palm on mine the touch of his lips
BTS He grumbles out when things don't go to suit him and there'll be always some tell-tale carryin' word iv it aft to the Wolf
BTS Morning came but for the first time the light of day failed to scatter the wolves
BTS He opened his eyes and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnapped king
BTS There were other run-ways and alleys where rabbits were hanging in the air and the wolf-pair prospected them all the she-wolf leading the way old One Eye following and observant learning the method of robbing snares a knowledge destined to stand him in good stead in the days to come
BTS In retaliation the survivors meted out to Donnelly the death he had earned by his treason
BTS Her lines and fittings though I know nothing about such things speak for themselves
BTS I could see he was working rapidly with his hands
BTS Behind what he said were the same nameless formless things that I feel
BTS All day Buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp
BTS Why you are chilled through
BTS Not but that I was afloat in a safe craft for the Martinez was a new ferry-steamer making her fourth or fifth trip on the run between Sausalito and San Francisco
BTS But the god talked on softly and ever the hand rose and fell with non-hostile pats
BTS One arm was under his head the other lay on top of the blankets
BTS I felt quite amused at his unwarranted choler and while he stumped indignantly up and down I fell to dwelling upon the romance of the fog
BTS At the end of an hour and a half he was nearly alongside standing past our stern on the last leg out aiming to fetch us on the next leg back
BTS By the power of our ballots on election day will we take your government away from you-- What if you do get a majority a sweeping majority on election day
BTS As a rule Perrault travelled ahead of the team packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them
BTS I don't know myself
BTS He was a man and a monstrosity as fearful a thing of fear as ever gibbered in the visions of a maddened brain
BTS She ceased talking and nodding her head went on stitching
BTS I could not feel the full force of the wind for we were running with it
BTS The cubs slept while the life that was in them flickered and died down
BTS But the god talked on interminably
BTS Buck wondered where they went for they never came back
BTS For he had already learned that there were such restrictions
BTS Take heed gentlemen of the war and navy departments
BTS Yet the food you have eaten or wasted might have saved the lives of a score of wretches who made the food but did not eat it
BTS Then in desperation I abandoned the attempt to reef the mainsail and resolved to try the experiment of heaving to under the close-reefed foresail
BTS No need to be I gulped
BTS The man you drove from Eden's grove Was I my Lord was I And I shall be there when the earth and the air Are rent from sea to sky
BTS He was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed and prodded till he cried out many times
BTS I cried in a husky voice I did not recognize as my own
BTS The whips snapped the bells tinkled merrily the sleds churned along the trail
BTS On the other hand try as they would they could not kill White Fang
BTS Never had I imagined so great a sea
BTS One of our secret agents was a member of the 'Frisco Reds
BTS Also it seemed to him that the fort was besieged by wolves
BTS He would often seize Thornton's hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward
BTS We lay scarcely rolling on the placid sea unable to follow
BTS If modern man's producing power is a thousand times greater than that of the cave-man why then in the United States to-day are there fifteen million people who are not properly sheltered and properly fed
BTS Then he added Still well but not so well that argument of yours
BTS that the international organization of the socialists finally formulated their long-maturing policy on war
BTS This time I remained aloft and Wolf Larsen succeeded in heaving to without being swept
BTS Not so was the conduct of Leach
BTS But they displayed little difference from the wolf when they discovered the cub and his mother
BTS It is the tradition that he died of starvation in solitary confinement and this harsh treatment is explained as having been caused by his uncompromising stubbornness and his fiery and tactless hatred for all men that served the despotism
BTS She was getting very heavy and could run but slowly
BTS Beauty Smith entered club in hand and took the chain off from White Fang's neck
BTS But beyond warning coughs from either side there were no signs of hostility
BTS Bill asked anxiously
BTS The oligarchs did not dare permit the telling of the whole truth
BTS Our interests became mutual and we worked together and played together
BTS but his mouth was wide open his breast heaving as though from suffocation as he laboured noisily for breath
BTS This instead of being a danger was an added security
BTS the driver asked
BTS The things not alive remained always in one place but the live things moved about and there was no telling what they might do
BTS In the coal- mining regions the employment of children was notorious
BTS You have had enough of hardship
BTS No fair play
BTS I could not be so fortunate
BTS You can go to hell sir
BTS The deep-sea voices of these men rumbling and bellowing in the confined space produced a wild effect
BTS Though his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal he was too wise to rebel
BTS For going down into the cabin to turn in I decided that it was too stuffy to sleep below
BTS So as twilight deepened gladly and at the same time reluctantly I brought the Ghost up on the wind
BTS To say nothing of three bullet holes clear through him
BTS Every rope was brought to a ring at the front end of the sled
BTS Here are you a century and a half later trying to break machines
BTS But not quite
BTS He was surprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was communicated to him
BTS They were of the same large type as Thornton living close to the earth thinking simply and seeing clearly
BTS The day had been long and arduous and he slept soundly and comfortably though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams
BTS Just now the possession of this money is a pleasurable thing
BTS Perhaps they were the last he did utter too
BTS You run ahead too fast O'Connor answered
BTS I breathed more freely
BTS Every part brain and body nerve tissue and fibre was keyed to the most exquisite pitch
BTS While on the question of vagaries I shall tell what befell Thomas Mugridge in the cabin and at the same time complete an incident upon which I have already touched once or twice
BTS And still the Ghost foamed along racing off the miles till I was certain she was making at least eleven knots
BTS But if we are immortal what is the reason for this
BTS I confess that I delighted in this beating Leach was giving to Thomas Mugridge though it was as terrible almost as the one Mugridge had caused to be given to Johnson
BTS The Cockney strove in vain to protect himself from the infuriated boy
BTS At first the killing of the white men's dogs had been a diversion
BTS I'll tell you Ernest continued
BTS In the winter the cariboo forsook their accustomed track
BTS he cried
BTS When the master appeared all other beings ceased to exist so far as White Fang was concerned
BTS Gad sir
BTS He was rarely really angry
BTS Let us see
BTS But it was a weak growl at best and it quickly ceased
BTS I could not allow myself to forget for an instant so automatically imperative had become the new personality I had created
BTS For the first time the German war-lord faced the men of his empire who made his empire go
BTS And there we found a little old German woman--sixty-four years old the Bishop said
BTS Buck multiplied himself attacking from all sides enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace cutting out his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates wearing out the patience of creatures preyed upon which is a lesser patience than that of creatures preying
BTS At the same time Sydney Brooks writing in America in Harper's Weekly said You will not hear the socialists mentioned in Washington
BTS And with the question a great light seemed to fill the place and I saw my duty sun-clear as Saul saw his on the way to Damascus
BTS Never in the history of the world was society in so terrific flux as it is right now
BTS I could hear the water rushing down upon the deck
BTS It was this that made him protest at the commencement of our acquaintance against being called Yonson
BTS The walls and towers and shafts of that fair city will arise to the sound of singing and into its beauty and wonder will be woven not sighs and groans but music and laughter
BTS He sprang away from it and from a distance studied it suspiciously
BTS At once the sapling shot up and after that gave no more trouble remaining in the decorous and perpendicular position in which nature had intended it to grow
BTS So she did not remember White Fang
BTS Maud and I went about our work oppressed by the fearful fate which had overtaken him how fearful we were yet fully to realize
BTS But this was only when the master was not around
BTS Then Wolf Larsen came alone on deck
BTS Tonight he is going to begin putting to rights this very miserable world of ours
BTS Another time he dropped a steel marlinspike from the mizzen crosstree
BTS Free play and plenty of room
BTS He drew him to the fire and by its light pointed them out
BTS This was greeted with whoops of joy and from then on Wolf Larsen had seven strong men on top of him Louis I believe taking no part in it
BTS Lip-lip would not permit it
BTS When the fiat of the Plutocracy went forth they withdrew their advertisements from the Hearst papers
BTS A creature of the Iron Heel he had successfully masqueraded as a revolutionist and penetrated deep into the secrets of our organization
BTS He drew himself inboard with a quick effort and arose to his feet glancing swiftly as he did so at the man at the wheel as though to assure himself of his identity and that there was nothing to fear from him
BTS You have already managed me with your eyes commanded me with them
BTS Do you know I sometimes catch myself wishing that I too were blind to the facts of life and only knew its fancies and illusions
BTS But tell me what became of the owners of the three stores
BTS We ran on to the north and west till we raised the coast of Japan and picked up with the great seal herd
BTS In this way may you look at him through my eyes and learn him as I learned him--in all save the things too secret and sweet for me to tell
BTS 'Ere you come a pore mis'rable specimen of 'uman scum an' I tykes yer into my galley an' treats yer 'ansom an' this is wot I get for it
BTS I might elevate my soul to all kinds of altitudes
BTS The houses of the well-to-do were a combination of safe deposit vault and fortress
BTS It is a true indictment
BTS But when it comes to sociology--my trade--you are down in the dirt at my feet
BTS For several minutes he was to all intents insane
BTS His jaws were apart and through them the tongue protruded draggled and limp
BTS Trap him
BTS And for a moment the thought rose in my mind What if he were overawed by this imposing array of power and brains
BTS she cried
BTS Like Dave he asked nothing gave nothing expected nothing
BTS I rolled off and over to the deck on my back gasping and blinking in the sunshine
BTS But this was denied him
BTS He was jealous of the isolation in which he kept himself in the midst of the pack and he fought often to maintain it
BTS '  Filled with pretty sentiments and an almighty faith in human illusions
BTS CHAPTER XXXIX The day came for our departure
BTS He cried and cried interminably and every fresh wail was greeted by bursts of laughter on the part of the man-animals
BTS It was all so ridiculous that when he got home he had to laugh himself
BTS Once lying awake he heard a strange sound in the white wall
BTS And so well did he face it that at the end of half an hour the wolves drew back discomfited
BTS I didn't want to disappoint her
BTS I was looking up from the galley door and I could see him trembling as if with ague in every limb
BTS Then he went forward again
BTS I do not understand Bishop Morehouse said
BTS And he did it so quickly that the boy did not know either
BTS This was my indictment and I specifically and at length challenged you to answer it
BTS While he was fighting off two or three it was disappearing down the throats of the others
BTS I don't care-- I began indignantly but Ernest interrupted
BTS I have lived in shame and hypocrisies too long to be able to help others
BTS Everything was happening rapidly now
BTS A more scrawny pitiful specimen of humanity one could hardly conceive
BTS You must go through life seeking that flaw and remaining metaphysically silent until you have found it
BTS I beg your pardon I said
BTS He fought from sheer joy finding in it an expression of much that he felt and that otherwise was without speech
BTS Therefore he had disobeyed the will of both the gods and earned the consequent punishment
BTS For what purpose do you think I did it
BTS Matt exclaimed
BTS At least I shall understand a great deal more of life
BTS It piled up in a heap a mound a huge and growing wave of dead and dying
BTS But his fellows grew wise in their own way
BTS but Francois not noticing him brought Sol-leks to the coveted position
BTS That White Fang should quickly gain this post was inevitable
BTS Again the fiat of the Plutocracy went forth and the small business men and manufacturers swamped him with a flood of notices that he must discontinue running their old advertisements
BTS Because Berkeley made an invariable practice of going through doors instead of walls
BTS and he that sweareth as he that feareth an oath
BTS Then there was no movement
BTS Only
BTS At first I covered my eyes with my hands to shut out the awful sight and then in the darkness the question came to me What is to be done
BTS In the time before he was made leader of the team the pack had learned to get out of his way
BTS He knew too well my sympathy for the runaways to send me aloft as look-out
BTS Nor did he like it when the man-animals arose and went on with their march
BTS The first clean bite since I come aboard Harrison said to me at the galley door as he returned the dinner pots and pans from the forecastle
BTS I doubted that she had heard and I resolved to prevent her seeing the brutality I knew would follow the capture of the deserters
BTS White Fang felt fear mounting in him again
BTS Everything was wet except Maud and she in oilskins rubber boots and sou'wester was dry all but her face and hands and a stray wisp of hair
BTS At such moments a great sympathy welled up within me and I felt shame that I had ever joyed in his discomfiture or pain
BTS Heem worth one t'ousan' dollair by Gar
BTS He had led his mother there step by step and now when she stopped he tried to inveigle her farther
BTS Yet submission made him master his fear and he only growled softly
BTS Nor did he stop till he had devoured the whole brood
BTS Why will they not let me alone
BTS He hated all things
BTS Death stalked everywhere and it was only a matter of time when some one of those many huge seas would fall upon the boat roll over it and pass on
BTS Their persecutors were sentenced to long terms in prison where they were harshly treated
BTS I'll relieve Louis at the wheel he said shortly and call upon you to relieve at midnight
BTS Far from it far from it he laughed a moment later
BTS The crisis in my own fortunes came simultaneously with great crises in society
BTS In its frozen state it was more like strips of galvanized iron and when a dog wrestled it into his stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious leathery strings and into a mass of short hair irritating and indigestible
BTS Even Ernest was astounded at the quickness with which it had been done
BTS John C
BTS Four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small high-walled back yard
BTS The feel of him was bad
BTS Just before dinner starting for the beach with an empty barrel they altered their course and bore away to the left to round the promontory which jutted into the sea between them and liberty
BTS I profited by my lesson learned through raising the shears and then climbing them to attach the guys
BTS You bring with you certain fine conceptions of humanity manhood conduct and such things
BTS The socialists were revolutionists he said struggling to overthrow the irrational society of the present and out of the material to build the rational society of the future
BTS Whenever strong proletarians asserted their strength in the midst of the mass they were drawn away from the mass by the oligarchs and given better conditions by being made members of the labor castes or of the Mercenaries
BTS The blessed woman was an unfailing fount of power to me
BTS I remember stumbling at the corner over the legs of a man
BTS I was delighted with the unselfishness and high idealism I encountered though I was appalled by the vast philosophic and scientific literature of socialism that was opened up to me
BTS His quietness under the circumstances was terrible
BTS Why is it that you have not done great things in this world
BTS The parts of him were better adjusted than those of the average dog
BTS They move so does the jelly-fish move
BTS The pain from my hurt knee was agonizing
BTS I had to learn my tools to begin with and every simple mechanical principle which such a man would have at his finger ends I had likewise to learn
BTS You have now become a yardstick yourself
BTS There is a greater strength than wealth and it is greater because it cannot be taken away
BTS A carnivorous animal living on a straight meat diet he was in full flower at the high tide of his life overspilling with vigor and virility
BTS We extended this process to all the countries on the planet till every country was producing every year and every day an unconsumed surplus which it could dispose of to no other country
BTS And human life is in no wise different though you feel it is and think that you reason why it is
BTS When they walked he got out of their way
BTS They were limping and staggering
BTS The men holding the hatch-cover seemed perplexed puzzled no doubt by the briefness of the ceremony
BTS And yet you would break those machines
BTS and Mercedes said Oh
BTS It gives a thrill to life he explained to me when life is carried in one's hand
BTS It seemed like a conjuration
BTS I had heard of such things being made of paper and hollow rushes which quickly became saturated and lost all buoyancy
BTS He went about the deck like a tiger cub glaring his hatred openly at Wolf Larsen and Johansen
BTS It has always been insisted that Ghent put the idea of the Oligarchy into the minds of the great capitalists
BTS The dog-musher surveyed the stricken dog
BTS But don't make the mistake of under-estimating me
BTS My feet were stinging from the bite of the frost and I hoped fervently that the sun would shine
BTS The rest was a dream no more than the memory of a dream
BTS It was on this adventure that he found the young weasel whose mother he had helped eat and he saw to it that the young weasel went the way of its mother
BTS Not alone was it aimed against Jackson
BTS Don't I know
BTS I think even the hunters are appalled at his cold-bloodedness
BTS And while all the world was torn with conflict we of the United States were not placid and peaceful
BTS It was his privilege to resent it with his teeth
BTS As we waited on the platform three trains thundered past bound west to Chicago
BTS He's your boat-puller when you've got him in the boat
BTS The man who had taken Mugridge's place had evidently joined his comrades in the forecastle
BTS ' he said
BTS but in reality it took away from him all honour and instead of being bully and master of the pack he now found himself hated and persecuted by the pack
BTS There was Baseek a grizzled old fellow that in his younger days had but to uncover his fangs to send White Fang cringing and crouching to the right about
BTS The United States and Brazil must both seek out other countries with undeveloped resources in order to unload the surpluses on them
BTS Then he fell and lay where he fell howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by
BTS The capture and secret execution of Everhard was the great event of the spring of 1932 A
BTS A little later in our conversation I asked him a simple little question about the liability of workingmen to accidents and received a statistical lecture in return
BTS But if he is so well-known for what he is I queried how is it that he can get men to ship with him
BTS No she announced
BTS John Thornton was dead
BTS They paused with instant alarm and looked at each other suspiciously
BTS You were unfortunate in having your life cast in easy places but you're developing and I like you the better for it
BTS The fire was burning low
BTS He stepped away from the rifle and White Fang's lifted lips descended covering his teeth
BTS And it seemed to me that my innocence of the realities of life had been complete indeed
BTS It was not till some time afterward that Ernest pointed out to me clearly that this general attitude of my class was something more than spontaneous that behind it were the hidden springs of an organized conduct
BTS As I reached the limit of my swing and prepared to rush back on the counter swing a great gong struck and thundered
BTS If you promise not to do it again she smiled
BTS I asked as I stepped to open the door for her
BTS It was a long cruel chase but he was better nourished than they and in the end outran them
BTS He was describing the sufferings of the unemployed as if with the wild idea of in some way touching their hearts and consciences
BTS The fog's lifted an' 'tis the port light iv a steamer that's crossin' our bow this blessed minute
BTS when the fibre of him had become tough and knotty
BTS And these perilous contacts from all these strange hands he must endure
BTS I must say though when we walked down to the Ghost to inspect more closely the task before us that the sight of the great masts lying in the water almost disheartened me
BTS The stockyards ghetto plant and everything were smouldering ruins
BTS At first my home was the tarpaulin
BTS Often in desperation he burst into long stretches of flight
BTS Still White Fang suspected
BTS It was drunk with success and little did it dream that that small handful of heroes had within them the power to rock it to its foundations
BTS But will you look at that
BTS They met him with the mass-formation otherwise he would have killed them one by one in a night
BTS The tide could not have carried the masts far to seaward and there had been no wind
BTS because I desire to live as you will desire to live
BTS A pair of beasts is what we were penned together and showing our teeth
BTS Give 'm hell you wolf
BTS I am courageous
BTS I dozed with my mouth full of food
BTS yet I could not but love her for it so sweetly womanly was it
BTS Do you know what a machine-breaker is
BTS There is a good example of it in this evening's paper
BTS His whole frame shook with the struggle
BTS This bit of the ferment we call Johnson' when he is no longer a bit of the ferment only dust and ashes will have no more nobility than any dust and ashes while I shall still be alive and roaring
BTS And for two generations the Group flourished
BTS Hunters there are who fail to return to the camp and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow greater than the prints of any wolf
BTS CHAPTER V THE PHILOMATHS Ernest was often at the house
BTS It seemed to him that he was in Fort McGurry
BTS But there was that in him deeper than all the law he had learned than the customs that had moulded him than his love for the master than the very will to live of himself
BTS What is done with this balance
BTS Oh he was not technically discharged
BTS And all that is the woman who wrote A Kiss Endured
BTS You'll get down out of that rigging and damn lively about it
BTS You have lulled your conscience to sleep with prattle of sweet ideals and dear moralities
BTS Ernest began by describing the army of revolution and as he gave the figures of its strength the votes cast in the various countries the assemblage began to grow restless
BTS He uncoiled his whip
BTS Dat Buck heem pool lak hell
BTS What visitant from the gloom of the deep was I to behold
BTS Neglecting the boats that remained to her she had altered her course so as to anticipate ours
BTS Bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh The whole world leaps to my will And the unslaked thirst of an Eden cursed Shall harrow the earth for its fill
BTS They had no inkling of such a patience
BTS Later in the morning I received a surprise of a totally different sort
BTS I I don't understand navigation you know I gasped
BTS This convention had been called to consider public immorality and the remedy for it
BTS I asked
BTS Wait till I get back to Dawson Beauty Smith threatened
BTS The trouble was precipitated by the Iron Heel
BTS I'm afraid it's coming
BTS Then why move at all since moving is living
BTS There is a patience of the wild dogged tireless persistent as life itself that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web the snake in its coils the panther in its ambuscade
BTS The hunters there were six of them to a man turned and regarded me
BTS When he was half-way out the Ghost took a long roll to windward and back again into the hollow between two seas
BTS Club and whip were both used upon him and he experienced the worst beating he had ever received in his life
BTS That's what you call a paradox isn't it
BTS for they worried me to distraction with their solicitude for my health and with their periodic inroads on my den when my orderly confusion upon which I prided myself was turned into worse confusion and less order though it looked neat enough to the eye
BTS But we could not stand still and do nothing in those ghastly silent streets
BTS At such times reason fled from White Fang and in his transports of rage he was even more mad than Beauty Smith
BTS was what he uttered
BTS Any jackass gets aboard one and runs it from hell to breakfast blowin' his whistle to beat the band and tellin' the rest of the world to look out for him because he's comin' and can't look out for himself
BTS Then he applied his teeth to the thong and in the space of ten seconds was free
BTS Why don't women wear their hair down always
BTS It was as though he had caught Ernest in a theft or a lie
BTS And make all haste I added as she turned toward her state-room
BTS He spasmodically ripped and tore with his fangs for a space
BTS But I saw the lights of Alcatraz where Ernest lay and found comfort in the thought of nearness to him
BTS and escaped
BTS And he was merciless
BTS When he saw Pike one of the new dogs a clever malingerer and thief slyly steal a slice of bacon when Perrault's back was turned he duplicated the performance the following day getting away with the whole chunk
BTS They move in order to eat in order that they may keep moving
BTS Believe me when I get to throwing bombs I'll do damage
BTS My hand was lifted at her door to knock when I recollected the smallness of the island
BTS Henry groaned as he passed from sleep to waking and demanded What's wrong now
BTS Why you who live on the land know that you house your poor people in the slums of cities and loose famine and pestilence upon them and that there still remain more poor people dying for want of a crust of bread and a bit of meat which is life destroyed than you know what to do with
BTS My muscles are growing harder and increasing in size
BTS We have never got the slightest clew to his identity
BTS Yet the failure of it accelerated his development
BTS He lay down low to the race whining eagerly his splendid body flashing forward leap by leap in the wan white moonlight
BTS Also there were many dogs
BTS he called hoarsely and with a note of fright in his voice
BTS She acknowledged her identity with a nod
BTS My headache had not gone away
BTS ' From which it is apparent that he is no metaphysician
BTS You know I collected every weapon on board
BTS And we're not dreaming now
BTS After all I thought it is better and finer to love than to be loved if it makes something in life so worth while that one is not loath to die for it
BTS But you do not realize Ernest answered
BTS He looked at the master and he looked at the dogs
BTS The small manufacturers and small business men who still survived were at the complete mercy of the Plutocracy
BTS But my spirit masters the trembling flesh and the qualms of the mind
BTS Railroad bridges and tunnels were blown up and trains were wrecked
BTS I'll be all right in a little while
BTS Or at least White Fang thought he was deserted until he smelled out the master's canvas clothes-bags alongside of him and proceeded to mount guard over them
BTS Van Weyden
BTS His feet clung to the earth with the same tenacity that he clung to life
BTS They were crazed by the smell of the food
BTS You have placed his immortal soul in jeopardy
BTS I was prepared for him again to set aside my question and was surprised at the readiness of his reply
BTS Very good
BTS Morning broke and we looked long in the growing light for our island
BTS The Plutocracy with its paltry quarter of a million of occupied members
BTS And White Fang resurrecting quite a deal of the old awe seemed to wilt and to shrink in upon himself and grow small as he cast about in his mind for a way to beat a retreat not too inglorious
BTS Work thou thy will with me
BTS Also he held White Fang's nose down to the slain hens and at the same time cuffed him soundly
BTS I speak not in reproach but in gratitude
BTS Let me see your hand
BTS We must accept the capitalistic stage in social evolution as about on a par with the earlier monkey stage
BTS It was the Plutocracy weighing and balancing that defeated us by dividing our strength
BTS To him Judge Scott was the keystone in the arch of injustice and upon Judge Scott he emptied the vials of his wrath and hurled the threats of his revenge yet to come
BTS It buys so much food
BTS We published it in our papers
BTS Pray how did you know I was here
BTS Then he leaped clear
BTS Still we increased our lead and when the boat had dropped astern several miles we hove to and waited
BTS Matt followed with the lamp and by its light they saw a man lying on his back in the snow
BTS and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe fearful that Buck and Spitz were at it
BTS Again that unnamable and unmistakable terror was in her eyes and she said almost in a whisper You are Lucifer
BTS At that moment Biedenbach addressed me as Mary and I turned and answered him
BTS But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind
BTS hated him for all the real and fancied favours he received
BTS It had indeed been bloody for they had drawn off and joined our other three boats in the attack on the remaining two of the enemy
BTS I disconnected it he said and just in the nick of time
BTS We've only got six dogs Henry said
BTS I guess we know our business best was the retort
BTS Also live things when they were large enough could give hurt
BTS He glanced at her a moment's amusement softening his features
BTS He was not used to fighting with that kind of dog and he was waiting for them to bring on the real dog
BTS The oligarchs believed their ethics in spite of the fact that biology and evolution gave them the lie
BTS Terror itself and the mystery of the unknown led to his living
BTS What's there to be afraid of
BTS Leach and Johnson took no part in the discussion and it was plain to see that their mates looked upon them as men for whom the worst was inevitable who were beyond hope and already dead
BTS That it was mockery made the situation more puzzling to her
BTS In a dark passage this guide struck a match and holding it close to his face slipped back his mask
BTS Labor can and will rule the world
BTS Like a cat White Fang bowed his hind-quarters in and with the feet digging into his enemy's abdomen above him he began to claw with long tearing-strokes
BTS I'll be good she said as a naughty child might say it
BTS The rest of the dogs were in like condition
BTS The white-skinned fair-haired savages who created that terrible pantheon were of the same fibre as he
BTS The boat was close at hand now and in desperate plight
BTS I saw the young fellow's hands clench at the insult and the blood crawl scarlet up his neck
BTS Before Avis Everhard was born John Stuart Mill in his essay ON LIBERTY wrote Wherever there is an ascendant class a large portion of the morality emanates from its class interests and its class feelings of superiority
BTS I am planted too solidly and stolidly upon the earth
BTS Take me ashore
BTS Bullets are liable to come aboard and I don't want you killed you know
BTS Wolf Larsen ordered
BTS Surely you will agree with me
BTS He nodded his head in a pleased way
BTS and it received easement only by the touch of the new god's presence
BTS He gave no warning with no snarl anticipated his own action
BTS Bill shook it off
BTS Here are the figures
BTS The return of the love-master was enough
BTS Or like a wise man looking upon fools and wishing he too were a fool I laughed
BTS Who knows
BTS But I fail to see that this steamer has any designs on your purse
BTS At the fall of darkness they swung the dogs into a cluster of spruce trees on the edge of the waterway and made a camp
BTS But there was one particular nightmare from which he suffered the clanking clanging monsters of electric cars that were to him colossal screaming lynxes
BTS Rockefeller began as a member of the proletariat and through thrift and cunning succeeded in developing the first perfect trust namely that known as Standard Oil
BTS I said with sudden solicitude
BTS It mastered it in you you cannot deny it because a crazy Cockney cook sharpened a knife
BTS When viewed in the light of formal logic there is not one thing of which to be ashamed
BTS Soon they have surpluses and are seeking other countries on which to unload
BTS That he allowed the master these liberties was no reason that he should be a common dog loving here and loving there everybody's property for a romp and good time
BTS The flood of fight ebbed down in him and releasing his prey he turned tail and scampered on across the open in inglorious retreat
BTS I'll not deny that I helped to give her that impression
BTS But he ought not to be
BTS His human fictions as you choose to call them make for nobility and manhood
BTS I was not thinking of taking them aboard when I made that promise he answered
BTS I don't know about wot you s'y Mr
BTS You know they never escaped
BTS But White Fang uncompanionable solitary morose scarcely looking to right or left redoubtable forbidding of aspect remote and alien was accepted as an equal by his puzzled elders
BTS He acquired a reputation for wickedness amongst the man-animals themselves
BTS They continued in the yards for half an hour
BTS and the proletariat owns four per cent of the total wealth
BTS Stick a knife in him and let his spirit free
BTS That night he waited for the master to return
BTS Spring came on once more and at the end of all their wandering they found not the Lost Cabin but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan
BTS What have become of the owners of the small drug stores that you forced to the wall
BTS You've discovered your own and learned to stand on them
BTS But disaster had come to the soldiers
BTS You are speaking professionally now are you not
BTS This was the pride of Dave as wheel-dog of Sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength
BTS but my man died
BTS And you absorbed the profits they had been making
BTS But at the end of the week the smoke ceased rising from the galley and he no longer showed himself on the poop
BTS He wrenched and writhed about convulsively
BTS They were grab-sharing with a vengeance
BTS Therefore the mind of the man is wrong
BTS He had become enamoured of proletarian life
BTS In 1914 A
BTS You noticed yourself the row the dogs made
BTS You have hardened your hearts
BTS It is true he worked with it
BTS nothing perhaps to the nights we should go through in this cockle-shell

BTS Nay in moments like this I almost do believe
BTS A living dog is better than a dead lion say I with the Preacher

BTS As for the Bishop he has no daughter
BTS Better so I answered
BTS I squirmed under the pain of it and half lifted my head
BTS Men were shaking hands it did not matter with whom and bubbling over in a general incoherent babel

BTS he cried
BTS He felt a vacancy in him a need for the hush and quietude of the stream and the cave in the cliff

BTS The resulting tangle was even worse but Buck took good care to keep the traces clear thereafter
BTS Then it was that that clannishness which was his to so extraordinary a degree asserted itself
BTS I cried
BTS And all the time though he did not look he could hear her snarling just one leap behind
BTS I've got some pull and I'll see if it can be managed
BTS Look
BTS No matter how terribly he was beaten he had always another growl

BTS Whether it was merely the expelled breath or his consciousness of his growing impotence I know not but his throat vibrated with a deep groan
BTS It was as though I were about to see a new and awful revelation of life
BTS They ate 'm hide an' all Bill announced
BTS As the evening wore on we learned more of his doings
BTS The two men looked at each other
BTS We have no words to waste on you
BTS And now he said let me tell you about that revolution
BTS But somebody had to do the cooking and whatever else his shortcomings Beauty Smith could cook
BTS He did not dare travel until dark
BTS In the first days after the birth of the cubs One Eye had journeyed several times back to the Indian camp and robbed the rabbit snares
BTS Not only that but he is very lonely
BTS Always my meditations led me back to him
BTS But what a furor was raised in the local papers
BTS What are we to do then
BTS Then the gag swung to the side with an abrupt swiftness the great sail boomed like a cannon and the three rows of reef-points slatted against the canvas like a volley of rifles
BTS By means of the watch-tackle I had made a new one I heaved the butt of the foremast across the rail and then lowered it to the deck
BTS The boats came aboard from every side at once
BTS No one knew of the first man
BTS Now Buck he said
BTS I felt that under the guise of an intellectual swashbuckler was a delicate and sensitive spirit
BTS I trusted my life to it
BTS and so I considered with grave deliberation for a moment
BTS And the more I thought about it the more it appeared that my duty to myself lay in doing what he had advised lay in joining forces with Johnson and Leach and working for his death
BTS And well he revenged himself
BTS When the topmen clear the raffle with their clasp-knives in their teeth' she quoted at me

BTS The day had been like some horrible dream
BTS He was too ponderous and slow
BTS Can you guess why I have sent for you
BTS Then came trouble and violence
BTS Before him was bounding the faint patch of white he had discovered
BTS When we hove to a hasty though orderly confusion reigned
BTS So saying he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna sausage down upon the bar
BTS A feud ages old was between them and she for one would see to it that he was reminded
BTS But I never do see the obvious you know she laughed back
BTS His naked fangs and writhing lips were uniformly efficacious rarely failing to send a bellowing on-rushing dog back on its haunches

BTS Kowalt cried
BTS One night not long after the return Scott and Matt sat at a game of cribbage preliminary to going to bed
BTS Tell me Ernest said if this is not true
BTS and the storms held no terror for us
BTS It was true that they prattled sweet little ideals and dear little moralities but in spite of their prattle the dominant key of the life they lived was materialistic

BTS No you misunderstand the Bishop answered
BTS He had not rushed forward after the manner of other dogs

BTS It can be taken away from you
BTS And such a piece of meat was of value
BTS White Fang caught glimpses of it disappearing amongst the trees

BTS Wolf Larsen was smoking a cigar and examining the patent log which the Ghost usually towed astern but which had been hauled in for some purpose
BTS Once the feeling strong upon me that my little world and all the world was turning over I thought of Ernest as the cause of it
BTS He did not know how abject a coward the other was and thought he was coming back intent on fighting
BTS I struggled at the oars till I was played out
BTS Lashing the two topmasts together and making allowance for their unequal length at the point of intersection I attached the double block of the main throat-halyards
BTS As in his puppyhood the looming bulks of the tepees man-reared had affected him as manifestations of power so was he affected now by the houses and the huge fort all of massive logs
BTS and with the jib-halyard to the windlass I knew Maud was capable of hoisting that most necessary sail
BTS I queried a moment later after having rowed a few more strokes along the beach
BTS And you hear that fellow with a frog in his throat a steam schooner as near as I can judge crawlin' in from the Heads against the tide
BTS Then he remembered and turning on the back-track started for home carrying the ptarmigan in his mouth

BTS When the grey cub came back to life and again took interest in the far white wall he found that the population of his world had been reduced
BTS Matt cried
BTS It's the wrong direction but we'll get out somehow
BTS Everything had happened at once the blow the counter-blow the squeal of agony from the porcupine the big cat's squall of sudden hurt and astonishment
BTS The other dog made no advances nor received any
BTS Buck duplicated the manoeuvre this time to the left
BTS Describe her verse as the critics have described it as sublimated and spiritual and you have described her body
BTS I envy you I envy you
BTS A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river
BTS They were no match at all were it not for their arrows and spears and clubs
BTS I had been resting all my life and did not know it
BTS He was overthrown
BTS Life had become too populous
BTS Buck heard the chaffering saw the money pass between the man and the Government agent and knew that the Scotch half-breed and the mail-train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of Perrault and Francois and the others who had gone before
BTS Notice the sleeve of his left arm Ernest said gently
BTS Suddenly they saw its back end drop down as into a rut and the gee-pole with Hal clinging to it jerk into the air
BTS Far as it might have seemed no man has ever seen very far into Wolf Larsen's soul or seen it at all of this I am convinced
BTS What men have done I can do
BTS Many militia officers were murdered and many militiamen were executed by drumhead court martial
BTS A few minutes of regulating sufficed to put it on its course again when I returned to the preparation of breakfast
BTS He had lifted his eyes to me at the commencement of my outburst and followed me complacently until I had done and stood before him breathless and dismayed
BTS I could have rubbed my eyes as I looked
BTS N-no she considered
BTS When that goes I go
BTS and it was not till we were well settled in our new home that we had opportunity really to wonder and speculate about the Bishop's doings
BTS I was surprised considering the fierce struggle in the forecastle at the superficiality of his hurts and I pride myself that I dressed them dexterously
BTS Bah
BTS Ten knots twelve knots eleven knots varying from time to time is the speed we are making
BTS Some of the heaviest fighting had occurred there he said many of the streets being rendered impassable by the heaps of the dead
BTS The cub had never seen man yet the instinct concerning man was his
BTS When she had slipped this on over her head I exchanged the boy's cap she wore for a man's cap large enough to cover her hair and when the flap was turned down to completely cover her neck and ears
BTS No
BTS There were the spare oars very true
BTS I went up the steerage companion-way two steps at a time with nothing distinct in my mind except joy and the hope that Maud would sleep on until the surprise breakfast was quite ready for her
BTS For a long while I remained standing where she had left me
BTS Then he wormed his way forward slowly toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates
BTS A chance bomb must have exploded among them for the mob checked until its dead and dying formed the wave had white-capped and flung forward its foam of living fighting slaves
BTS Across roofs and through buildings they made their way till they found themselves looking down upon the close-packed soldiers
BTS Wot 're you good for any'wy
BTS Ah it is growing dark and darker
BTS I could weep for the poor creatures did I but forget poor old fat Louis and the troubles before him
BTS but they were frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence
BTS He revelled in the vengeance he wreaked upon his kind
BTS But I have discovered a place where I can get three for ten cents
BTS This it was I am certain the most indescribable of blood-curdling sounds that threw me into a panic
BTS I'm strongest at noon yet under the moon I stiffen the bunt of her sail
BTS You are worse off than Omar I said
BTS But White Fang knew that he had broken the law of the gods
BTS And through it all moved the Iron Heel impassive and deliberate shaking up the whole fabric of the social structure in its search for the comrades combing out the Mercenaries the labor castes and all its secret services punishing without mercy and without malice suffering in silence all retaliations that were made upon it and filling the gaps in its fighting line as fast as they appeared
BTS I am afraid she whispered with a shiver
BTS but for the great majority of the religious heaven and hell are incidental to right and wrong
BTS Hump he said slowly you can't do it
BTS It was vain to think of One Ear so outdistancing his pursuers as to be able to cut across their circle in advance of them and to regain the sled
BTS It was merely the logical development of what in the nineteenth century had been known as grab-sharing
BTS In your recent encounters you failed to shake the masters
BTS I was angry with myself for being caught in so cowardly a position crouching on the floor
BTS He took no quarter and gave none
BTS Out of the flux of transition the new institutions were forming more definitely and taking on the appearance and attributes of permanence
BTS The boat was near enough for us to make out that it was larger than any sealing boat and built on different lines
BTS But before I make it I shall challenge you to point out error in it or to remain a silent metaphysician
BTS Wherever there was trouble and uproar in camp fighting and squabbling or the outcry of a squaw over a bit of stolen meat they were sure to find White Fang mixed up in it and usually at the bottom of it
BTS I cleared my throat of a huskiness which prevented speech
BTS So he ate the ptarmigan
BTS Idealist and romanticist that I was and always had been in spite of my analytical nature yet I had failed till now in grasping much of the physical characteristics of love
BTS It caused him to feel a vague sweet gladness and he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what
BTS All powers seemed his all potentialities why then was he no more than the obscure master of a seal-hunting schooner with a reputation for frightful brutality amongst the men who hunted seals
BTS A section of the mob tore itself loose and surged in after her
BTS No man can be intellectually insulted
BTS She bore a charmed life and prospered amid dangers and alarms
BTS while beyond were the tawny hills and upland pastures
BTS It is not the way of the Wild to like movement
BTS Fifty-two Congressmen were in prison and fully three hundred more of our leaders
BTS I asked
BTS It was the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the work and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity
BTS Well
BTS In fact we call that period the Dark Ages
BTS He did not know what they said but he could see the man and Grey Beaver talking together
BTS Scott asked nudging White Fang with his foot
BTS As Austin Lewis says speaking of that time those to whom the command 'Feed my lambs' had been given saw those lambs sold into slavery and worked to death without a protest
BTS The glade ended abruptly at the steep bank of a stream
BTS He passed a rope over his shoulder a man-trace and pulled with the dogs
BTS You cannot escape us
BTS And he knew I could not splice
BTS Yet such fears were groundless
BTS He studied the wood-mice and tried to dig them out of their burrows
BTS but further he was the ideal master
BTS Buck hurried on swiftly and stealthily every nerve straining and tense alert to the multitudinous details which told a story all but the end
BTS Maud asked cheerfully when the task was accomplished and I pulled on my mittens
BTS There was no need for his working at all because Ernest managed to earn enough from his translating to take care of the three of us
BTS Johansen called vainly for him to come down
BTS To White Fang Beauty Smith was a veritable if terrible god
BTS How great the risk I realized when I was once more buried beneath the pounding seas and clinging for life to the pinrail at the foot of the foremast
BTS The tongues of all were out and lolling the white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight
BTS He laughed next day when he read the newspapers and then he grew angry to a degree that eliminated all tonic qualities
BTS This time the man succeeded only in partly blocking and his throat was torn open
BTS I don't know was my answer
BTS Born to be a hunter of meat though he did not know it he blundered upon meat just outside his own cave-door on his first foray into the world
BTS And amid all this bursting rending throbbing of awakening life under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes like wayfarers to death staggered the two men the woman and the huskies
BTS I asked impulsively for he had voiced my own fear
BTS I never knew before what money was good for
BTS The cost of advertising was amazing in those helter- skelter times
BTS Nor could we learn anything about him except the reiterated statements that slight hopes were still held for his recovery
BTS What's the matter
BTS He was in a panic of terror
BTS The carriage drove on and still Collie blocked White Fang's way
BTS Clear that raffle
BTS Oofty-Oofty cried his keen eyes reading its number in the one second when it lifted clear of the foam and upside down
BTS CHAPTER XV LAST DAYS It was near the end of January 1913 that the changed attitude of the Oligarchy toward the favored unions was made public
BTS All this the two men saw in the first instant
BTS He had begun to romp with them in a feeble awkward way and even to squabble his little throat vibrating with a queer rasping noise the forerunner of the growl as he worked himself into a passion
BTS Though the declaration of my love urged and trembled on my tongue a thousand times I knew that it was no time for such a declaration
BTS ' A different thing from class hatred he replied
BTS But it can scarcely be said that White Fang was a member of the gang
BTS He had got upon his feet his ears cocked towards the door and he was listening intently
BTS Even the grim south-western promontory showed less grim and here and there where the sea-spray wet its surface high lights flashed and dazzled in the sun
BTS And there's not much reason against his bein' a sled-dog again
BTS And yet Grey Beaver was as a child-god among these white-skinned ones
BTS We are not brutal and savage
BTS Hurled into hell he was unbeaten
BTS You cannot be dogmatic with truth when you deal with me
BTS The mastiff shook his head growled hoarsely and plunged at White Fang
BTS Once more the Ghost bore away before the storm this time so submerging herself that for some seconds I thought she would never reappear
BTS Instantly and quite unconsciously Dr
BTS There was a great fluttering and flapping of canvas and reef-points most welcome to my ears then she filled away on the other tack
BTS That's a lie Wolf Larsen I said just as quietly as before
BTS the Bishop said
BTS The remaining two boats had been captured by our five and the seven were grouped together waiting to be picked up
BTS So we paused a moment and looked back
BTS And still there was that hint of the feebleness of the blind in his walk
BTS My next thought was that Maud and I might yet escape
BTS Till dinner-time she corrected remembering the arrangement on the Ghost
BTS Van Weyden fore and aft and it was only unofficially that Wolf Larsen himself ever addressed me as Hump
BTS His oily insinuating tones his greasy smile and his monstrous self-conceit grated on my nerves till sometimes I was all in a tremble
BTS Something might happen
BTS In strange villages he had encountered the hands of the children and learned that they were cruel to hurt
BTS Goo' night everybody
BTS Wolf 'tis what he is
BTS The knuckles were skinned and inflamed clear across the fingers swollen the nails rimmed with black
BTS He had a feeling of security that was belied by all his experience with men
BTS He looked it and the piercing glitter that arose at times in his eyes was the same piercing glitter I had observed in the eyes of caged leopards and other preying creatures of the wild
BTS Spitz as lead-dog and acknowledged master of the team felt his supremacy threatened by this strange Southland dog
BTS To bring forgetfulness or the light of gladness into those poor tired eyes of his--what greater joy could have blessed me than that
BTS I slept more soundly than usual that night
BTS They were awed by what they had already seen of Wolf Larsen's character while the tale of woe they speedily heard in the forecastle took the last bit of rebellion out of them
BTS Still it was not over the hole
BTS Ernest insisted
BTS Taking the sled as the centre of the circle that One Ear was making Bill planned to tap that circle at a point in advance of the pursuit
BTS It is a great gloriously coated wolf like and yet unlike all other wolves
BTS He said nothing
BTS Possibly in her whole life it was the most terrible snarl she ever gave
BTS Suddenly he snapped striking with his fangs like a snake
BTS so he was conceived as in their own image as a cloud a pillar of fire a tangible physical something which the mind of the Israelites could grasp
BTS I had solved the problem which had arisen through the shortness of the shears
BTS Get in the topsails and jibs and make a good job of it
BTS They have a parboiled appearance are afflicted with hang-nails while the nails are broken and discoloured and the edges of the quick seem to be assuming a fungoid sort of growth
BTS The shrewdest will-making lawyers were called in to make wills that could not be broken
BTS There was something in the fibre of White Fang's being that made his lordship a thing to be desired else he would not have come back from the Wild when he did to tender his allegiance
BTS He preferred suffering in freedom to all the happiness of a comfortable servility
BTS The young man was genuinely astonished
BTS The pure air was like nectar
BTS It was the safest route
BTS But White Fang could not believe
BTS To give point to unending pursuit of the leader Mit-sah favoured him over the other dogs
BTS Those who hurried up heard him cursing Buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly
BTS and while he circled he watched the club so as to dodge it if thrown by Francois for he was become wise in the way of clubs
BTS He studied it with unceasing vigilance
BTS Ernest was right he told me as soon as he had returned home
BTS I mistered him and sirred him no longer washed no more greasy pots and peeled no more potatoes
BTS and steady itself with slight oscillations
BTS An' you're half eaten from the way you're goin' on about it
BTS But at the moment of contact Thomas Mugridge cried out
BTS Deef I am and dumb as ye should be for the sake iv your mother
BTS was Johnson's cry
BTS They're goin' to get us
BTS Later on that day Kiche and White Fang strayed into the edge of the woods next to the camp
BTS Francois called him and sought him in vain
BTS I am at your disposal
BTS But how
BTS Also I saw a great wave curling and foaming poised far above the rail
BTS but the dead know not anything neither have they any more a reward
BTS This I know I did my best
BTS Doesn't the Standard Oil Trust own a score of the ocean lines
BTS His father Elmo a huge St
BTS As usual the Oligarchy will believe it has done right
BTS He made one desperate attempt to pull out on the trail
BTS It is a plot
BTS In the morning the door opened and Matt stepped outside
BTS And by this ascertained standard White Fang treated them accordingly
BTS And what is he
BTS The railroad might just as well have owned my quarry and hired me to run it
BTS Then what he expected began
BTS He was phlegmatic stolid to such a degree that one could not but wonder how the Revolution had any meaning to him at all
BTS One of the hunters a tall loose-jointed chap named Henderson was going aft at the time from the steerage the name the hunters facetiously gave their midships sleeping quarters to the cabin
BTS I have never thought so clearly
BTS Everything was happening quickly
BTS The grey cub could not understand this
BTS I guess he's digested by this time an' cavortin' over the landscape in the bellies of twenty different wolves was Henry's epitaph on this the latest lost dog
BTS And furthermore the war would consume many national surpluses reduce the armies of unemployed that menaced all countries and give the Oligarchy a breathing space in which to perfect its plans and carry them out
BTS Quite true
BTS Watch out
BTS But this was no canyon
BTS The next instant Weedon Scott had White Fang by the throat and was dragging him clear
BTS A puff of smoke broke from the Macedonia's deck we heard a heavy report and a round hole took form in the stretched canvas of our mainsail
BTS A stout man with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck came out and signed the book for the driver
BTS Beauty Smith's remaining leg left the ground and his whole body seemed to lift into the air as he turned over backward and struck the snow
BTS So is desire like fire
BTS The sounds from below soon died away
BTS He knew laughter and the meaning of it
BTS I asked
BTS Damp and soggy where it was not sharp and rocky buffeted by storm winds and lashed by the sea with the air continually a-tremble with the bellowing of two hundred thousand amphibians it was a melancholy and miserable sojourning-place
BTS It was a time of visions and miracles while seers and prophetesses were legion
BTS There was perfect quiet in the room
BTS Scott turned to see
BTS but before that flaming sheet of death nothing could live
BTS Everhard Bishop Morehouse said
BTS I learned it myself in English ships
BTS The danger lay in the heavy fog which blanketed the bay and of which as a landsman I had little apprehension
BTS and when the breeze stirred them into huge movements he cowered down in fear keeping his eyes warily upon them and prepared to spring away if they attempted to precipitate themselves upon him
BTS But this idea was dispelled when it was learned that he had sold all his possessions--his city mansion his country house at Menlo Park his paintings and collections and even his cherished library
BTS You surely do not dream that I'll consider them in dealing with you
BTS And it is all very beautiful this shaking off of the flesh and soaring of the imprisoned spirit
BTS I thought he'd let drive at him on the spot
BTS Why Judge Caldwell and Colonel Ingram belong to the same lodge and the same club
BTS Its planking was three-quarters of an inch thick
BTS Ran you right into a trap
BTS When they halted the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead
BTS Kowalt spoke
BTS There was no more reason that I should stand and face these human beasts than that I should stand and face an infuriated bull
BTS In these unions more favorable conditions will continue to prevail
BTS Cooky by the time you've finished pots and pans you'll be wanted on deck
BTS The two men however were quite cheerful
BTS His face remained expressionless as ever
BTS Also the house was built against the perpendicular wall
BTS He smiled at my recital
BTS and the bull-dog promptly shifted his grip getting in closer mangling more and more of the fur-folded flesh throttling White Fang more severely than ever
BTS The very last of all I saw
BTS Maud was still asleep
BTS Not to be tiresome I shall say that I fetched the book from his state-room and read Caliban aloud
BTS I've thought about it off and on while not wanting to think of it
BTS If you strike that dog again I'll kill you he at last managed to say in a choking voice
BTS Comrades turned traitor by permission in order to win to the wonder cities and there execute our sentences on the real traitors
BTS But you can't break the machines Ernest replied
BTS I glanced over them noting with astonishment such names as Shakespeare Tennyson Poe and De Quincey
BTS Put down that gun
BTS I looked
BTS Power
BTS It did not occur to him that this fearlessness was founded upon experience and knowledge
BTS I've seen too many of 'em cut up an' gouged an' chawed not to know
BTS The law was being lived about him by all live things and he himself was part and parcel of the law
BTS In the summer the fish failed
BTS Using the sled-lashing for a heaving rope and with the aid of the dogs he hoisted the coffin to the top of the scaffold
BTS But and his voice changed and the light went out of his face what is this condition in which I find myself
BTS Concentration is perfect
BTS Pike who pulled at Buck's heels and who never put an ounce more of his weight against the breast-band than he was compelled to do was swiftly and repeatedly shaken for loafing
BTS Buck simply smothered him by virtue of superior weight and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to whine for mercy
BTS There had been no reservation on White Fang's part and the bond was not to be broken easily
BTS Horner and Smoke had been displaying a gallantry toward Maud Brewster ludicrous in itself and inoffensive to her but to him evidently distasteful
BTS You poor poor dears she cried sympathetically why don't you pull hard
BTS But this time before he dozed again he tied a burning pine-knot to his right hand
BTS No matter what you do under your old tactics you are doomed to defeat if for no other reason because the masters control the courts
BTS Making the watch-tackle fast I hove on the windlass and brought in the mast inch by inch till its top tilted down to the deck and finally its whole length lay on the deck
BTS Henry sat down on the sled and watched
BTS It was probably the first time he had been aloft in his life
BTS A panic in a crowd which partakes of a sort of community of interest is not so terrible as a panic when one is by oneself
BTS In the meantime the fire remained unbuilt the camp half pitched and the dogs unfed
BTS The next thing to watch out for is bed sores
BTS It seems asleep
BTS It may cripple you some but all the same you'll be learning to walk
BTS Hearst persisted
BTS Not that
BTS Nine years ago we socialists thought that law was aimed against labor
BTS We can feel them
BTS The master's voice was sufficient
BTS he cried
BTS He had not moved
BTS And every time the hand descended the ears flattened down and a cavernous growl surged in his throat
BTS It seems as though you're standing on your own legs at last Hump we heard him say
BTS They had died so easily
BTS She pointed in the direction of the sea and wind
BTS I left Maud to pull on it while I went below
BTS Maud was already rearranging his pillow
BTS Then the rope tightened mercilessly while Buck struggled in a fury his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely
BTS Chicago is to be sacrificed but it shall be Chicago alone
BTS Her own ears with a snuggling movement laid their sharp points backward and down against the head for a moment while her mouth opened and her tongue lolled peaceably out and in this way she expressed that she was pleased and satisfied
BTS This breaking of wills was a peculiar feature of the period
BTS This brief description is all that Endeavour Island merits
BTS Poor driven people of the abyss hunted helots--they lay there as the rabbits in California after a drive
BTS They were young girls brave souls and passionate lovers of liberty Lora Peterson who disappeared in 1922 and Kate Bierce who later married Du Bois and who is still with us with eyes lifted to to-morrow's sun that heralds in the new age
BTS Had the cub thought in man-fashion he might have epitomised life as a voracious appetite and the world as a place wherein ranged a multitude of appetites pursuing and being pursued hunting and being hunted eating and being eaten all in blindness and confusion with violence and disorder a chaos of gluttony and slaughter ruled over by chance merciless planless endless
BTS ' Yes sir I corrected
BTS She is still asleep I answered
BTS He too had seen it the Macedonia guessing his manoeuvre and failing by a moment in anticipating it
BTS When he heard Thornton's command repeated he partly reared out of the water throwing his head high as though for a last look then turned obediently toward the bank
BTS We might fail to carry out our decrees against our enemies such as the Pococks for instance
BTS The Wolf I said the Wolf
BTS He went on and traced his life in the mills the learning of the horseshoeing trade and his meeting with the socialists
BTS Asmunsen agreed are the creatures of the trusts
BTS Don't take my word for it
BTS We were a dozen feet apart
BTS Then you must promise something else I ventured
BTS Promises and agreements were broken and most drastic punishments visited upon even petty offenders
BTS A brisk wind was blowing into the cove and though the water was calm rapid work was required to get us safely out
BTS And it was the same with our organization
BTS I came upon it abruptly as a wanderer in the country would come upon a flowing stream
BTS The wind would instantly capsize the boat
BTS In one run they made a sixty-mile dash from the foot of Lake Le Barge to the White Horse Rapids
BTS White Fang listening to the wordy war and watching the angry gestures knew that his act was justified
BTS Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet
BTS If he turned upon them Mit-sah would throw the stinging lash of the whip into his face
BTS This was meat the same as his mother gave him only it was alive between his teeth and therefore better
BTS It was as if some strong anxiety had wasted it
BTS Oh shut up
BTS I am to lie she said in steady rebellious tones by speech and action to lie
BTS I am inclined to the latter way of accounting for it
BTS He smirked greasily up into the face of Wolf Larsen who seemed not to see him
BTS But he is too sure too sure
BTS The pain of the beating was dull and distant just as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and distant
BTS I knew also that weapons would not come in amiss and I re-entered Wolf Larsen's state-room to get his rifle and shot-gun
BTS Listen to that will you
BTS Everybody seemed interested in what was going on amid ships
BTS But Beauty Smith knew the ways of Indians
BTS You will observe there I said a slight trembling
BTS To the end of the boom I had likewise rigged a hoisting tackle
BTS In some respects despite his great economic and sociological contributions and his work as a general leader in the Revolution his organization of the Fighting Groups must be regarded as his greatest achievement
BTS She had made no noise whatever had not even moved
BTS And Buck was merciless
BTS This division of society made by Everhard is in accordance with that made by Lucien Sanial one of the statistical authorities of that time
BTS On this night sleeping under my beloved shears I was aroused by his footsteps on the deck
BTS Throw your weight against the gee-pole right and left and break it out
BTS Instead of coming back he was carried away to a hospital with a bullet through his lungs and another through the fleshy part of his neck
BTS Close in under the sheltering rock Buck made his nest
BTS We will hail you brothers and we will fight shoulder to shoulder in the cause of humanity
BTS You sir are a poor gamester
BTS Of all places the Club gathered that night at the Pertonwaithe house
BTS Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle
BTS The unknown with all its terrors rushed upon him and he shrank back instinctively into the shelter of the bush
BTS As Spencer says the data of any particular science are partially unified knowledge
BTS It got half of it he announced
BTS Labor was striking here there and everywhere
BTS and I forgave him his materialism because of his tremendous work in the world performed without thought of soul-gain thereby and because of his so exceeding modesty of spirit that prevented him from having pride and regal consciousness of himself and his soul
BTS At the rear of the sled toiled a second man
BTS In reality the country was ruled by what were called POLITICAL MACHINES
BTS I used to belong to the union
BTS You cannot steer night and day and for ever
BTS What do you mean by that
BTS I used to refute him by telling him that I measured his immortality by the wings of his soul and that I should have to live endless aeons in order to achieve the full measurement
BTS Even as late as that period cream and butter were still crudely extracted from cow's milk
BTS He was cordially detested by the proletariat of both countries
BTS Only I don't know what hit me
BTS The leg-bar is not always worn graciously
BTS His shoulder was exposed
BTS Mr
BTS The whole population including the favored labor castes was given a course of outrageous treatment
BTS He was not a free agent Ernest said
BTS It was at Fort Yukon that White Fang saw his first white men
BTS In the matter of meat his luck had been all in the beginning
BTS Over fifty per cent are thralls by virtue of the fact that they are merely tenants or are mortgaged
BTS Perhaps if I were to step boldly ashore they would cut for it and I could not catch up with one
BTS I was Mr
BTS Buck did not cry out
BTS However I continued Miss Brewster is right in contending that temptation is temptation whether the man yield or overcome
BTS Yet his conclusions were as sharp and distinct as those achieved by men
BTS A flight of quail thrummed off through the thickets
BTS After it has paid its expenses does it consume the remainder
BTS ' And yet again not only is your small combination not a trust but you are aware yourself of its lack of strength
BTS And I knew a score of happy complacent families that had received those dividends and by that much had profited by Jackson's blood
BTS If the sight of him drove these strange dogs upon him so much the better for him so much the worse for them
BTS Knots and ridges and mounds of muscles writhed and bunched under the skin
BTS sitting down in the coal-box and nursing his new hurt by rocking back and forth
BTS How did you happen to get your arm caught in the machine
BTS And the cub felt that somehow he had escaped a great hurt
BTS Indeed she was a slender delicate woman as women go but to me she was so ethereally slender and delicate that I was quite prepared for her arm to crumble in my grasp
BTS The very negroes that waited on us knew that something terrible was impending
BTS But this vindication did not satisfy
BTS Grey Beaver refused to sell the dog
BTS Joe was sourer than ever and Sol-leks was unapproachable blind side or other side
BTS I am glad you are as small a bit as you are I said
BTS Luckily as the outcome proved he had not divulged his discoveries to any one
BTS At times it seemed impossible either that I had ever lived a placid peaceful life in a college town or else that I had become a revolutionist inured to scenes of violence and death
BTS He never took his eyes from the god thrusting his head forward with ears flattened back and hair involuntarily rising and cresting on his neck
BTS Nay Grey Beaver himself sometimes tossed him a piece of meat and defended him against the other dogs in the eating of it
BTS Countless heads were broken and there were many killed
BTS His nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the life on the heels of which he was travelling
BTS I cried scrambling to my feet
BTS All hands were on deck now and all eyes were aloft where a human life was at grapples with death
BTS What I mean is that it was the face of a man who either did nothing contrary to the dictates of his conscience or who had no conscience
BTS The tears were in his eyes this great strong hero of mine
BTS His eyes were half closed and the surface of them was glassy
BTS Parsons took the wheel and the pursuit continued
BTS The sailors now crowded boldly aft grinning and shuffling to watch the pummelling of the hated Cockney
BTS and as he cooked everything that was eaten aboard I was compelled to select what I ate with great circumspection choosing from the least dirty of his concoctions
BTS the empty upholstered seats littered with all the evidences of sudden flight such as packages hand satchels umbrellas and wraps
BTS I remember the review she went on hastily becoming aware of the awkwardness of her remark
BTS for these were the very young and the very old the feeble and the sick the helpless and the hopeless all the wreckage of the ghetto
BTS But the dogs could never learn the lesson to leave him alone in camp
BTS I always did think there was somethin' wrong with Fatty anyway
BTS I must have time to think I knew
BTS It manifested itself as a fear strong within her that made her prevent One Eye from more closely inspecting the cubs he had fathered
BTS The famine was gone
BTS She could get meat and she never failed to bring him his share
BTS It attracted him as a candle attracts a moth
BTS Who was he
BTS And there were many Jacksons--hundreds of them in the mills alone as Jackson himself had said
BTS while he fought with his fangs alone and she fought with her sharp-clawed feet as well
BTS Here we may reign secure
BTS I found myself strangely afraid of this woman I was escorting aft
BTS And where is he
BTS The mate was the first but mark me words there'll be more dead men before the trip is done with
BTS And furthermore I hold that whatever is horrible in industrial society is due to the ignorance of the capitalist class
BTS Many other similar disconcerting omissions will be noticed in the Manuscript
BTS and walk off with it for a hundred yards
BTS There was no record of his death
BTS And there will be counter-palace revolutions of the oligarchs and sometimes the one and sometimes the other will be in power
BTS Her temper was now shorter than ever
BTS Who shipped you anyway
BTS Family life ceased
BTS There will be violence and murder now and sorrowing widows and orphans
BTS The mob came on slowly
BTS Yer not 'arf bad 'Ump
BTS So it was that the regular troops fought for their lives as well as did the farmers
BTS How fast is she ebbin'
BTS I know that I was lost in a great wonder almost a stupor this then was a woman
BTS but Buck was too clever ever again to be caught red-handed
BTS She was in striking contrast to Wolf Larsen
BTS With the suppression of the socialist publishing houses his meagre royalties ceased and he was hard-put to make a living
BTS Once a writer friend of mine had owned the ranch
BTS Any of them contained possible death
BTS In a way he was prepared to do this
BTS Nor was it my father merely nor the controversial dinners that drew him there
BTS As Mit-sah and Kloo-kooch had belonged to Grey Beaver sharing his food his fire and his blankets so now at Sierra Vista belonged to the love-master all the denizens of the house
BTS Dismay sat on their faces and before they could recover Ernest struck again
BTS And now it's your chance
BTS for he cowered perceptibly and dragged himself on
BTS His mother verified it
BTS He seems to have been badly treated I confessed
BTS And such is the paradox of living this ecstasy comes when one is most alive and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive
BTS Old One Eye was feeling the urge of an impulse that was in turn an instinct that had come down to him from all the fathers of wolves
BTS Calvin sat in uncomfortable silence
BTS CHAPTER XXXV Next day the mast-steps clear and everything in readiness we started to get the two topmasts aboard
BTS Nothing much he began slowly except that the gown you wear is stained with blood
BTS They talked it over at meal-time and over their last pipes before going to bed and one night they held a consultation
BTS Almost before I knew it and without one serious hitch I had the mainmast stepped
BTS But how in the name of the great Sardanapolis he knows you're goin' is what gets me the dog-musher continued innocently
BTS Unable to turn his back on the fanged danger and go on the bull would be driven into paroxysms of rage
BTS The clay of him was so moulded
BTS Her lips met the press of mine and by what strange trick of the imagination I know not the scene in the cabin of the Ghost flashed upon me when she had pressed her fingers lightly on my lips and said Hush hush
BTS She ran frantically hysterically straining to the utmost advertising the effort she was making with every leap and all the time White Fang slid smoothly away from her silently without effort gliding like a ghost over the ground
BTS Once he looked straight across at me and in his face was all the dumb pathos of the wounded and hunted animal
BTS Also I was awkward
BTS Only way to find out is to find out
BTS There was no doubt that we had escaped unseen
BTS He shook his head ominously and looked forward without hope to the fall elections
BTS but at that time Lip-lip was another man's dog and Mit-sah had never dared more than to shy an occasional stone at him
BTS And since that day of prophecy have passed away the three centuries of the Iron Heel and the four centuries of the Brotherhood of Man and to-day we tread the roads and dwell in the cities that the oligarchs built
BTS In no time I was on the bottom
BTS Books and brains and bravery
BTS Two years ago he dismasted the Ghost in a gale on Bering Sea whereupon the present masts were put in which are stronger and heavier in every way
BTS Well consider henceforth that I smile internally with my soul if you please my soul
BTS Undreamed of
BTS I suppose you're like Mr
BTS no
BTS Alone all alone in the midst of millions of his fellow-men he was fighting his fight
BTS The teeth of one had closed upon his arm
BTS The divisions of society have become too widely separated
BTS It served me right this time
BTS At the dark end of the first day we returned exhausted to our little cove towing the mainmast behind us
BTS The boat was now very close and I could make out plainly that it was lying head to wind and sea and dragging on its mast and sail which had been thrown overboard and made to serve as a sea-anchor
BTS A couple of hundred feet in length and width it was half of that in depth
BTS And it lost Jackson's case for him
BTS He extended the fire into a large circle
BTS Kelly come aft and slack off the main-sheet
BTS It was because nothing daunted him that he had been chosen for government courier
BTS Sometimes he was under sometimes on top
BTS Alas how we underestimated the strength of the enemy
BTS In short I'm going to play the hog myself and not for one day but for the rest of the season if we're in luck
BTS Look at 'im run
BTS it was a mere expletive but it came from his soul
BTS I did not stop to see what had become of the small boat but sprang to the jib-sheet
BTS Through chapter after chapter he is worried by the one event that cometh to all alike
BTS Successful in this the old simile of the needle in the haystack would be mild indeed compared with his brother's chance of finding him
BTS The snarls ceased
BTS The weakest and the more worthless were eaten first
BTS CHAPTER IV SLAVES OF THE MACHINE The more I thought of Jackson's arm the more shaken I was
BTS Colonel Ingram and Judge Caldwell are pretty friendly
BTS It is crystallizing now
BTS Hartman never came out of that entrance
BTS for she sang to me before she went to an early bed
BTS I was being borne down suffocated
BTS He looked at Kiche licking her puppy and stopping now and then to snarl at him
BTS Here the hunters stored the ammunition-boxes they carried in the boats and here but a few feet from their noisy revels I took possession of two boxes
BTS Our boats were rowing as well as sailing
BTS He shook it and grinned sheepishly at the courier who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they were beaten
BTS and by afternoon I was at work on the windlass
BTS Pickings he concluded
BTS And so it is that my pride desires that you shall know my thinking is correct and right
BTS I sprang toward the rigging to which I might have clung and was met by the descending wall of water
BTS They made noises and at first he was frightened at them
BTS Shark ho sir
BTS It is your own empirical generalization and it is correct
BTS nor would they by paying for accident tempt the poor to hurt themselves in the machinery
BTS A return to the soil forsooth
BTS But father was not to be denied
BTS The blood from his nose gushed in a scarlet stream over the feet of the helmsman who was none other than Louis his boat-mate
BTS The right to buy and sell is clearly stated
BTS In a hundred segregated traps were the comrades thus held while the work of subjugating them went on
BTS few had found it
BTS Second the organizing of the Fighting Groups and outside of them of the general secret organization of the Revolution
BTS His two dogs stayed close by him one on either side leaning against him for protection crying and whimpering and at times snarling desperately when a wolf approached a little closer than usual
BTS As an enemy of his kind it was in White Fang's province to fight with them
BTS And as the oligarchs had done with the morning papers so had they done in a thousand other ways
BTS The stern of the vessel shot by dropping as it did so into a hollow between the waves
BTS Only this stream I gazed upon did not flow
BTS The hawk had eaten the ptarmigan-mother
BTS While I was considering the problem Wolf Larsen came on deck
BTS Each dog was fastened to the sled by a single rope
BTS Next to lower a boat
BTS and he learned much about the ways of moose-birds and woodpeckers
BTS He backed up Spitz with his whip while Buck backed up the remainder of the team
BTS The hard times of the preceding year had thrust great masses of the proletariat beneath the starvation line and the continued and wide-reaching disorder had but sunk them deeper
BTS We have nothing to do with that
BTS Van Weyden will pull him around as good as ever in three or four weeks
BTS I'd liked to have done for you first Hump
BTS At five in the morning Maud brought me hot coffee and biscuits she had baked and at seven a substantial and piping hot breakfast put new lift into me
BTS The good stands for all things that bring easement and satisfaction and surcease from pain
BTS The bravest and the most combative and self-sacrificing of our comrades went into the Fighting Groups
BTS Three days passed by which time Buck and his mates found how really tired and weak they were
BTS How do you know
BTS They were crowded with ragged unskilled laborers people of the abyss
BTS Three men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on grinning and winking at one another
BTS Denied help from his friends such as father and Ernest and I could have given he was left to battle for himself alone
BTS But since you say that you were voyaging to Japan for your health I can assure you that it will improve no better anywhere than aboard the Ghost
BTS Hartman and I had breakfast together in the dining car and I forced myself to eat
BTS It was at the cutting-up of a moose fresh-killed that White Fang learned of the changed relations in which he stood to the dog-world
BTS Henry shrugged his shoulders
BTS Our men clustering amidships waved their hats and raised a derisive cheer
BTS Thomas Mugridge turned a pitiable scared face
BTS Why had I brought the matter up
BTS But that has nothing to do with the legal aspects of the case
BTS Then in the first dog-watch trouble came to a head in the forecastle
BTS But why
BTS Grey Beaver clouted him right and left to make him get up and follow
BTS I was frightened
BTS I remember one beautiful day when the boats left early and the reports of the hunters' guns grew dim and distant and died away as they scattered far and wide over the sea
BTS So fierce had this final struggle become that the sailor paused in the act of flinging more water over him and stared curiously the canvas bucket partly tilted and dripping its contents to the deck
BTS There was a great snarling and yelping
BTS No for Brazil now has a surplus too
BTS Our eyes were not loath to meet
BTS And others were exasperated too and some were smiling in an amused and superior way
BTS His head must iv smashed like an eggshell
BTS Nevertheless he felt a little prick of ambition a sneaking desire to have another battle with that ptarmigan hen only the hawk had carried her away
BTS my woman my mate went ringing through my brain but now alas it was a knell that sounded
BTS This was a blunder on the part of the Oligarchy and a costly one
BTS The Congressional Record is here in Ardis and a reference to it shows mention of the bill on the following dates June 30 December 9 15 16 and 17 1902 and January 7 and 14 1903
BTS So he became the enemy of his kind domesticated wolves that they were softened by the fires of man weakened in the sheltering shadow of man's strength
BTS He crawled the several steps toward the flame
BTS Also he was learning to drive dogs and to train dogs
BTS And I was not
BTS When I had the boat empty again I was forced to take away the tarpaulin which covered Maud in order that I might lash it down across the bow
BTS At such times love was joy to him a wild keen-thrilling satisfaction
BTS Again what's it all about
BTS Through information furnished by its spies scores of our refuges were raided by the soldiers of the Iron Heel
BTS For all I knew it might have been four miles per hour instead of two
BTS He had wasted no time with his teeth
BTS As Kiche when with the wolves had lured out to destruction dogs from the camps of men so White Fang in manner somewhat similar lured Lip-lip into Kiche's avenging jaws
BTS I felt no fear though I was sure of death in that boiling surge amongst the rocks which was rapidly growing nearer
BTS CHAPTER VII THE BISHOP'S VISION The Bishop is out of hand Ernest wrote me
BTS They are plentifully distributed over this part of the ocean
BTS but he recovered himself almost in mid air and the circle sank down again and waited
BTS That business was a thing of the past
BTS This over he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him sniffing in half-friendly half-savage manner
BTS The United States was paralyzed
BTS had been his demand
BTS Wolf Larsen was too wise for that and besides they had no adequate weapons
BTS CHAPTER XVIII The next day while the storm was blowing itself out Wolf Larsen and I crammed anatomy and surgery and set Mugridge's ribs
BTS I'm going to try and resign and get into the army
BTS And there was a smell in the air of fish
BTS I wish I could convey to you the conception that is dimly forming in my own mind Ernest said
BTS Maud laughed at my crestfallen expression and I said As soon as the wind abates I intend going in the boat to explore the island
BTS The Gold Commissioner's a special pal of his
BTS He was quick to obey and I found myself alone on the deck of the Ghost
BTS but long years of bookish silence had made me inattentive and unprepared
BTS They made Sixty Mile which is a fifty-mile run on the first day
BTS This served to form a large roll in Cherokee's mouth the fur of which well-nigh defied his teeth
BTS There was no greeting
BTS It was bitter bloody work but we were fighting for life and for the Revolution and we had to fight the enemy with its own weapons
BTS He devoted all the years of his manhood to it and for it he gave his life
BTS Chapter I
BTS I know my own mind and what's best
BTS Your claws are trimmed
BTS Now watch me take Kelly's right oar Smoke said drawing a more careful aim
BTS I could scarcely catch my breath so fiercely was I impelled through the heavens
BTS Here
BTS The two men shook hands
BTS Their bristly fur was rimed with frost
BTS I knew not how and yet I had been looking directly at it
BTS Jordan has stated it very clearly Ernest said
BTS I demanded
BTS Buck threw himself forward tightening the traces with a jarring lunge
BTS Look 'ere 'Ump he began a malicious light in his eyes and a snarl in his throat
BTS The slop-chest as well as the provisions was stored in the lazarette and I took advantage of the opportunity to lay in a stock of underclothing
BTS And now we are no longer travelling toward Japan I answered
BTS He has a splendidly disciplined mind
BTS At last at the end of the fourth day he pulled the great moose down
BTS I sat down on the hatch-combing and rested my chin on my hands in black despair
BTS He bled freely but showed no signs of being disconcerted
BTS And at this moment Latimer called down the scuttles Hump
BTS But not one of them made love to me as Ernest did
BTS Van Weyden he said to me when he had been relieved from the wheel we must make these new-comers welcome
BTS We began with a particular industrial process the shoe factory
BTS but at the time it was the most natural thing in the world
BTS The next day White Fang's anxiety and restlessness were even more pronounced
BTS But these two affairs were only the opening events of the day's programme
BTS There he remained eight months at the end of which time for two reasons he was loath to leave us
BTS So there was no damming up the tide of life that was rising within him rising with every mouthful of meat he swallowed with every breath he drew
BTS while dolphin meat is served fore and aft on such occasions as Johnson catches the blazing beauties from the bowsprit end
BTS Wickson was imperturbable
BTS Next the favored unions withdrew from the international organizations and broke off all affiliations
BTS Van Weyden
BTS Kill myself
BTS The wolf started on toward the place from where the call surely came then returned to him sniffing noses and making actions as though to encourage him
BTS The mothers and children were put to work at the new machines
BTS The lips were full yet possessed of the firmness almost harshness which is characteristic of thin lips
BTS He'll learn soon enough
BTS We were not making more than nine knots but the fog-bank was very near
BTS If he has  I muttered savagely
BTS I know he hasn't I answered
BTS These men had been long in the country
BTS but never once did they succeed in reaching the city of the oligarchs over on the west side
BTS The lazarette where such delicacies were stored was situated beneath the cabin floor
BTS but my first impression or feel of the man was not of this but of his strength
BTS The bulkhead was too thick for us to hear what he said
BTS But you are not to be blamed for this
BTS This he received without perturbation though he obeyed it by keeping his distance
BTS It is so much more beautiful
BTS Something like that she confessed
BTS It was at this time that a diversion came to the spectators
BTS I expostulated you advance the fact that it is your ship as though it were a moral right
BTS With the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind till the train made another stop when he floundered past the sleds to his own where he stood alongside Sol-leks
BTS He refused to take into consideration what I was or rather what my life and the things I was accustomed to had been
BTS Henry Dallas the superintendent was a vulpine-faced creature who regarded me insolently and refused to talk
BTS But when the descending foot missed the solid flooring and felt vacancy beneath it was the old Wolf Larsen and the tiger muscles that made the falling body spring across the opening even as it fell so that he struck on his chest and stomach with arms outstretched on the floor of the opposite side
BTS I queried
BTS the saloon-keeper demanded
BTS But you called me the American Mrs
BTS He bristled with facts
BTS And this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897 when the Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North
BTS This had constituted the clay of him and it had not been kindly moulded by the world
BTS Next we went over a low oak-covered ridge and descended into a smaller meadow
BTS See 'em alterin' the course
BTS The front end of the sled was turned up like a scroll in order to force down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it
BTS then sight and sound of her faded away and we were alone on the dark sea
BTS while the adventures toward the far white wall ceased altogether
BTS Neither can I I said
BTS Buck was ravenous
BTS It is a very little world a mote a speck and I marvel that men should dare to venture the sea on a contrivance so small and fragile
BTS He was certainly a handsome man beautiful in the masculine sense
BTS I almost loved him then though I am confident had I never seen him again that the vague feelings would have passed away and that I should easily have forgotten him
BTS The trail they had broken into the country was packed hard by later journeyers
BTS Perhaps I suggested again
BTS And it won't be comfortable in the boat rowing and sailing in this rainy weather
BTS He became another man
BTS His voice was soft and soothing
BTS These women capable of the most sublime emotions of the tenderest sympathies were open-mouthed and screaming
BTS In the eyes of society it will truly be insanity he replied
BTS Then to what end
BTS An hour later Avis Everhard was no more
BTS In fact I had crammed navigation from text-books aboard
BTS While Johansen was summoning the watch below a couple of sailors under the captain's direction laid the canvas-swathed corpse upon a hatch-cover
BTS Pervaise was smuggled into one of the galleries ostensibly closed for repairs
BTS With the dogs falling Mercedes weeping and riding Hal swearing innocuously and Charles's eyes wistfully watering they staggered into John Thornton's camp at the mouth of White River
BTS Six cents lady she said nodding her head gently while she went on stitching
BTS I ran my eyes over them twenty men all told
BTS Inside the cabin the two men had just gone to bed
BTS He was preeminently cunning and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive
BTS This life only you are certain is real
BTS But the question is How do they club them
BTS He snapped his fingers contemptuously and proceeded to sit down
BTS So it was that White Fang's method when he took the offensive was first to find a young dog alone
BTS Let each one of you who is prosperous take into his house some thief and treat him as his brother some unfortunate and treat her as his sister and San Francisco will need no police force and no magistrates
BTS The very thing
BTS There it stands on its two hind-legs club in hand immensely potential passionate and wrathful and loving god and mystery and power all wrapped up and around by flesh that bleeds when it is torn and that is good to eat like any flesh
BTS You will have to speak louder
BTS I'll write to you about him
BTS CHAPTER XIX TRANSFORMATION You must make yourself over again Ernest wrote to me
BTS His walk was actually tottery as he came down the port side of the cabin
BTS It is so short-sighted on the part of the workingmen
BTS Wolf Larsen cried and the hunter dropped it as though it were hot and had burned him
BTS Mr
BTS In the end he worked out the complete law
BTS In fact so terrible did we make ourselves that it became a greater peril to betray us than to remain loyal to us
BTS We've had a hard time a hard time
BTS CHAPTER XXXVII At once we moved aboard the Ghost occupying our old state-rooms and cooking in the galley
BTS It killed her and she was the fastest worker in the shop
BTS But he shook my hand off with an irritated movement and for a long time I stood by his side in silence
BTS He must be nursed as you would nurse a human being a sick child
BTS I believed my eyes without question and yet I was for the moment stunned by what they disclosed to me
BTS And as I picked myself up and started on I looked into the face of the thing and saw that it still lived
BTS He did not change his position either but continued to gaze down with a great curiosity
BTS Maybe it's a Russian suggested Latimer
BTS Then again came the prod of his instinct and the warning of past experience
BTS It required much thinking and endless patience on the part of Weedon Scott to accomplish this
BTS It's nasty weather like this here that turns heads grey before their time he said with a nod toward the pilot-house
BTS The sooner you get accustomed to it the better he said
BTS That Wolf Larsen had turned the liquor loose among his men surprised me but he evidently knew their psychology and the best method of cementing in cordiality what had begun in bloodshed
BTS What else are they
BTS White Fang's natural impulse when he saw the live food fluttering about him and under his very nose was to spring upon it
BTS As he said Up above me I knew were unselfishnesses of the spirit clean and noble thinking keen intellectual living
BTS The next moment the two mothers separated and before they rushed together again the lynx lashed out at the cub with a huge fore-paw that ripped his shoulder open to the bone and sent him hurtling sidewise against the wall
BTS Responsibility of this sort was a new thing to me
BTS Try to find out and you get a bomb on your head
BTS The Canadian Government would be no loser nor would its despatches travel the slower
BTS The building of these great works and cities will give a starvation ration to millions of common laborers for the enormous bulk of the surplus will compel an equally enormous expenditure and the oligarchs will build for a thousand years--ay for ten thousand years
BTS The sound arose from his great lungs and dominated the human tempest
BTS How can he be tempted to get drunk and refuse to get drunk
BTS The next moment the master arrived and with one hand held White Fang while the father called off the dogs
BTS It must come right it must come right I repeated to myself over and over again
BTS I spoke of the professional men and the artists as villeins
BTS Yes sir the mate acknowledged submissively
BTS From wincing he went to whimpering
BTS Henry grunted and crawled into bed
BTS He paused and we waited
BTS You would go into the militia yourself was Ernest's retort and be sent to Maine or Florida or the Philippines or anywhere else to drown in blood your own comrades civil-warring for their liberties
BTS You make small-capitalist political speeches such as Mr
BTS How did you guess
BTS But after that he was afraid no more of the looming bulks of the tepees
BTS He counted them with care and then joined his partner in cursing the power of the Wild that had robbed them of another dog
BTS His transient masters since he had come into the Northland had bred in him a fear that no master could be permanent
BTS I attended to making the boat secure and joined her
BTS The throat-halyards which I had rigged were cut across through every part
BTS It was like the trap and all his instinct resented it and revolted against it
BTS Two minutes from the time Curly went down the last of her assailants were clubbed off
BTS Faith
BTS You ain't going to take him out now
BTS This mob had risen up out of the earth apparently and to all intents and purposes its work done it had gone back into the earth
BTS The master's wife called him the Blessed Wolf which name was taken up with acclaim and all the women called him the Blessed Wolf
BTS Matt was rolling the master's blankets and fur robe inside a small tarpaulin
BTS It is impossible absurd
BTS Not that he was a mere soap-box orator
BTS They got Bill an' they may get me but they'll sure never get you young man he said addressing the dead body in its tree-sepulchre
BTS To keep one's feet in the midst of the hostile mass meant life and this he learnt well
BTS But she only snarled at him and he walked out alone into the bright sunshine to find the snow-surface soft under foot and the travelling difficult
BTS He looked upon our catastrophe in the light of an adventure
BTS There were great stables where a dozen grooms and boys held forth rows of vine-clad servants' cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses long grape arbors green pastures orchards and berry patches
BTS Then blisters came in a painful and never-ending procession and I had a great burn on my forearm acquired by losing my balance in a roll of the ship and pitching against the galley stove
BTS So I was in the army
BTS The latter were afraid of him while he merely refrained from attacking them
BTS Ben with the wolves all that time
BTS I am paralysed
BTS White Fang waited an hour
BTS Thomas Mugridge is becoming unendurable
BTS I was in some building that was locked in combat with some other building
BTS I do not understand I said
BTS Don't you see there in the stern-sheets on the bottom
BTS But think of the coffee
BTS He did not relish my joke
BTS A call from the mate interrupted the gory narrative and Harrison went aft
BTS I'd like to see how it works
BTS It was distasteful to his instinct
BTS I was frightened when I became conscious that I was seeing red and the thought flashed through my mind was I too becoming tainted by the brutality of my environment
BTS You have failed in your management
BTS It is an empty shell and soon even the empty shell will be taken away from you
BTS But the Cockney had not pursued me
BTS It's me and Johnson have to face the music
BTS I'm agreein' with you the dog-musher answered and Weedon Scott was not quite sure whether or not the other had snickered
BTS He turned to the other men who were anxious to speak
BTS But One Ear broke into a run across the snow his traces trailing behind him
BTS I'm repairing her was my answer
BTS At once he heard and answered her and at once she came to me
BTS She answered with a grateful little smile that sent my heart pounding and started to descend the companion-stairs
BTS It is a question neither of grammar nor ethics but of fact
BTS Ain't run out
BTS The farmers were in the net
BTS Now to begin again
BTS And Jackson had a wife and two children dependent on him
BTS He called it a tonic
BTS By convulsive efforts he got on his feet staggered and fell
BTS What of my new-found love I was a giant
BTS Calvin paused a moment
BTS Then get out of the way was the reply and don't bother me
BTS but I could have sworn there was a note of disappointment in her voice
BTS Humphrey Van Weyden she concluded
BTS They had hair instead of fur and a few had very little hair at that
BTS Master and owner of a ship at the top of my life as you say when I am beginning to diminish and die
BTS I took him through the homes of a few of our factory workers
BTS Hal did the talking
BTS Again he shook his head sadly
BTS In fact I had known life only in its intellectual phases
BTS The latter had remembered the general strike and had guarded against the defection of the telegraphers by installing wireless stations in the control of the Mercenaries
BTS And so I caught myself standing idly and studying him
BTS We all understand them
BTS Then all fight fled out of him
BTS Matt loosened the bandana from his own neck and started to put it around White Fang's
BTS But the fresh meat was strong in Baseek's nostrils and greed urged him to take a bite of it
BTS He halted with awkward abruptness with stiff fore-legs bracing himself against his momentum almost sitting down on his haunches so desirous was he of avoiding contact with the dog he was in the act of attacking
BTS the man asked after the customary Ay ay sir
BTS White Fang ceased only when he had tired himself out
BTS With a large business there is always less waste and greater efficiency
BTS To complete the deception an extra plate was laid and when we sat down to table one chair was not occupied
BTS He had a way of taking Buck's head roughly between his hands and resting his own head upon Buck's of shaking him back and forth the while calling him ill names that to Buck were love names
BTS Dr
BTS One Eye caught sight of a dim movement of white in the midst of the white
BTS What do you intend doing with Leach and Johnson
BTS He yelped in his fright
BTS In a dozen states the revolt flared up
BTS I'm so sorry she said
BTS The wind freshened in the afternoon raising a stiffer sea and trying the boat and me severely
BTS Furthermore he was sleepy
BTS Next day Johansen the new mate was routed from the cabin by Wolf Larsen and sent into the steerage to sleep thereafter while I took possession of the tiny cabin state-room which on the first day of the voyage had already had two occupants
BTS He rose high under the rule of the Iron Heel and finally was translated into the oligarch class
BTS The small capitalists who were in these thousands of enterprises are gone
BTS The wolves swung in behind yelping in chorus
BTS Nor did he know the desperateness of her deed
BTS White Fang followed sliding over the ground in wolf fashion and with wolf speed swiftly and without noise and in the centre of the field he dragged down and slew the dog
BTS One sled he drove himself drawn by dogs he had traded for or borrowed
BTS My father and mother were Danes and how they ever came to that bleak bight of land on the west coast I do not know
BTS There were no more animals with which to fight at least there was none considered worthy of fighting with him
BTS She herself was an executioner for the Fighting Groups and known as the Red Virgin she became one of the inspired figures of the Revolution
BTS With the power that is yours you might have risen to any height
BTS Besides it was a position of such utter helplessness that White Fang's whole nature revolted against it
BTS One Eye moved impatiently beside her
BTS To add to my wretchedness a splitting headache was coming on and I was only too glad to close my eyes and try to sleep
BTS or did they
BTS Then I gave Maud careful instructions for lowering away and went into the hold to the step on the schooner's bottom
BTS A bright thought struck me
BTS For three days this blinding headache lasted and he suffered as wild animals suffer as it seemed the way on ship to suffer without plaint without sympathy utterly alone
BTS Leave me alone till morning
BTS Every little while some one or another of you is so discharged
BTS Developed himself by peeling potatoes and washing dishes
BTS Before his earnestness conventional maiden dignity was ridiculous
BTS He spoke in a far-away manner of his illness and we talked disjointedly about the church the alterations in the organ and about petty charities
BTS As a preliminary to another journey to his bunk he hooked Wolf Larsen's buttonhole with a greasy forefinger and vacuously proclaimed and reiterated I got money I got money I tell yer an' I'm a gentleman's son
BTS It was Spitz treacherously attacking from the side
BTS You mean
BTS Though he did not know it by the weight of his body he clogged the action of the leg and thereby saved his mother much damage
BTS About what
BTS There were fierce fighters among them but three battles with the fiercest brought Buck to mastery so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got out of his way
BTS Each man felt that he had been robbed
BTS White Fang made several ineffectual efforts to get up
BTS Mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs being too occupied with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and brother
BTS I just thought you might want to register a kick
BTS He would bark and dance about in front of the bull just out of reach of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have stamped his life out with a single blow
BTS Buck seized Thornton's hand in his teeth
BTS They lived like beasts in great squalid labor-ghettos festering in misery and degradation
BTS I caught sight of him toiling at the main-sheet heaving it in and flat with his tremendous muscles the stern of the schooner lifted high in the air and his body outlined against a white surge of sea sweeping past
BTS It's the only thing to do
BTS He dodged this way and that and curved and turned but to no purpose
BTS It seemed a mite top-heavy
BTS You know how he leaped across the opening of the lazarette
BTS Why nothing else than put the masts back into the Ghost and sail away
BTS The young fellow seemed to have recovered his composure for he answered steadily enough I don't know sir
BTS Our failure so to report would be excused we knew in the light of subsequent events
BTS but the size and fierce aspect of the intruder did not deter him
BTS while Arthur Simpson referred to in the Manuscript as being ill of typhoid fever at the time of the explosion received only fifteen years
BTS The wind was fair but fitful and it was like looking for a needle in a haystack to raise that tiny boat out of the blue immensity
BTS All I get is fifty for it he grumbled
BTS Had the windlass been in order it would not have been so difficult
BTS There was another soldier there a young man too
BTS Those dear tired eyes
BTS Beauty Smith's eyes lighted up at this and he licked his thin lips with an eager tongue
BTS The time was yet to come for independence
BTS The she-wolf knew why One Eye never came back but there was no way by which she could tell what she had seen to the grey cub
BTS It is a tale of blood
BTS It is true that you have read history aright
BTS He was but two paces behind when I tumbled into the boat and as I shoved off with an oar his teeth crunched down upon the blade
BTS It is our lives against theirs
BTS It filled him with a great unrest and strange desires
BTS Square fitted into square
BTS So did Mit-sah and Kloo-kooch
BTS And at the same time were arrested all socialist Congressmen in Washington including the unfortunate Simpson who lay ill with typhoid fever in his hotel
BTS The fin disappeared
BTS Gentlemen there stands the bear he pointed at Ernest and your buzzing has only tickled his ears
BTS The confined space was filled with shrieks and yells and curses
BTS He economised
BTS His eyes were large and between them was the distance of two eyes
BTS So once again I softly kissed her hair as I felt her receding from my clasp
BTS Tears were in Maud's eyes and I do believe they were for me
BTS And when at last he was dragged shrieking away I sank down fainting upon the floor
BTS I heard Wolf Larsen mutter half to himself half to them as though they could hear
BTS For we lived on the heights where the air was keen and sparkling where the toil was for humanity and where sordidness and selfishness never entered
BTS In San Francisco we did not know what was happening even across the bay in Oakland or Berkeley
BTS When I was a boy father said I was very curious
BTS What is to become of the other unions
BTS For that matter my percentages are mild
BTS And I can tell you that my life is pretty valuable just now to myself
BTS As I passed him I shot a keen look at his face
BTS And so it came that he learned there were gods and gods
BTS God was more powerful as he said Whom thunder hath made greater
BTS He had learned much
BTS Then there was a woman who charged from a heap snarling and shooting
BTS Never in all his fighting had this thing happened
BTS From below as from out an abyss of blackness came up a gurgling sound as of air bubbling through water
BTS I need scarcely say that I was deeply interested in Ernest Everhard
BTS Because he's comin'
BTS But Maud's hand leaped out restrainingly to mine
BTS They jes' swallowed 'm alive
BTS Oh was all she replied
BTS and the five men lined the lee rail guns in hand and waited
BTS He called Hans and Pete to him
BTS What he might have done I did not fully realize till next day when he put his head into the galley and as a sign of renewed friendliness asked me how my arm was getting on
BTS The Ghost's stumpy masts were in place her crazy sails bent
BTS There is no discussion of this
BTS and now and again as we drew closer we could see the bullets zip-zipping from wave to wave
BTS That is the meaning of the capitalist system
BTS She no longer considered the dogs and because she was sore and tired she persisted in riding on the sled
BTS I raced aft putting the wheel up
BTS Shrinking almost shivering he still managed to hold himself together
BTS He was a killer
BTS Van Weyden there accustomed to having things done for you
BTS It came from the things that lived and moved again things which had been as dead and which had not moved during the long months of frost
BTS The dogs that still lived looked on and understood
BTS Perrault grinned
BTS A soldier leaped from it carrying something carefully in his hands
BTS also criminals
BTS Let me show you
BTS Thus it was with the two children
BTS In half a day I got the two topmasts aboard and the shears rigged and guyed as before
BTS he had fought
BTS In the crew of the fishing boat that conveyed them across San Pablo Bay was a spy
BTS Behind them came the soldiers with their automatic rifles
BTS It still regarded them with the merciless wistfulness of hunger
BTS And if the Master's work leads there so be it
BTS No matter how much squabbling takes place in one percentage or another the division is arranged
BTS One of the puppies sprawled up to White Fang
BTS You must cease to be
BTS The third day we spent in the building and on the fourth Ernest having got permission and an automobile from the authorities we left Chicago
BTS Each moment one or the other of us cast expectant glances toward the Ghost
BTS When he overtook White Fang he reached down and by the nape of the neck lifted him clear of the water
BTS The envy is an intellectual product
BTS Wolf Larsen had little to say at first doing no more than reply when he was addressed
BTS We shivered miserably throughout the night
BTS Sol-leks was limping and Dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder-blade
BTS but Perrault to make up lost time pushed them late and early
BTS Yet one habit remained to him from the old life
BTS His only apparent ambition like Dave's was to be left alone
BTS A rain-squall drove past and out of the flying wet the boat emerged almost upon us
BTS and third to drive in with his teeth at the soft throat
BTS We are in the right and it must come right
BTS He learned to sneak about camp to be crafty to know what was going on everywhere to see and to hear everything and to reason accordingly and successfully to devise ways and means of avoiding his implacable persecutor
BTS yet he retained his wildness and wiliness
BTS What is your way out
BTS I know men club them I said trying to reassure myself and gazing doubtfully at a large bull not thirty feet away upreared on his fore-flippers and regarding me intently
BTS At first amid the applause of the gods he betrayed a trifle of his old self-consciousness and awkwardness
BTS For Latimer having finally gone for a lantern held it so that its light shone down the scuttle
BTS I do believe that wolf's on to you the dog-musher said
BTS she cried
BTS One Eye was desperate
BTS My function is to amuse and so long as I amuse all goes well
BTS but under the dominion of man it is sometimes even shorter
BTS And they were proud too
BTS The Iron Heel could offer money leisure the joys and pleasures that waited in the repose of the wonder cities
BTS He was oppressed with a sense of calamity happening if it were not calamity already happened
BTS A man more courageous than ethical and of undeniable ability
BTS I have made the acquaintance of another one of the crew Louis he is called a rotund and jovial-faced Nova Scotia Irishman and a very sociable fellow prone to talk as long as he can find a listener
BTS And why not
BTS Your stomach's sour that's what's botherin' you
BTS you get nowhere
BTS My heart
BTS He prowled about the cabin while the sled-dogs slept and the first night-visitor to the cabin fought him off with a club until Weedon Scott came to the rescue
BTS The lecturers were usually though not always hired
BTS Judge Scott surveyed them triumphantly
BTS Maud tried to reply but could not speak
BTS All about me was the same movement
BTS I returned to my hut for the shot-gun made sure it was loaded and went down to the Ghost
BTS And you you ain't never fed 'm after them first days of gettin' acquainted
BTS If he wasn't great would he have charge of the law business of the Sierra Mills of the Erston Land Syndicate of the Berkeley Consolidated of the Oakland San Leandro and Pleasanton Electric
BTS They were shaking and prodding him into consciousness
BTS But the wolf fled at sight of him
BTS The sailors must have learned whatever project was on hand and the vim and snap they put into their work attested their enthusiasm
BTS He was at high nervous tension and in his eyes there was unspeakable horror
BTS We were now alongside and foaming past
BTS Maud took an active part in the drive and with her cries and flourishings of the broken oar was of considerable assistance
BTS And responsive out of his deeps had come the new thing love
BTS They were good to eat
BTS I came back to the bag afterward an' got 'm his fish
BTS commented Judge Scott
BTS This gentleman who collected fine editions and was a patron of literature paid blackmail to a heavy-jowled black-browed boss of a municipal machine
BTS His face wore an absent expression as of deep thought and I became afraid that if his eyes did light upon me he would nevertheless not see me
BTS And even as they eased him down upon the blankets his snores were rising on the frosty air
BTS In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep
BTS Powerful influences must have been brought to bear hence its suppression
BTS He had never learned to play with them
BTS This would always culminate with the master's arms going around White Fang's neck and shoulders while the latter crooned and growled his love-song
BTS Wouldn't it be better if you went forward say by the steerage companion-way until it is over
BTS was her next query
BTS At the fort Beauty Smith left him securely tied and went in to bed
BTS Will you please signal it then so that I may be put ashore
BTS Let the abysmal brute roar and the police and Mercenaries slay
BTS Remember he said in a voice that made itself heard above the din that as you show mercy now to the proletariat some day will that same proletariat show mercy to you
BTS In that moment White Fang's free nature flashed forth again and he sank his teeth into the moccasined foot
BTS Therein lies the difference
BTS Six lonely months I spent in the refuge but they were not idle months
BTS He's no fool
BTS I strove vainly to force my fingers down on the triggers and vainly I strove to say something
BTS The soldiers were cooking their breakfasts over fires built on the ground beside the track and they looked up curiously at us as we thundered past without slackening our terrific speed
BTS He was lying on his left side at the time and in evident pain
BTS For Johnson and Leach the travail of existence had ceased
BTS Not a drop of liquor passed his lips
BTS cried Mr
BTS Maud Brewster had stepped inside the companion-way so that only her head was exposed
BTS It couldn't have been better planned though the two comrades in it sacrificed their lives
BTS so that he was glad to go back to his revolutionists who were clean noble and alive and all that the capitalists were not
BTS He dared not risk a fight with this young lightning-flash and again he knew and more bitterly the enfeeblement of oncoming age
BTS What if I should cry out loudly
BTS The struggle with Japan and the rest of Asia for India was merely delayed
BTS White Fang near the corner of the cabin and forty feet away was snarling with blood-curdling viciousness not at Scott but at the dog-musher
BTS 'Bout time you come growled the god of the car an hour later when Weedon Scott appeared at the door
BTS This dog was thrashing about in a death-struggle directly on the trail and Buck passed around him without stopping
BTS But we've got to do something
BTS He was exhibited as the Fighting Wolf and men paid fifty cents in gold dust to see him
BTS White Fang was very wise
BTS And still step by step with long intervals between the mass ascended
BTS He was challenging my manhood with his slurs challenging the very legs he claimed to be instrumental in getting for me
BTS This foreshadowing of a slow social evolution was made when Ernest was first depressed by the defection of the great unions
BTS Come in and be fat was their proposition or stay out and starve
BTS His chin fell forward on his chest
BTS The Grangers have come over to us the farmers the middle class and the laborers
BTS He looked at the house as if debating whether or not he should come in and try to sell some of his wares
BTS A wolf-mother was not made to remember her cubs of a year or so before
BTS The sled held as though it were an anchor
BTS I waved my hand back and forth of course without effect
BTS How can they hope to keep our sympathy-- When we are compelled to walk Ernest said slyly
BTS Believe me the working class will continue to do without you
BTS I won't 'it yer
BTS D'ye hear it squeal
BTS Father was silent for a few minutes
BTS I queried
BTS When she rushed at him he turned his fur-protected shoulder to her sharp teeth and walked away stiff-legged and stately
BTS At ten years of age he had gone to work in the mills and later he served his apprenticeship and became a horseshoer
BTS My university life and study and culture had not been real
BTS Did you fall under temptation
BTS And what we learn of this will serve us with everything else we have to hoist aboard
BTS What was he
BTS Very few people knew of the existence of this law
BTS Here goes
BTS To cap it all Wickson's hunting lodge was a quarter of a mile from my hiding-place
BTS He outlined the evidence I was to give
BTS He regarded her carefully and dubiously yet desirefully
BTS There is no more horrible page in history than the treatment of the child and women slaves in the English factories in the latter half of the eighteenth century of the Christian Era
BTS It was most amusing
BTS In this they were favored by the oligarchs
BTS It's more a feeling on my part than anything else
BTS If ever Wolf Larsen attained the summit of living he attained it then
BTS To himself
BTS And here in the Klondike the leader was indeed the leader
BTS And Ernest was not pleasant to look at
BTS His eyes were yellow and muddy as though Nature had run short on pigments and squeezed together the dregs of all her tubes
BTS The fact is that you have the money
BTS I see the fear of death in your eyes
BTS Canned goods were turned out that made men laugh for canned goods on the Long Trail is a thing to dream about
BTS An age of selfishness was dawning upon mankind
BTS But he had pride
BTS But it was not his whim
BTS Without shame I confess that it was I who turned and footed it
BTS For ten minutes I had watched her talking earnestly with the engineer and now with a sign for silence I drew her out of earshot of the helmsman
BTS And stand by to back over the jibs
BTS Why not
BTS The rest of his mates though lighter dogs had relatively lost more weight than he
BTS You will find them all slaves of the machine
BTS Also he saw one dog that would neither conciliate nor obey finally killed in the struggle for mastery
BTS There the revolutionary spirit was strong
BTS I hope it will not be too dreadful a hardship for you to make yourself a dress or two
BTS While the arch-oligarchs were no more than a handful there were myriads of lesser ones of the type say of Mr
BTS Calvin swallowed
BTS The old system of labor was broken down
BTS So he was driven to hunt still smaller things
BTS So saying he turned and walked quietly forward
BTS His bondage had softened him
BTS Once their uproar became so loud that Bill woke up
BTS Not content with this he fetched a second chest and placed it on top of the first
BTS Yes I mean just that I replied
BTS Of course there is the large likelihood that the proletariat will take it away first
BTS The present with all its perils and anxieties rushed upon me with stunning force
BTS It was colossal stunning
BTS They were always crawling and sprawling toward it and being driven back from it by their mother
BTS The cub found no more milk in his mother's breast nor did he get one mouthful of meat for himself
BTS I saw his hand miss the door-knob by an inch quickly fumble for it and find it
BTS As she arrived at right angles to the sea the full force of the wind from which we had hitherto run away caught us
BTS And it was he who increased the pace when he sighted the she-wolf now trotting slowly across the snow
BTS He snarled and bristled and flattened his ears
BTS Wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh they were countered by the fangs of Spitz
BTS But the situation of the pack was desperate
BTS The snap had taken effect on the shoulder that had been hurt by the lynx and that was still sore deep down near the bone
BTS It was as a cue to him seeming to rouse him to do what he would never have dreamed of doing
BTS His brutal materialism will not permit it
BTS He was the perfect expositor
BTS His mind was fresh and plastic and by nature he was very ethical
BTS The working class has done without you
BTS Where will your strength be then
BTS Far away in the south-west I could see a dark line on the water which grew even as I looked at it
BTS And tell Johnson to douse him with a few buckets of salt water he added in a lower tone for my ear alone
BTS He accounted for the existence of the million and a half of revolutionists in the United States by charging the capitalist class with having mismanaged society
BTS Who feeds you
BTS He couldn't work if it weren't for capital the Bishop interrupted
BTS I had looked upon it as a simple task what of the oars mast boom and sprit to say nothing of plenty of lines
BTS I could not play the coward before her eyes
BTS You'd have a dead Dick inside one minute two minutes at the farthest
BTS How did he get away
BTS Here the squaws came to his aid and White Fang transformed into a raging demon was finally driven off only by a fusillade of stones
BTS His jaws closed together
BTS A business man who was also a biologist and a sociologist would know approximately the right thing to do for humanity
BTS The way was clear
BTS I want to ask you some questions
BTS Picture it to yourself a man of ordinary stature slender of build and with weak undeveloped muscles who has lived a peaceful placid life and is unused to violence of any sort what could such a man possibly do
BTS yet beyond weird and haunting fragments of his verse quoted in the writings of others nothing of his has come down to us
BTS I don't count
BTS Insolence
BTS but since imprisonment proved no bar to our activities it was decided to avoid anything premature
BTS But she laughed weakly and her head drooped again
BTS and when he as a matter of course entered it both Perrault and Francois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils till he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold
BTS Chapter VI
BTS and he saw Francois swinging an axe spring into the mess of dogs
BTS It made him frantic this clinging dragging weight
BTS The hair of this man was long and matted and his head slanted back under it from the eyes
BTS As it is not one of them is married
BTS For three days Perrault and Francois threw chests up and down the main street of Skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink while the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of dog-busters and mushers
BTS There ain't a child at the spindles but what would curse me name
BTS One reason for this is that Wolf Larsen seems to have taken a fancy to him
BTS but to be taken as a joke by others was a different matter
BTS They are Jesuitical
BTS and the tiredness would pass out of his eyes and into them would flood the happy love-light that was in itself a new and sufficient advertisement of his immortality
BTS I would sacrifice nothing for them
BTS Countless attempts were made upon his life but he seemed to bear a charmed existence
BTS but he whispered in his ear
BTS The wolves were now more open in their pursuit trotting sedately behind and ranging along on either side their red tongues lolling out their lean sides showing the undulating ribs with every movement
BTS And this message it shall be the duty of the Church to deliver
BTS Calhoun said A power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves consisting of many and various and powerful interests combined into one mass and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks
BTS It was from them that the great bellowing went up
BTS They were superior creatures of a verity gods
BTS Say Henry that other one that come in an' got a fish why didn't the dogs pitch into it
BTS Henry judged his case to be hopeless
BTS Kill me
BTS '  God strike me dead 'Ump if that ayn't wot 'e sez an' me a-sittin' there in 'is own cabin jolly-like an' comfortable a-smokin' 'is cigars an' drinkin' 'is rum
BTS Then as ever after his strength appealed to me
BTS After that he recoiled from hurt because he knew that it was hurt
BTS One and all you tell the same story--the passing away of competition and the coming on of combination
BTS The sail flapped and fluttered and the boat paid off
BTS No matter what destruction was wreaked in the heart of the city they and their womenkind and children were to escape hurt
BTS As the sounds of the ship thrusting herself through the waves were hurled back upon us by the fog so were one's thoughts
BTS and in fact was the backbone of the town giving employment to hundreds of men and women
BTS He hid his head between his paws and yelped
BTS Besides time and place were not meet and I wished to earn a better right to declare my love
BTS and in that moment having stepped forward quite close to him I received my first impression of the man himself of the man as apart from his body and from the torrent of blasphemy I had heard him spew forth
BTS As I passed to leeward of the galley on my way aft I was approached by the engineer we had rescued
BTS I was proud that it did mean something to me and for the first time in a weary while I was convincingly conscious of a superiority over him
BTS How can we hope for solidarity with all these cross purposes and conflicts
BTS Also to be reckoned with was the immediateness of his attack
BTS but she had other troubles
BTS White Fang watched the performance with increasing anxiety until he could contain himself no longer when he sprang in front of the horse and barked savagely and warningly
BTS I was unfortunately and ignorantly facing it
BTS Like giants they toiled days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped the treasure up
BTS This tirade against destiny went on for an hour or more and then he buckled to his work limping and groaning and in his eyes a great hatred for all created things
BTS It had managed to roll up in a ball again but it was not quite the old compact ball
BTS The younger man's excitement and apprehension for White Fang was growing
BTS While Wolf Larsen held his wrist he stirred uneasily bowing his body so that for a moment it rested on shoulders and heels
BTS but honestly I'd rather stay
BTS and in this White Fang grew wise with them
BTS Talk about your rough-houses Matt murmured gleefully standing in the doorway and looking on
BTS Well
BTS Running behind the carriage in the outskirts of San Jose he encountered certain small boys who made a practice of flinging stones at him
BTS Then a huge dog was thrust inside and the door was slammed shut behind him
BTS Subjugation meant death for no quarter was given and they fought heroically to the last man
BTS But at the end of half an hour he arose growled wrathfully at the motionless ball and trotted on
BTS My mission had been to testify to his identity and loyalty
BTS Please please she pleaded and she disarmed me by the words as I was to discover they would ever disarm me
BTS Where is the trouble you were so sure was breezing up Captain Larsen
BTS She had stepped out beside me and I regarded her with wonderment
BTS I thought I saw for an instant the boat's bottom show black in a breaking crest
BTS The mate Johansen stood away several feet to the side of him and fully three yards in front of him sat Wolf Larsen on one of the pivotal cabin chairs
BTS And I heard also the sound of oars
BTS Sorry the domination of Aristotle's thought
BTS I had burst open the ends of my fingers at the very first and during the reefing I had worked with tears of pain running down my cheeks
BTS I'm not saying anything O'Connor replied except that I'm president of the Machinists' Association and it's my business to consider the interests of the men I represent that's all
BTS Candidly I do not know I strove to reassure her
BTS My mind itself was shocked
BTS I know the w'y I do to myke myself uppreci-yted
BTS As Wolf Larsen bent down to the lower bunk to take Johnson's pulse I standing erect and holding the lamp saw Leach's head rise stealthily as he peered over the side of his bunk to see what was going on
BTS He ignored her existence whenever it was possible and made it a point to keep out of her way
BTS But the blow did not fall
BTS But I was learning I was learning
BTS She nodded her head determinedly
BTS Maud released the hand
BTS The next moment a young man with a final slide down the crumbling wall alighted at my feet
BTS One wolf long and lean and gray advanced cautiously in a friendly manner and Buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night and a day
BTS Many months had gone by since he passed into the possession of Beauty Smith and in all that period he had never known a moment of freedom except at the times he had been loosed to fight with other dogs
BTS His face strove to compose itself writhing and twisting in the effort till he broke down again
BTS And like a true Indian he settled down to trade carefully and slowly even if it took all summer and the rest of the winter to dispose of his goods
BTS Oh shut up
BTS It is good discipline
BTS It was poor taste on my part and very inconsiderate
BTS In a little while One Eye noticed that the quills were drooping and that a great quivering had set up
BTS All other animals lived in the Wild and were when not too formidable lawful spoil for any dog
BTS The coal at his feet dragged him down
BTS If a chemist in New York made a new discovery in say radium all his expenses across the continent were paid and as well he received a princely fee for his time
BTS 'Who steals my purse steals trash' she quoted
BTS In our loins are the possibilities of millions of lives
BTS Before the day was out White Fang was to learn more about this law
BTS He was in an iron tomb buried alive
BTS You on the inside were caught napping this time he said
BTS On the other hand the unanimous affirmative answer will be that the return to nature and socialism are diametrically opposed to each other
BTS But watch your footing
BTS Now give me a growl the last good good-bye growl
BTS I stand convicted
BTS But Lip-lip was no longer leader except when he fled away before his mates at the end of his rope the sled bounding along behind
BTS These men here shoot seals in order to live
BTS He intended it for our comrades but he didn't give it enough time
BTS Three oilers and a fourth engineer was his greeting
BTS No one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard on what Buck imagined was merely a stroll
BTS I cut out the race and the children
BTS Hammerfield cried
BTS A derrick-boom rigged to the foremast had accomplished this
BTS Once out of the harness and down he did not get on his feet again till harness-up time in the morning
BTS into real estate into skyscrapers and residences and hotels and business blocks
BTS We have no food no water no blankets nothing
BTS He had the mind and the soul that only great men have
BTS Denied the outlet through play of his energies he recoiled upon himself and developed his mental processes
BTS At the best that was all
BTS she asked and I knew she had guessed aright
BTS But it was the multiplicity of laws that befuddled White Fang and often brought him into disgrace
BTS the organization with all its ramifications of our spy system
BTS We have put mammon in the place of Christ
BTS And I give you warning Wolf Larsen that I may forget love of my own life in the desire to kill you if you go too far in maltreating those poor wretches
BTS I was aware of a faintly perceptible shrinking on the part of the listeners before this figure of revolution concrete potential and menacing
BTS As I have said in the masculine sense his was a beautiful face
BTS These favours aroused in them jealousy and hatred
BTS It is only an intuition and so far I have failed to find the slightest clew
BTS And just then he gave a snort and a snarl and rushed at me
BTS While people starved lap-dogs were waited upon by maids
BTS I have sewed all my life in the old country and here in San Francisco--thirty-three years
BTS It was bewildering
BTS It will always be to me a monstrous inconceivable thing a horrible nightmare
BTS There was something heroic about this gently-bred woman enduring our terrible hardship and with her pittance of strength bending to the tasks of a peasant woman
BTS The man laughed at this
BTS It was the very thing the Oligarchy had played for--the destruction of its great rival in the world-market
BTS He resembled a man on the verge of a fit
BTS There it was the question flat
BTS while the reproving nudge of her nose gave place to the slash of her fangs
BTS I wish I had thought to bring Wolf Larsen's chronometer and sextant I said still gloomily
BTS I repeat my daughter that young man of yours is a very remarkable young man
BTS In his own way he had told the truth when he said all were dead
BTS They had hurt only the flesh of him
BTS The Blessed Wolf
BTS Stands pretty close to two feet an' a half at the shoulders Henry commented
BTS All this and more I have learned
BTS White Fang snarling fiercely scrambled backward for several yards while Matt stooped and investigated his leg
BTS he asked so innocently that Wolf Larsen was disconcerted while the others smiled
BTS I tell you yes
BTS Of course you can't buy meat
BTS They were in a wretched state worn out and worn down
BTS Weedon Scott bent over removed the arm and turned the man's face upward
BTS Then there was the militia
BTS One Eye moved slightly and peered forth with increased eagerness
BTS What he was about to say what terrible castigation he was going to give me I never knew
BTS The Great Earthquake of 1906 A
BTS I am giving these details so that the size of this little floating world which holds twenty-two men may be appreciated
BTS With the first slash Baseek's right ear was ripped into ribbons
BTS I glanced around to see that no one was within hearing distance
BTS That night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping
BTS I watched him build the fire and set about cooking food for himself
BTS Calvin said to Ernest
BTS Here was first considered the stand the socialists were to take
BTS You've never had any of your own
BTS Then he and Judge Scott revolvers in hand cautiously descended
BTS Once I asked how it was that he was a revolutionist
BTS It was a hard trip with the mail behind them and the heavy work wore them down
BTS I did not dream that work was so terrible a thing
BTS I took his pulse
BTS No that could not be else he would not have been driven out
BTS for they too knew that safety lay open in the gaining of Fort McGurry
BTS I'm not saying anything O'Connor answered sullenly
BTS Fresh upon his months of mastery over his own team-mates it was beyond his self-control to stand idly by while another devoured the meat that belonged to him
BTS Silence settled down again over the lonely land
BTS But to prevent them from getting behind him he was forced back down past the pool and into the creek bed till he brought up against a high gravel bank
BTS Bishop Morehouse hesitated
BTS What was to happen I knew no more than did I know what had happened
BTS My blood chills when I think of it
BTS Neither the business men nor the laborers had time or opportunity for SOCIETY
BTS The cap'n is Wolf Larsen or so men call him
BTS I feared greatly that she might die in the night
BTS But I answered honestly If it were any other captain except ours I should say you would be ashore in Yokohama to-morrow
BTS An hour later we went proudly back along the path between the harems
BTS Give 'm a fair chance an' if he don't deliver the goods I'll kill 'm myself
BTS In the meantime he accepted all the punishment the other could deal him
BTS If you but knew how many of its leaders have been bought out in similar ways in the past
BTS I asked Johnson whom I took and rightly to be one of the sailors
BTS Not in a day nor a generation were the ravaged sheepfolds to be forgotten
BTS As for snarling he could snarl more terribly than any dog young or old in camp
BTS And now we shall have no hot coffee soup tea or anything
BTS He did the cooking for the other men in the fort the dish-washing and the drudgery
BTS But how did you lose the masts
BTS It was the weak joint in their armor
BTS Another strike
BTS It was at Wake Robin Lodge that Avis Everhard later lived for short periods when disguised as an agent-provocateur of the Iron Heel she was enabled to play with impunity her part among men and events
BTS When I came to the United States I hunted up the socialists
BTS But have you thought of ordering the window-glass
BTS He owed no allegiance to this strange and terrible god
BTS He wandered through the village recognising with staid satisfaction the various gods he had known before the long journey
BTS And there on the deck was a single stick of timber to show for a whole morning's work
BTS I read her name through the glasses as she passed by scarcely a mile to starboard
BTS But was such calculated drift correct
BTS It beats me Mr
BTS But what were you doing while all this was going on
BTS Then the procession started on little spurts of strength coming into White Fang's muscles as he used them and the blood began to surge through them
BTS All the men must have seen my condition but not one spoke or took notice of me till I was almost grateful to Wolf Larsen later on I was washing the dishes when he said Don't let a little thing like that bother you
BTS The next moment he was on his feet again and out in the street prying up a cobblestone
BTS And still it was not a bad night I mused nothing to the nights I had been through on the Ghost
BTS At last his nose touched the canvas
BTS It was an involuntary bristling on his part the physical state that in the past had always accompanied the mental state produced in him by Lip-lip's bullying and persecution
BTS and if I have to I'll do it under oath on the witness stand
BTS They flashed wide open big and black and stared unblinking into our faces
BTS And all the time she was making outcry and striking with her free wing while feathers were flying like a snow-fall
BTS Why should I leave one comfortable soul in comfort when there are millions in travail and misery
BTS They delight in getting trustful-souled gentle reformers before them
BTS Because of its strenuous efforts to dispose of the surplus in the world market the Plutocracy clashed with Germany
BTS If it wasn't for his kindness I'd starve
BTS The wind shrieked a wild song through the rigging
BTS Nobody knew he had been forced to resign from the university
BTS By the joint effort of the workingmen and the capital money is earned
BTS He tried it again with the same result
BTS They camped early that night
BTS He knew it as though it had taken place before his eyes
BTS Haasfurther has charge now of our prescription department was the answer
BTS Then everything happened and with inconceivable rapidity
BTS And you feel well
BTS Well them wolves is land sharks
BTS Then One Eye creeping and crawling every sense on the alert every hair radiating infinite suspicion joined her
BTS I went forward and took my station at the jibs
BTS The moment was dramatic
BTS Then came another stirring of Wolf Larsen's tremendous strength
BTS So I say to you go ahead and preach and earn your pay but for goodness' sake leave the working class alone
BTS I suppose you know a bit about literary things
BTS Then Francois went up to where Sol-leks stood and called to Buck
BTS guard with your preaching the interests of your employers
BTS He did not like it
BTS I wouldn't if I were you I said quietly
BTS It was a slow clumsy and costly way of weaving cloth this cottage system of manufacture
BTS Listen to the word will ye
BTS so 'elp me Gawd I didn't mean it
BTS Very good
BTS He shook his head sadly murmuring Too bad too bad while the hunters burst into guffaws of laughter
BTS And he with his incarnate spirit of battle his gladiator body and his eagle spirit--he was as gentle and tender to me as a poet
BTS It is precisely what I am doing
BTS We started with A B C Mr
BTS and taking her hand I led her on deck
BTS It was intended that the reader should feel his way to these glimmerings
BTS Danger and hurt and death did not lurk everywhere about him
BTS And I do not think there was one who would have interfered had we closed in a death-struggle
BTS The wolf's nailed somebody Matt said
BTS he called
BTS Each of you dwells in a cosmos of his own making created out of his own fancies and desires
BTS Then I smiled
BTS Francois was angry
BTS now he hunted in deadly earnestness and found nothing
BTS Billee terrified into bravery sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the ice
BTS At the sound Kiche leaped snarling to the end of her stick and there raged terribly because she could not come to his aid
BTS Johnson asked
BTS and by the time I had compressed the severed veins and arteries the sailors were singing and heaving in the offending monster
BTS When have you protested to your capitalistic congregations at the working of children in the Southern cotton mills
BTS and in those fields they served the important function of moulding the thought-processes of the nation in the direction of the perpetuity of the Oligarchy
BTS They were creatures of mastery possessing all manner of unknown and impossible potencies overlords of the alive and the not alive making obey that which moved imparting movement to that which did not move and making life sun-coloured and biting life to grow out of dead moss and wood
BTS 'Tis the fear iv death at the hearts iv them Louis muttered in my ear as I passed forward to see to taking in the flying jib and staysail
BTS Labor and capital having produced this one hundred dollars now proceed to divide it
BTS we must dissimulate and win if win we can by craft
BTS Wolf Larsen was counting his winnings
BTS An appreciable pause fell after I had closed the doors and drawn the slide a pause that must have lasted fully a minute
BTS I'll lay you another thousand at that figure Thornton
BTS Ernest's chance for election grew stronger and stronger
BTS Of what use the four walls without a roof
BTS As he phrased it the wires were like the stock market now up now down
BTS The rest of you tail aft to the mainsheet
BTS But I came to work in the mills
BTS Dr
BTS His father was what you call an agitator and his father was in jail for lese majesty--what you call speaking the truth about the Emperor
BTS In fact we thought it was a spontaneous spirit of revolt that would require careful curbing on our part and never dreamed that it was deliberately manufactured--and it had been manufactured so secretly from the very innermost circle of the Iron Heel that we had got no inkling
BTS Yet you expect to sit at an editor's desk some day and conduct a policy
BTS The curve of his neck was turned toward his rival
BTS and several days more found all stays and shrouds in place and everything set up taut
BTS It was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild beasts that prey
BTS It was during Jim Hall's third term in prison that he encountered a guard that was almost as great a beast as he
BTS Was Jackson to blame
BTS Buck whined with suppressed eagerness
BTS But we avoided the issue in spite of the fact that agents-provocateurs swarmed in our midst
BTS A Blessed Wolf amended the Judge's wife
BTS He ripped out a savage oath and clenched his fist as though about to strike me
BTS Then as the short day waned we fell to discussing Wolf Larsen's blindness
BTS Which is another way of saying when their thinking is unacceptable Ernest answered and then went on
BTS Next morning with Maud as able assistant I went into the hold of the Ghost to clear the steps of the mast-butts
BTS He on the other hand being the fastest-footed was unafraid to venture anywhere
BTS And the beauty of it is that you will then add to our strength
BTS And of more  Grub
BTS I intend dying here
BTS I watched for some time curiously but there seemed nothing extraordinary about their behaviour
BTS but Smoke closed his mouth again without having said anything
BTS Van Weyden
BTS Though he often tried to bark thereafter and the master encouraged him he succeeded only once and then it was not in the master's presence
BTS You was never like this before
BTS Leach because he had beaten himself out in the vain struggle and was exhausted
BTS Tell me I went on was it easy to make yourself over from what you were say in high school to the man you must have become to do such a thing at the trial
BTS Nobody seemed interested in the wantonly imperilled life
BTS One was struck at once by his straightforwardness and manliness which in turn were tempered by a modesty which might be mistaken for timidity
BTS Beyond a doubt it was the Macedonia
BTS And anyway you'll agree I've not laid my hands upon them
BTS Have you ever seen the London dockers fighting like wild beasts for a chance to work
BTS He said Amongst the revolutionists I found also warm faith in the human ardent idealism sweetnesses of unselfishness renunciation and martyrdom--all the splendid stinging things of the spirit
BTS He lived tensely
BTS It was because he understood the reproof of my action rather than of my words that he held up his palm for inspection
BTS He crushed them and broke them on his large horns
BTS After that they'll be friends
BTS She had been out-manoeuvred and out-run to say nothing of her having been unceremoniously tumbled in the gravel and her arrival was like that of a tornado made up of offended dignity justifiable wrath and instinctive hatred for this marauder from the Wild
BTS Before a month went by Knowlton paid for his treason with his life
BTS I nodded my head humbly
BTS For that matter there were very few people on the train--only a baker's dozen in our car
BTS It was Maud's and mine
BTS They don't love us an' bloody well glad they'd be a-seein' us cuttin' our throats
BTS Major had made a spring for the meat
BTS but he was staggering his left hand pressed against his forehead and covering his eyes and with the right he was groping about him in a dazed sort of way
BTS Have you any dry clothes I may put on
BTS he exclaimed impatiently
BTS They were forced swept on by this inrolling tide of wealth which their monopoly magnet irresistibly attracted
BTS However in the world could I manage without a tent
BTS Sooner or later he is going to break out and then there's going to be a smash-up
BTS It was like a message from the night of the grave
BTS Then three or four western bad men aspired to clean out the town were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains and public interest turned to other idols
BTS Rockefeller was moved almost to tears
BTS The butt rested against the outside of the port rail while the top of the mast overhung the water far beyond the starboard rail
BTS He came upon one of the man-animals Grey Beaver who was squatting on his hams and doing something with sticks and dry moss spread before him on the ground
BTS And so perished father's book
BTS In mobs composed wholly of themselves they fired and looted buildings and factories
BTS He was twenty pounds lighter but in splendid physical condition
BTS The lynx's bad temper got the best of her
BTS Couldn't tell who or what it was in the dark and just hit out
BTS But especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest reading signs and sounds as man may read a book and seeking for the mysterious something that called called waking or sleeping at all times for him to come
BTS Hal was hurled backward as though struck by a falling tree
BTS Thornton shook his head and stepped to Buck's side
BTS and by the time she joined me I had finished the slaughter and was beginning to skin
BTS Some leaned over at angles as great as forty-five degrees though the majority towered straight up from the soft and almost perpendicular earth walls
BTS They went sullenly but they went
BTS It's a she-wolf Henry whispered back an' that accounts for Fatty an' Frog
BTS And there out in the snow of their back track was the she-wolf waiting for him
BTS At last they went to work on our heap and we could feel the pressure diminish as they dragged away the dead and wounded
BTS His traces were fastened the sled broken out and with both men running they dashed out on to the river trail
BTS so did part of the shark's
BTS There is another way out
BTS The effect was charming
BTS But Matt's foot had already started on its way to kick White Fang
BTS Sol-leks the one-eyed still faithful to the toil of trace and trail and mournful in that he had so little strength with which to pull
BTS He hated the chain that bound him the men who peered in at him through the slats of the pen the dogs that accompanied the men and that snarled malignantly at him in his helplessness
BTS The sermon was of the same order as the ones he had preached long before his eyes had seen visions
BTS At twelve o'clock the southern horizon was warmed by the unseen sun
BTS He knows the meaning of firearms as well as you do
BTS for these were women of my own kind like my mother and sisters with the fear of death upon them and unwilling to die
BTS No woman was ever blessed with a gentler tenderer husband
BTS One leap more and his teeth would be sinking into it
BTS It was a task requiring the utmost nicety and precision and I could not but admire the way he tempered his strength to the fineness and delicacy of the need
BTS And oh the marvel of it
BTS He gave no sign did not even snarl but turned and followed after White Fang
BTS And halfway to the crosstrees and flattened against the rigging by the full force of the wind so that it would have been impossible for me to have fallen the Ghost almost on her beam-ends and the masts parallel with the water I looked not down but at almost right angles from the perpendicular to the deck of the Ghost
BTS In the 'tween-decks of the Narwhal Buck and Curly joined two other dogs
BTS You are not afraid
BTS Will you have to begin all over
BTS and besides you pay for your moments of intellectual delight by having the blues
BTS They live in the same neighborhood--one I can't afford
BTS If I had only known
BTS At midnight the chill wind that blew drove him to shelter at the rear of the cabin
BTS I really do not care to sit in the high places I objected
BTS White Fang saw his mother taken aboard Three Eagles' canoe and tried to follow her
BTS The first struck fifty feet to windward of the boat the second alongside
BTS Something unusual was happening
BTS Then Wolf Larsen shouted from the poop Grab hold something you you Hump
BTS That was the last play of the Wolf he said
BTS This was the first great slave-drive
BTS Yes what
BTS He delighted in it
BTS The destruction of the Roman yeomanry proceeded far less rapidly than the destruction of the American farmers and small capitalists
BTS A cuff from the master and a sharp word had then compelled him to permit their caresses though he growled and growled under their tiny hands and in the growl there was no crooning note
BTS But it is not easy for you to find all of three dollars every month
BTS Nor will you be able to take pleasure in sackcloth he said gravely
BTS The idea was infectious
BTS Come here you whatever-your-name-is
BTS Leach approached me as I returned aft
BTS He tried to growl threateningly ferociously
BTS I looked for the boat and while Wolf Larsen cleared the boat-tackles saw it lift to leeward on a big sea an not a score of feet away
BTS The arm and hand relaxed
BTS I knew then that it was no more than a flesh wound I had felt the steel grate on his shoulder-blade and I raised the knife to strike at a more vital part
BTS I started after her to stop at the foot of the companion-way
BTS My next nightmare vision was a quiet street of the dead
BTS A wolf that knows enough to come in with the dogs at feedin' time has had experiences
BTS Out of this pack-persecution he learned two important things how to take care of himself in a mass-fight against him and how on a single dog to inflict the greatest amount of damage in the briefest space of time
BTS There you go Ernest laughed
BTS he smashed Beauty Smith over backward with a second blow in the face
BTS He placed his paw on one and its movements were accelerated
BTS but to not crawl to be as the clod and rock is loathsome to contemplate
BTS I don't know what happened to the other two
BTS The lawyer was perplexed and worried for a moment and I found it in my heart to pity the wretched little creature
BTS But have you thought upon what would immediately happen
BTS Not fat old Louis I promise you he laughed
BTS Wolf Larsen
BTS I thought of his life
BTS Browning I lived with visions for my company Instead of men and women years ago And found them gentle mates nor thought to know A sweeter music than they played to me
BTS How about this here tide that's rushin' out through the Golden Gate
BTS Henry Bill went on
BTS the life that was in you that composes you that is greater than you did not want to die
BTS He had always been susceptible to the laughter of the gods
BTS And each time the joyful bark that trembled in Buck's throat was twisted into a savage growl
BTS An' God knows where I'll get another boat-puller
BTS Spitz was untouched while Buck was streaming with blood and panting hard
BTS I placed my finger on my lips for silence and entered Wolf Larsen's room
BTS and backward or sideways he would go in the air or sliding on the ground but always with his legs under him and his feet downward to the mother earth
BTS The Plutocracy has all power in its hands to-day
BTS and truly I became strong again
BTS Remember Hartman concluded earnestly
BTS This first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland environment
BTS My hat was gone
BTS But it was no longer his body it seemed so far away
BTS At the instant his jaws closed on it White Fang struck him
BTS I understood the mechanics of levers
BTS Half the men forward are deep-water sailors and their excuse is that they did not know anything about her or her captain
BTS And right here Baseek erred
BTS Into the air he lifted his body in the spring that landed him on the strange god's back
BTS he cried straightening up and turning around on the dog
BTS Instructing her how to hold the turn and be ready to slack away at command I laid hold of the mast with my hands and tried to balance it inboard across the rail
BTS but we all knew what he did before he died
BTS and ere the first day was done he was pulling more than ever before in his life
BTS After this Jim Hall went to live in the incorrigible cell
BTS Yet in spite of his style there was much that I did not like
BTS And further the police had arranged in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man and he was travelling light
BTS Once his teeth closed on the fore leg of a husky and he crunched down through the bone
BTS And then I thought of the Sierra Mills and the dividends that had been paid and I saw the blood of Jackson upon my gown as well
BTS They were starting dead weary
BTS Put him under the X-ray anything
BTS The United States and the whole world for that matter will enter upon a new and tremendous era
BTS Then he peered over the rail with levelled rifle
BTS I was too tired to thrash my arms about and warm myself but I found strength time and again to chafe her hands and feet to restore the circulation
BTS Owen insisted
BTS We knew it
BTS Besides we had been so long on a cold diet that we were numb inside as well as out
BTS In the lower bunk lay Louis grossly fat and warm and sweaty asleep unfeignedly and sleeping laboriously
BTS Both have grown very fat
BTS But the cub did not think in man-fashion
BTS Thornton stood between him and Buck and evinced no intention of getting out of the way
BTS He shrugged his shoulders or attempted to shrug them rather for the left shoulder alone moved
BTS for these dogs and men were not town dogs and men
BTS When Mugridge was directly beneath us the stern descended the slope of a passing wave thus giving the advantage to the shark
BTS This is compulsory
BTS Her eyes looked bravely into mine
BTS The Church condones the frightful brutality and savagery with which the capitalist class treats the working class
BTS Served me right Matt argued stubbornly
BTS They wanted to live they were helpless like rats in a trap and they screamed
BTS His heart was not in the work nor was the heart of any dog
BTS And not for nothing had his puppyhood been made bitter by the persecution of Lip-lip and the whole puppy pack
BTS From without as through thick walls came the muffled roar of bursting bombs
BTS A colossal and formless something was rushing across the field of his vision
BTS A bleakness came into his eyes and the lines of his mouth grew severe and harsh
BTS A large paper bag in his right hand fell to the sidewalk
BTS The bill was introduced on June 30 and not on July 30
BTS Therefore it won't be a general strike
BTS His big fists were clenching and unclenching and his face was positively fiendish so malignantly did he look at Johnson
BTS One was real the other was a dream but which was which
BTS And you
BTS Dr
BTS Beauty Smith had regained his feet and come over to look at White Fang
BTS We noticed something strange about him at once
BTS It struck their sense of humor
BTS Moose were scarce the rabbits almost disappeared hunting and preying animals perished
BTS Next morning No
BTS Like him they were domesticated wolves
BTS Collie's teeth were no longer sharp
BTS The reporter merely dropped out social
BTS Built directly in the eyes of the schooner it was of the shape of a triangle along the three sides of which stood the bunks in double-tier twelve of them
BTS For a time the man-animals continued to make their mouth-noises
BTS one of the men bellowed in his ear shaking him roughly
BTS Good-by and good luck
BTS His eyes were closed but the lids slightly lifted in an effort to look at them as they bent over him and the tail was perceptibly agitated in a vain effort to wag
BTS Liquor in large quantities was distributed among the slum classes further to inflame their minds
BTS A question was called to the fireman by an officer in an automobile and we heard one shout in reply No water
BTS Poor betrayed labor
BTS There was Judge Scott and there was his wife
BTS he demanded
BTS By the edge head and fore feet in the water lay Skeet faithful to the last
BTS Not a man believed him capable of the feat
BTS The leaders lifted the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods
BTS LEG-BAR--the African slaves were so manacled
BTS I am used to it
BTS he cried and I heard through the tumult as one might hear a whisper
BTS When she was an old woman of sixty-nine she shot Bloody Halcliffe down in the midst of his armed escort and got away unscathed
BTS We will grind you revolutionists down under our heel and we shall walk upon your faces
BTS Sometimes he ventured north of Market Street into the shopping and theatre district where he sold papers ran errands and opened cabs
BTS Mugridge's face was livid with fear at what he had done and at what he might expect sooner or later from the man he had stabbed
BTS He could not understand at first
BTS He glanced at the hand that held the brand noticing the cunning delicacy of the fingers that gripped it how they adjusted themselves to all the inequalities of the surface curling over and under and about the rough wood and one little finger too close to the burning portion of the brand sensitively and automatically writhing back from the hurtful heat to a cooler gripping-place
BTS He lied he stole he did all sorts of dishonorable things to put bread into my mouth and into the mouths of my brothers and sisters
BTS Kelly asked and as he went on he looked murderously about him unless one of us peaches
BTS I hope to fill every room in my palace with such sisters as they
BTS The explanation is simple
BTS But there should be no conflict of interest
BTS Oh I assure you I know the frightful persecution they can wage on a professor who is economically dependent on his university
BTS The supply is too large
BTS H
BTS It is true she worked hard but I cannot understand
BTS What's the drift eh
BTS No telegraphic communication
BTS In point of fact the cuff was rarely administered
BTS Your flesh is not afraid
BTS And upon this and him Louis passed judgment and prophecy
BTS And some men are made sick by the one and some by the other
BTS but at the time he suspected nothing
BTS He broke down and began to cry and yelp
BTS And there it is
BTS That's why
BTS His muzzle went up his tail stiffened and his nostrils dilated as he scented the air
BTS In the main so efficient a fighter had he become he went his way unscathed
BTS He did not appear even amused at the other's antics
BTS That settles it he announced
BTS and Wolf Larsen paused once or twice at the break of the poop to glance curiously at what must have been to him a stirring and crawling of the yeasty thing he knew as life
BTS I knew these men and their mental processes was one of them myself living the seal-hunting life eating the seal-hunting fare thinking largely the seal-hunting thoughts
BTS But the beating
BTS has been described as follows A long lean head semicircled by a fringe of brown and gray hair with big cheek-bones and a heavy chin
BTS His behavior in our drawing-room reminded me of a careful bull in a china shop
BTS And then came the foremast larger in diameter and weighing surely thirty-five hundred pounds
BTS The narrow scientist with his nose in a test-tube cannot understand philosophy
BTS But they were supremely interested for every little while they ardently took sides and sometimes all were talking at once till their voices surged back and forth in waves of sound like mimic thunder-rolls in the confined space
BTS demanded Matthewson a Bonanza King he of the seven hundred vaunt
BTS It was a most wasteful expenditure of energy
BTS Where the bow cut the water there was a great foaming and gurgling and I seemed directly in its path
BTS Just at the moment I came out of the butcher-shop a man emerged from the corner grocery that stood alongside
BTS Mr
BTS It was a placing of his destiny in another's hands a shifting of the responsibilities of existence
BTS Billee was crying as usual
BTS Then a most surprising thing occurred
BTS It was introduced by Representative Dick of Ohio
BTS Is it a go
BTS We would not be so foolish
BTS For no other reason did Rudolph Mendenhall flame out his soul for the Cause and sing his wild swan-song that last night of life
BTS This in itself did not amount to much
BTS Then he and the crate in which he was imprisoned began a passage through many hands
BTS The expression on his face was one of complete comprehension
BTS There that'll fix you fool critters Bill said with satisfaction that night standing erect at completion of his task
BTS She poised for a moment then sprang for the dancing rabbit
BTS I looked for his instant annihilation
BTS Which we shall not I know
BTS Sir he corrected not harshly but sternly
BTS For we converted him in the end
BTS The kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated hand
BTS I remember his putting his hand up to feel of the wound on his head and my watching the biceps move like a living thing under its white sheath
BTS In fact we slept till three in the afternoon or at least I did for I awoke to find Maud cooking dinner
BTS Therefrom comes their sanction to manage the bread and butter of the rest of mankind
BTS The Corsican knew
BTS but Wolf Larsen held back through the frightful turmoil as if guided by unerring instinct
BTS I t'ink so mineself Hans affirmed
BTS White Fang gazed at him wistfully
BTS Half a mile of the mob had swept by when we were discovered
BTS Tim Keenan stepped in and bent over Cherokee fondling him on both sides of the shoulders with hands that rubbed against the grain of the hair and that made slight pushing-forward movements
BTS I was never brave till I knew you
BTS I asked
BTS Then the hope died down as he added shaking his head We've had him two weeks now and if anything he's wilder than ever at the present moment
BTS The cook stuck his head out of the galley door and grinned encouragingly at me at the same time jerking his thumb in the direction of the man who paced up and down by the hatchway
BTS It was warm and comfortable and he was playing cribbage with the Factor
BTS What kind of value
BTS The wild wave of famished beasts rolled back before them and Buck shook himself free
BTS He tried to outrun her by leaving the drive and circling across the lawn but she ran on the inner and smaller circle and was always there facing him with her two rows of gleaming teeth
BTS the man shouted
BTS But he did not know why he did these various things
BTS And out of this classification arose the law
BTS She compromised however by taking upon herself the lighter labours of cooking and gathering driftwood and moss for our winter's supply
BTS And I have learned a great lesson
BTS I know the kind
BTS There was no question about it no discussion
BTS His height was probably five feet ten inches or ten and a half
BTS This construction enabled the weight of the sled and load to be distributed over the largest snow-surface
BTS Her eyes were too heavy to suggest more than a hint of the sleepy surprise that perplexed her as she looked up at me and she half stumbled half tottered as I led her to her cabin
BTS Hated by his kind and by mankind indomitable perpetually warred upon and himself waging perpetual war his development was rapid and one-sided
BTS Every blow was shrewd to hurt
BTS Francois fastened upon him an arrangement of straps and buckles
BTS He had eaten the ptarmigan chicks
BTS In addition the persecution he had suffered from the pack had made the pack less to him in the scheme of things and man more
BTS This of course was due to the excess of unconsumed profits that was piled up
BTS I could not hurt a fly I smiled back bitterly
BTS he sneered
BTS Just as all was ready and the coffee poured the door opened and she came forth
BTS In short the metaphysicians have done nothing absolutely nothing for mankind
BTS It was not a good grip being too low down toward the chest
BTS My words had been decisive
BTS Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with Buck who in a dying condition was unable to resent her first advances
BTS White Fang's feel of Beauty Smith was bad
BTS Before he knew what he was doing he had slashed the intruder twice and sprung clear
BTS From this day we live in the cabin
BTS We tied our horses among the redwoods at the pool
BTS He knew only grief for the loss of Kiche hope for her return and a hungry yearning for the free life that had been his
BTS The cook grinned at my exhibition of nerves and thrust into my hand a steaming mug with an 'Ere this'll do yer good
BTS Maud could not stand nor had I strength to carry her
BTS The life that is in you cries out that it must live no matter what the cost
BTS The confusion and babel was indescribable
BTS It was heartbreaking only Buck's heart was unbreakable
BTS But as I was without experience and as every detail was an experiment and every successful detail an invention the day was well gone before her shelter was an accomplished fact
BTS I do not have much faith in politics
BTS But that is far-fetched I objected
BTS Johnson has been guilty of speaking his mind too freely and has collided two or three times with Wolf Larsen over the pronunciation of his name
BTS Two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses into shape and the wound-stiffened team was under way struggling painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered and for that matter the hardest between them and Dawson
BTS but I learned now that I had never comprehended the deeper significance of such a situation the thing the writers harped upon and exploited so thoroughly
BTS but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry and he came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek
BTS My hold had been broken loose I was under water and the thought passed through my mind that this was the terrible thing of which I had heard the being swept in the trough of the sea
BTS Perrault nodded gravely
BTS Out of others
BTS The crackling turned into a snapping the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and grating several inches to the side
BTS The brutal years had reduced his meagre body to splintered wreckage and yet the spark of life within burned brightly as ever
BTS What
BTS Placing this under his shoulders I balanced him across the threshold and lowered him down the steps to the floor
BTS I don't hope to get an auto but I'll surely bring some grub anyway
BTS Down the neck and across the shoulders his mane in repose as it was half bristled and seemed to lift with every movement as though excess of vigor made each particular hair alive and active
BTS My bruised and swollen hands could no longer close on the oar handles
BTS Wickson as much as told me so
BTS No not that she answered
BTS The mob came on but it could not advance
BTS The man saved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm but was hurled backward to the floor with Buck on top of him
BTS As it filled the Ghost's bow swung off and I had to put the wheel down a few spokes and steady her
BTS I do no sin for I am true to the promptings of the life that is in me
BTS Faint strange sounds came from within
BTS and these with the exception of the part-grown puppies were likewise burdened with camp outfit
BTS And when the sun was up I was scorched and because I had no root I withered away
BTS Then it was that we socialists reaped the fruit of Hearst's pseudo-socialistic preaching
BTS You'd better get on your course then I chided
BTS and it dominates the call loan market on Wall Street and the stock market
BTS I shall try to write simply and to tell here how Ernest Everhard entered my life--how I first met him how he grew until I became a part of him and the tremendous changes he wrought in my life
BTS You have made no attempt to answer
BTS I already know he said quietly though his Irish eyes were flashing
BTS We have wandered far from the Master's teaching
BTS It was a tree-shadow flung by the moon from whose face the clouds had been brushed away
BTS They were meat and it was hungry
BTS It was shortly after this day that Ernest told me as a good story the offer he had received from the government namely an appointment as United States Commissioner of Labor
BTS I do not know whether Wolf Larsen cheated or not a thing he was thoroughly capable of doing but he won steadily
BTS So large was the supply of things that a number of trips would be necessary to carry them to the refuge
BTS I understand she said in a weak far-away voice and her eyes showed me that she did understand
BTS White Fang was howling as dogs howl when their masters lie dead
BTS This house was completely hidden from any chance eye that might peer down from the edge of the hole
BTS Live things were meat
BTS Dr
BTS Round and round he went whirling and turning and reversing trying to shake off the fifty-pound weight that dragged at his throat
BTS You have the chance always he sneered
BTS I could never fight my way out as Wolf Larsen had done
BTS Now I'll 'ave to boil some more
BTS His arms were folded one above the other across his face and throat
BTS This confusion in the front of the moving pack always caused confusion in the rear
BTS The soldier was clumsy
BTS All of which you will pardon my observing has nothing whatsoever to do with what I wish to see you about
BTS The wild Indian is not so brutal and savage as the capitalist class he answered
BTS In the second dog-watch the sailors come on deck stripped and heave buckets of water upon one another from overside
BTS The dogs were tired the drivers grumbling and to make matters worse it snowed every day
BTS Wolf Larsen was the leopard
BTS and on the land I would have been lying on the broad of my back with a surgeon attending on me and with strict injunctions to do nothing but rest
BTS If I promise not to lay my hands upon Leach will you promise in turn not to attempt to kill me
BTS His face became more expectant and tense as he tried to analyze and identify the impression
BTS I could not squirm or struggle like a schoolboy
BTS He ran awkwardly but he ran well
BTS There will be a second and we will be wiser then
BTS His cigar went out and he continued to gaze silently and curiously
BTS Well I'll be everlastingly gosh-swoggled
BTS You couldn't walk alone between two sunrises and hustle the meat for your belly for three meals
BTS This man who endowed chairs in universities and erected magnificent chapels perjured himself in courts of law over dollars and cents
BTS You'll find some old canvas in the sail-locker
BTS To man has been given the grief often of seeing his gods overthrown and his altars crumbling
BTS Why if there is anything in supply and demand life is the cheapest thing in the world
BTS And in the meanwhile I must ask you to come inside with me
BTS He came to where Grey Beaver's tepee had stood
BTS A state home for the feeble-minded had also been demolished to make room for the deer
BTS He should be alive to-day like your father
BTS The abjectness of their servitude is incomprehensible to us
BTS Fear was strong in their faces and the devilishness which comes of fear
BTS Then he talked harshly to the unwitting culprit and in his voice there was nothing but godlike wrath
BTS Kiche turned and slowly trotted back toward camp
BTS Epitomized their doctrine was Why should the workingmen of one country fight with the workingmen of another country for the benefit of their capitalist masters
BTS One day While Fang encountered a young wolf gaunt and scrawny loose-jointed with famine
BTS Class hatred is anti-social and it seems to me anti-socialistic
BTS He laughed one of his horrible mocking laughs
BTS But you go to those books to learn
BTS It is so stated in all the history books
BTS Withdrawn from the immediate scramble of the other dogs in fact out of sight behind a thicket he was devouring his prize when Baseek rushed in upon him
BTS In addition to being exhibited he was a professional fighting animal
BTS Life had become cheap and tawdry a beastly and inarticulate thing a soulless stirring of the ooze and slime
BTS There lies the temptation
BTS As long as workingmen and capitalists exist they will continue to quarrel over the division
BTS Both the Bishop and my father were embarrassed and perturbed
BTS I wish to be put ashore I said firmly for I now had myself in control
BTS Over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm
BTS They were a little frightened at this smooth-faced young fellow and the swing and smash of his words and his dreadful trait of calling a spade a spade
BTS All three faced him
BTS He never nipped Buck without cause and he never failed to nip him when he stood in need of it
BTS I had learned whenever he praised Ernest in such fashion to expect disaster
BTS From Cuba to California out of scores of jails military prisons and fortresses in a single night we delivered fifty-one of our fifty-two Congressmen and in addition over three hundred other leaders
BTS It was the wolf in him that I saw and a mad wolf at that
BTS Get the cards Hump Wolf Larsen ordered as they took seats at the table
BTS He was armed with the weapons of the slain guards a live arsenal that fled through the hills pursued by the organised might of society
BTS Therein you are both wrong
BTS The Cockney's body left the water
BTS And before he could recover I'd have him bound hard and fast
BTS They were developing in him and the camp-life replete with misery as it was was secretly endearing itself to him all the time
BTS and coming home late at night worn out from the strain of the campaign he would plunge into his translating and toil on well into the morning hours
BTS I said solemnly
BTS Out of others
BTS There was the matter of the house--our home
BTS When he flung himself against the bars quivering and frothing they laughed at him and taunted him
BTS George Leach sir came the sullen answer and the boy's bearing showed clearly that he divined the reason for which he had been summoned
BTS And certainly it was he that caused the mother the most trouble in keeping her litter from the mouth of the cave
BTS Capital takes fifty dollars as its share and labor gets in wages fifty dollars as its share
BTS I must say however that the sailors themselves were sympathetic as instance the case of Johnson
BTS I borrowed a whetstone from Johansen
BTS The steerage where were two wounded hunters was a repetition of the forecastle except that Wolf Larsen was not being cursed
BTS She was like a feather in my arms so slender so ethereal
BTS Six
BTS Curly was the victim
BTS There did you see that
BTS While the remains of Jim Hall were discovered on a dozen mountain-sides by greedy claimants for blood-money
BTS In the first place his clothes did not fit him
BTS Their homes were palaces
BTS A mortgage was foreclosed on it and we had to give up possession
BTS That's it
BTS But I can't give him the lesson until I catch him in the act
BTS I tried to withdraw it but his fingers tightened without visible effort till I thought mine would be crushed
BTS Now he studied the sea to windward for signs of the wind slackening or freshening now the Macedonia
BTS You know today without my telling you that the Railroad Trust owns or controls the entire anthracite and bituminous coal fields
BTS One hundred and eighty-five dollars even he said aloud
BTS Henry cried in wrath leaving the cooking to come and count the dogs
BTS Biedenbach the gentle had destroyed a fortress
BTS He stepped out of the companion-way and came up to me
BTS I'm bitter enough over it as it is
BTS Careful as you go
BTS The way was clear and that was all he had wanted
BTS There was yet time
BTS You're going in for grab-sharing
BTS If you will remember some of the seed fell upon stony places where there was not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth
BTS The dog's a mint
BTS The hard times at home had caused an immense decrease in consumption
BTS Each of you goes into his own consciousness to explain himself and the universe
BTS He was back in his rent and the oldest boy a lad of eleven had started to work in the mills
BTS It was this automatic assumption of a role that was considered imperative
BTS I hardly think you'll care to sacrifice the Dean of American Letters the Second he sneered
BTS Where was the grandeur of life that it should permit such wanton destruction of human souls
BTS For once White Fang did not make an immediate attack
BTS Am I not right
BTS Thornton was sent spinning and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of the bar
BTS Raa
BTS The masts booms and gaffs I had cleared were gone
BTS It may be wondered how we came to know of the affair at all
BTS Her eyes lifted curiously to mine
BTS Tim Keenan shoved the bull-dog forward with a muttered Go to it
BTS It was rushed through
BTS Look the matter in the face and state it in direct terms
BTS She dropped her head with her nose to the ground and directed toward a point near to her closely bunched feet and around this point she circled several times
BTS As we entered I could have sworn I saw a vague bulk emerging to windward
BTS Sometimes the laborers refused to work
BTS But think of the chickens objected the judge
BTS He really looked stupid
BTS His back was toward me and at the first feel of my hand he leaped upright in the air and away from me snarling and turning his head as he leaped
BTS And even I felt a great joy surge up within me
BTS I bet he was yelpin' as he went down their throats damn 'em
BTS White Fang knew nothing about fire
BTS said Maud
BTS And then suddenly he turned upon her
BTS He hated and feared their hands
BTS You may be wrong but whether you are wrong or right I shall stand by my guns
BTS Hammerfield
BTS but his communications were ignored
BTS In Chicago there are women who toil all the week for ninety cents
BTS This accomplished he pried gently and carefully loosening the jaws a bit at a time while Matt a bit at a time extricated White Fang's mangled neck
BTS They were powers these two women what of the money that was theirs
BTS He exchanged the whip for the customary club
BTS You can no more make water run up hill than can you cause the tide of economic evolution to flow back in its channel along the way it came
BTS and here he muses for a time howling once long and mournfully ere he departs
BTS I must get the jib backed over
BTS They did not go far a couple of days' journey
BTS ' Labor's share is called 'wages
BTS To my shame be it I cowered away from the blow and ran out the galley door
BTS He was not prone to rashness and precipitate action
BTS In the same way he came to tolerate Matt as a possession of his master
BTS The white men were no exception to this
BTS He tugged still harder and repeatedly until the whole tepee was in motion
BTS And on being solicited he explained
BTS Wolf Larsen queried his voice soft and low and purring
BTS I beg your pardon he said the next moment
BTS And where am I
BTS And bah
BTS He did not know anything about entrances passages whereby one goes from one place to another place
BTS Louis surveyed me with his shrewd grey eyes and shook his head portentously
BTS For the better part of an hour the wild brother ran by his side whining softly
BTS And yet I was unafraid
BTS This be the sign of it Grey Beaver went on
BTS Life when it knows that it must cease living will always rebel
BTS White Fang knew the law well to oppress the weak and obey the strong
BTS You an' me Henry when we die we'll be lucky if we get enough stones over our carcases to keep the dogs off of us
BTS There was glee in our eyes and suppressed titters in our mouths as we put on our shoes and clambered over the side into the boat
BTS Weedon Scott pressed a button and the staircase and downstairs hall were flooded with light
BTS As before the Ghost swung out of the trough lifting her deck again out of the sea and dashed before the howling blast
BTS White Fang sensed the coming calamity even before there was tangible evidence of it
BTS He could get little air and that little grew less and less under the merciless grip that ever tightened
BTS In Chicago while on a visit to the United States he was asked by a newspaper reporter for his opinion of that city
BTS His old code of conduct was changing
BTS My mind did not work quickly everything was so new and strange
BTS When at last he succeeded in rolling clear of her he crawled to his feet badly dishevelled hurt both in body and in spirit
BTS Thenceforth in the nature of things he would possess an abiding distrust of appearances
BTS Kind-hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered belongings
BTS Also a fellow-Senator Chauncey Depew said The American people produce annually two billions more wealth than they consume
BTS In the United States to-day there are fifteen million people living in poverty
BTS The hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on the ground swinging by the arms from limb to limb sometimes a dozen feet apart letting go and catching never falling never missing his grip
BTS Thus by carrying this tackle to the windlass I could raise and lower the end of the boom at will the butt always remaining stationary and by means of guys I could swing the boom from side to side
BTS At night when the god returned home White Fang would leave the warm sleeping-place he had burrowed in the snow in order to receive the friendly snap of fingers and the word of greeting
BTS There was a shaking of heads and mutterings arose
BTS It was dark
BTS and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley toward camp he proceeded with greater caution
BTS But to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck shutting off his breath
BTS But there was another sound
BTS He had never seen such a dog before
BTS He dived out of the galley door or glided rather with a swiftness and smoothness of gait that struck me as being not so much cat-like as oily
BTS His fangs be white and White Fang shall be his name
BTS I was choking and suffocating by the time I reached Wolf Larsen's bunk
BTS His rifle was between his knees but if he let go the steering-oar in order to shoot the boat would sweep around and collide with the schooner
BTS They dropped their whole supply of expedite upon the locomotive
BTS and he knew more of its secrets and stratagems
BTS Grey Beaver continued to beat White Fang continued to snarl
BTS Only a short time ago I had my books gone through for the past ten years
BTS What I saw I could not at first believe
BTS Coffee
BTS There was no escape for White Fang
BTS One such potency was love
BTS Yes by your law the terrorist replied significantly
BTS It was an imminent peril
BTS The cub had broken through the wall of the world the unknown had let go its hold of him and here he was without hurt
BTS I wanted to see him mastering men in discussion the war-note in his voice
BTS The Oligarchy wanted violence and it set its agents-provocateurs to work
BTS He was voicing an utter woe his cry bursting upward in great heart-breaking rushes dying down into quavering misery and bursting upward again with a rush upon rush of grief
BTS You see I've
BTS Also such a war would create a large standing army that need never be disbanded while in the minds of the people would be substituted the issue America versus Germany in place of Socialism versus Oligarchy
BTS Two billions
BTS under British rule in India
BTS The troops operated on the basis that no man not an outlaw remained in the mountains
BTS For such countries nothing remained but reorganization
BTS I do not forget one night when I should have been asleep of lying on the forecastle-head and gazing down at the spectral ripple of foam thrust aside by the Ghost's forefoot
BTS CHAPTER XXI THE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST During the long period of our stay in the refuge we were kept closely in touch with what was happening in the world without and we were learning thoroughly the strength of the Oligarchy with which we were at war
BTS Couldn't make yourself scarce too quick with several gentlemen you may have heard of looking for you
BTS Unconscious of my blunder I passed by Wolf Larsen and the hunter and flung the ashes over the side to windward
BTS But the wind
BTS but keep your lamps out for thruppenny-bits or the publicans 'll shove 'em on you for sixpence
BTS And he was the food they were to eat
BTS For when one of the sailors lifted her into Wolf Larsen's downstretched arms she looked up into our curious faces and smiled amusedly and sweetly as only a woman can smile and as I had seen no one smile for so long that I had forgotten such smiles existed
BTS Steering I picked up easily but running aloft to the crosstrees and swinging my whole weight by my arms when I left the ratlines and climbed still higher was more difficult

BTS Why shouldn't it
BTS Take Collie inside and leave the two of them to fight it out suggested Scott's father
BTS But as they grew shorter and White Fang's second winter in the Southland came on he made a strange discovery
BTS Buck sprang upon Sol-leks in a fury driving him back and standing in his place
BTS Chicago had always been the storm-centre of the conflict between labor and capital a city of street-battles and violent death with a class-conscious capitalist organization and a class-conscious workman organization where in the old days the very school-teachers were formed into labor unions and affiliated with the hod-carriers and brick-layers in the American Federation of Labor
BTS He had sprung fully six feet across the deck and driven his fist into the other's stomach
BTS Fatty's gone
BTS but Buck knew and every dog knew what had taken place behind the belt of river trees

BTS When he dozed despite himself the whimpering and snarling of the dogs aroused him
BTS It is so directly brutal you know
BTS and once eaten the juices of his stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment
BTS Even grown dogs might hurtle him backward or sideways with the impact of their heavy bodies
BTS But more things and most grievous ones were happening with equal suddenness
BTS This was an affair of the gods and no concern of his
BTS or that his vision was coming back
BTS For this likewise he respected his mother
BTS One day she led him off on a long chase through the back-pasture land into the woods
BTS The dog-musher made a rush of it and White Fang dodged between the legs of a group of men
BTS And Mr
BTS Only what
BTS An' I doubt me if there's a man in the mills that'd put out a hand to drag me from drownin'

BTS It cried out with terror at the same time snarling and scrambled back to cool its paws in the snow
BTS One thing was plain Jackson's situation was wretched
BTS yet I could not escape smiling at Garthwaite who was rolling a cigarette and saying I know I'm making a mess of rescuing you but I can't get head nor tail of the situation

BTS For no other reason has John Carlson been the faithful and unrewarded custodian of the Glen Ellen Refuge
BTS Not a word could I get from him concerning the trial and his testimony
BTS --nothing save one final awful glut of vengeance
BTS The master himself was looking on and did not interfere
BTS The unknown bore him on he knew not to what frightful hurt and he yelped and ki-yi'd unceasingly
BTS At the sound of it the strange animal leaped back into the darkness
BTS We saw the end of the young officer who had rescued us
BTS I can hear him now as I shall always hear him the primal melancholy vibrant in his voice as he read I gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces
BTS Or do I have to take you in hand
BTS This he did and he quickly achieved for them a mighty contempt
BTS I covered her with oilskins and a tarpaulin
BTS Yet so thoroughly had he prepared for the revolt that his fellow-conspirators were able with little confusion or delay to carry out his plans

BTS The grey mist drove by us like a rain
BTS Nay the tale grows worse
BTS but in a short time the master capitalists found it cheaper to own the political machines themselves and to hire the machine bosses
BTS Give us that which we have sought so long--the test of truth
BTS He's one of us and he's in the Mercenaries and I'm afraid for him
BTS but still there was about him a suggestion of lurking ferocity as though the Wild still lingered in him and the wolf in him merely slept
BTS He took his book and turned back several pages
BTS Several days later the brief announcement was made that he had gone away on a vacation to recover from the effects of overwork
BTS When you rise in your strength remember the reason for your rising will be that the government is in the hands of the trusts
BTS She looked at White Fang who snarled and bristled and glared malevolently
BTS It does very well it seems though I am not versed in things nautical she said nodding her head with grave approval at my steering contrivance
BTS Colonel Van Gilbert quite forgot that he was presiding and that in courtesy he should permit the other clamorers to speak
BTS I cannot sit idly by and wait the great event that is his making though he is not here to see
BTS Your illustration is most unfortunate Ernest replied
BTS Somehow I who have always had expression lacked expression when with Wolf Larsen
BTS I had succumbed and slept where I sat in the stern-sheets
BTS ' When I returned on deck I found Wolf Larsen steering mainly with one hand while with the other hand he held the marine glasses and studied the situation of the boats paying particular attention to the position of the Macedonia
BTS As we drew closer the sail was taken in and the mast unstepped
BTS It was by sheer blundering that he chanced upon the shrewdly hidden ptarmigan nest
BTS Here was indubitable evidence
BTS He was shot by one of our lookouts at the cave-refuge at Carmel through failure on his part to remember the secret signals
BTS Take a turn he said quietly to the man
BTS But White Fang learned to omit these preliminaries
BTS But White Fang did not mind
BTS Remember the tide of evolution never flows backward
BTS He only charges three dollars for this room
BTS The distance had been measured off and as he neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards a cheer began to grow and grow which burst into a roar as he passed the firewood and halted at command
BTS And the thought of it was so much added power
BTS An' as he was a-gettin' under way didn't the fond husbands get left astern-like in their sampan as it might be by accident
BTS At such times White Fang leaned in close against the master's legs and received reassuring pats on the head
BTS There was now much resting and sleeping
BTS And here confined hidden from view all except his ears no longer growling he continued to nudge and snuggle
BTS Please please understand me I said hurriedly lowering my voice
BTS I was becoming interested in the man
BTS But I miscalculated the point of balance so that when I heaved the top of the mast came up instead of the butt
BTS Hartman was hopelessly depressed
BTS It was no longer his dog
BTS It was preacher's night as my father privately called it and Ernest was certainly out of place in the midst of the churchmen
BTS The groom escaped into the stables and White Fang backed away before Collie's wicked teeth or presented his shoulder to them and circled round and round
BTS He tried to take White Fang's meat an' he's dead-O
BTS Maud Brewster
BTS I do nothing can do nothing because I am a slave to this monster as you are now a slave to him
BTS It had stopped and the master was alighting

BTS Yes Blessed Wolf agreed the Judge
BTS The incumbents refused to retire and the courts were in the hands of the Oligarchy
BTS About his neck was put a moss-stuffed collar which was connected by two pulling-traces to a strap that passed around his chest and over his back
BTS But there was no sleep for me
BTS To his astonishment they had disappeared
BTS There is no clew to the name of the organization for which these initials stand
BTS Not at all
BTS His mother represented power
BTS Bill opened his mouth to speak but changed his mind
BTS He was getting his scattered wits slightly in hand
BTS From then on it was war between them
BTS After some time of this Francois threw down the club thinking that Buck feared a thrashing
BTS One by one the wolves joined her till the whole pack on haunches with noses pointed skyward was howling its hunger cry
BTS she asked sleepily and withal curiously
BTS She shook her head decidedly and Charles and Hal put the last odds and ends on top the mountainous load
BTS A line connected it with the bow and as it floated low in the water practically unexposed to the wind it drifted less rapidly than the boat
BTS The one thing of which he had always been particularly jealous was his head
BTS In the meantime the newspapers were read at Sierra Vista not so much with interest as with anxiety
BTS It can be done it can be done I was thinking and asserting aloud
BTS He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up
BTS Thirteen men were killed and many more were wounded
BTS Her power of recuperation was wonderful
BTS The master talked to him gently but seriously and he cocked his ears and listened with painful intentness
BTS and second by climbing out the peak-halyards to the end of the gaff itself an exceedingly hazardous performance
BTS but a side-flick of the tail sank sharp quills into it as it was withdrawn
BTS He forgot that she had made life a burden to him and when she disported herself around him he responded solemnly striving to be playful and becoming no more than ridiculous
BTS And now I ask you again what are we going to do with those surpluses
BTS I tell you straight I wouldn't risk my carcass on that ice for all the gold in Alaska
BTS There was no common speech by which he might learn what he wanted to know
BTS You may gather data on the immortality of the soul
BTS I was only Humphrey Van Weyden a bookish fellow who loved
BTS The sailor Johnson was steering
BTS We were very comfortable and the inadequate shears with the foremast suspended from them gave a business-like air to the schooner and a promise of departure
BTS he cried
BTS And I can say flatly without qualification or doubt of any sort that the socialists in Congress and out had no hand in the affair
BTS On the instant my flesh was creeping and crawling from the harsh contact
BTS And who in hell is Weedon Scott
BTS It was at this time that vanished my last doubt of the completeness of my love for him a subconscious doubt at most
BTS He lives on the Hill back of the Mayfair bakery runnin' a cobbler's shop that everybody knows and you'll have no trouble
BTS White Fang took kindly to the work
BTS Here in the running stream where ice was beginning to form he hid his trail
BTS This was the ancient covenant that the first wolf that came in from the Wild entered into with man
BTS I struggled to my feet with difficulty dragging myself clear of the wrecked door unaware of any hurt whatever
BTS CHAPTER IV THE CALL OF KIND The months came and went
BTS The sun had come back and all the awakening Northland world was calling to him
BTS When you say you are here I'd suggest the likelihood of the soul I said
BTS Tie a rag around it and it'll be all right
BTS Wolf Larsen looked savagely at the vessel while Maud Brewster was curious
BTS I said
BTS From Brazil the United States in return for her surplus gets bonds and securities
BTS I burst into tears of mortification and hurt vanity
BTS Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land
BTS They starved
BTS It was the final word
BTS Therefore White Fang obeyed him
BTS We have no need for it
BTS I think the Bishop's example so far as wearing apparel was concerned must have fascinated father for he wore the cheap cotton shirt of the laborer and the overalls with the narrow strap about the hips
BTS He had sunk down on the snow in the circle of his blood and was plainly in the last gasp
BTS 'According to common custom you might give me a dime
BTS the dog-musher began softly then changed his mind and betrayed a rising anger of his own
BTS That tiny men should live and breathe and work and drive so frail a contrivance of wood and cloth through so tremendous an elemental strife
BTS We must have been struck squarely amidships for I saw nothing the strange steamboat having passed beyond my line of vision
BTS And so with our disguises
BTS But my woman my mate kept ringing in my head for the rest of the day and for many days
BTS but he never gave to them what he gave to the master
BTS The master thought of writing a note but searched his pockets vainly for pencil and paper
BTS He had met Ernest shortly prior to the preacher's night
BTS He was too busy adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease and not only did he not pick fights but he avoided them whenever possible
BTS The blot of smoke had suddenly grown larger and it was very black
BTS There was nothing the matter with them except that they were dead tired
BTS If one man could be so monstrously treated and society move on its way unheeding might not many men be so monstrously treated
BTS The conditions were frightful
BTS All markets were glutted
BTS Humphrey sir
BTS He stood by the weather rail for a time we were lowering over the lee rail and then sauntered slowly amidships where he again paused and stood facing the wind with his back toward us
BTS I had actually at times considered myself outside the pale a monkish fellow denied the eternal or the passing passions I saw and understood so well in others
BTS Many of them
BTS All had been arranged
BTS there you are the ship's precise location
BTS Back from the lip of the hole where ended the young man's obliterated trial Carlson put on the shoes and walked away to the left
BTS It is in line with evolution
BTS I winked off just this very minute sir
BTS I had a feeling no I don't know what I'm talking about
BTS She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess
BTS But as I turned to go I noted that his head had resumed its rocking motion
BTS I who had lived out of the whirl of the world had never dreamed that its work was carried on in such fashion
BTS You have specialized
BTS Then Ernest answered you and labor and all of us will be crushed under the iron heel of a despotism as relentless and terrible as any despotism that has blackened the pages of the history of man
BTS This fund became a sort of text-book that was passed on a part of the curriculum as it were of the school of Revolution
BTS Ernest saw in the affair the most sinister import
BTS It was an even toss whether the shark or we would get him and it was a matter of moments
BTS Tundra grass was impracticable
BTS To-morrow they were gone
BTS You have risen up as you to-day rise up shamelessly in our legislative halls and declared that profits were impossible without the toil of children and babes
BTS It is the darkness of death the ceasing to be the ceasing to feel the ceasing to move that is gathering about you descending upon you rising around you
BTS So he rendered fealty in the new way by running with the master's horse
BTS He ought not to be selfish but he will continue to be selfish as long as he lives in a social system that is based on pig-ethics
BTS Couldn't see
BTS I seemed to stand outside myself and to look at myself incredulously
BTS In his insistent crawling toward the light he discovered in her a nose that with a sharp nudge administered rebuke and later a paw that crushed him down and rolled him over and over with swift calculating stroke
BTS But the next instant she was warning him away from the cubs with a snarl that was less harsh than usual and that was more apologetic than menacing
BTS Even the wheel quite a deal higher than the waist was covered and swept again and again
BTS Van Weyden
BTS Only a few seconds elapsed before he was on his feet again
BTS Removing the wads from the latter with my knife I emptied the powder on a flat rock
BTS I can never bring myself to recognize anything else as valid
BTS All my heart seemed bursting with desire to fold my arms around him and to rest his head on my breast--his head that must be weary with so many thoughts
BTS Because of this new feeling within him he ofttimes elected discomfort and pain for the sake of his god
BTS Francois called Buck to him threw his arms around him wept over him
BTS I'll bet he has no appetite for supper I heard Wolf Larsen's voice which came to me from around the corner of the galley
BTS He really never crystallized mentally
BTS Industries were working short time
BTS He watched them closely as they shouldered the luggage and were led off down the hill by Matt who carried the bedding and the grip
BTS Nor can I quite close my ears to a small voice of pride which tells me I did not do so badly all things considered
BTS I like you too well to hurt you he said softly nay there was a tenderness and a caress in his voice that made me wince
BTS As the track led his way he followed prepared to meet the maker of it at every turn of the stream
BTS Next he must act for the benefit of his children
BTS Once in a gust the rail dipped under the sea and the decks on that side were for the moment awash with water that made a couple of the hunters hastily lift their feet
BTS Though she betrayed it by no outward sign I felt somehow that she was greatly perturbed
BTS nor were they again indiscreet enough to interrupt
BTS The swift changes in our industrial system are causing equally swift changes in our religious political and social structures
BTS Strike-breakers--these were in purpose and practice and everything except name the private soldiers of the capitalists
BTS But in two days' time they dropped down the Yukon bank from the Barracks loaded with letters for the outside
BTS The end of each movement was the accent of the rhythm the movement ending abruptly and the growling rising with a jerk
BTS The hunters fell silent as clams
BTS For your living
BTS When Grey Beaver tied the thong around his neck and passed the end of the thong into Beauty Smith's keeping White Fang knew that it was his god's will for him to go with Beauty Smith
BTS They might have been granite for all the light and warmth of a human soul they contained
BTS And on the top of it all the mob comes along and kills you too
BTS That's a ferry-boat of some sort the new-comer said indicating a whistle off to the right
BTS If the situation is unpleasing you compromise with your conscience when you make yourself a party to it
BTS I can close my eyes now and hear it drip drop drip drop all about me
BTS You could not help yourself
BTS With his rifle in the broad daylight it might be possible for him to awe the wolves and save the dog
BTS and it was with a great relief that I again emerged on deck and went aft to the cabin
BTS If you think I'm a thief just keep it to yerself or you'll find 'ow bloody well mistyken you are
BTS Everybody stole property from everybody else
BTS Before him sitting silently on their haunches were five live things the like of which he had never seen before
BTS He could do nothing and he could not understand
BTS And furthermore I dare to say to you now that when I have finished you will not answer
BTS You are afraid of him now
BTS This was promptly declared unconstitutional by the Luzerne County Court on the ground that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment in that it discriminated between individuals of the same class--namely children above fourteen years of age and children below
BTS Thus the farmers were compelled to borrow more and more while they were prevented from paying back old loans
BTS The bottom's likely to drop out at any moment
BTS I was one of those seeds
BTS There was nothing else for them to do
BTS But not by buzzing will we crush the bear Mr
BTS But what can you do
BTS But it was not till the third day that we found them all of them the shears included and of all perilous places in the pounding surf of the grim south-western promontory
BTS But nothing I could do seemed to relieve him
BTS Anyway you've got some explanations to make
BTS Two other dead guards marked his trail through the prison to the outer walls and he had killed with his hands to avoid noise
BTS He gave her a quick look of admiration
BTS so my sisters and father had called me during my childhood
BTS You see you fellows have studied business in a small way but you have not studied social evolution at all
BTS and when in the moment of his indecision Collie nipped him and scampered off he turned and followed after
BTS His chosen field was physics and in addition he did much original research and was greatly distinguished as a scientist
BTS Then he gathered up the marmalade and underclothes and put them on the table
BTS The sled swayed and trembled half-started forward
BTS Perhaps it is his headache I said
BTS Sons of the one mother though they were they were as different as day and night
BTS Man is a natural gambler and life is the biggest stake he can lay
BTS I shook my head
BTS Oilskins and sea-boots were hanging from the walls and here and there rifles and shotguns rested securely in the racks
BTS Indeed it was a safe refuge
BTS But she heard also that other and louder call the call of the fire and of man the call which has been given alone of all animals to the wolf to answer to the wolf and the wild-dog who are brothers
BTS Here and there he could see one curled up in the snow like a dog taking the sleep that was now denied himself
BTS Several times during the night he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open expecting to see the Judge or the boys at least
BTS There came a day in this land of plenty when the wolf-pack split in half and went in different directions
BTS The old primal melancholy was strong upon him
BTS Both men had lost hope Johnson because of temperamental despondency
BTS Henry thought long over it before he went to sleep and as his eyelids fluttered down and he dozed off the thought in his mind was There's no mistakin' it Bill's almighty blue
BTS How could I explain my idealism to this man
BTS I am compelled to Mister him and to Sir him with every speech
BTS and his eyes were restless fluttering here there and everywhere and refusing to meet mine
BTS There were not enough squirrels
BTS I asked
BTS Hump he said I beg pardon Mr
BTS By means of a secondary tackle I had attached to the shears I swung the boom to a nearly perpendicular position then lowered the butt to the deck where to prevent slipping I spiked great cleats around it
BTS Where did you go to school
BTS You must have been overboard sir
BTS All was garmented by vegetation from tiny maiden-hair and gold-back ferns to mighty redwood and Douglas spruces
BTS Go on they urged and Dr
BTS He was undoubtedly a great genius
BTS You cannot bankrupt him
BTS And in the course of the long journey with Grey Beaver he walked softly indeed amongst the full-grown dogs in the camps of the strange man-animals they encountered
BTS And yet here you are at the top of your life where diminishing and dying begin living an obscure and sordid existence hunting sea animals for the satisfaction of woman's vanity and love of decoration revelling in a piggishness to use your own words which is anything and everything except splendid
BTS Whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon
BTS Francois was obdurate but when he turned his back Buck again displaced Sol-leks who was not at all unwilling to go
BTS It was indeed a twisted smile for it was on the left side only the facial muscles of the right side moving not at all
BTS Instead of being crushed by the machines life will be made fairer and happier and nobler by them
BTS They were thoroughly organized and well armed and they were held in readiness to be hurled in special trains to any part of the country where labor went on strike or was locked out by the employers
BTS Serve out plenty of whisky to the hunters and see that a few bottles slip for'ard
BTS And to be imprisoned for the rest of my life amid scenes of screaming madness
BTS Then I saw Henderson leaping like a madman for the main rigging up which he shot on the inside till he was many feet higher than my head
BTS True he was a god but a most savage god
BTS It was out of these secret agents of the employers that the Black Hundreds arose
BTS Prosperity always brought calamity
BTS Bishop Morehouse is right
BTS The air was filled with oaths and indecent expressions
BTS The commotion caused the circle of eyes to shift restlessly for a moment and even to withdraw a bit but it settled down again as the dogs became quiet
BTS In the meantime the rabbit danced above them in the air
BTS He paused and looked at her
BTS As he stopped to meet me he betrayed a certain slight awkwardness that was strangely at variance with his bold-looking eyes and his firm sure hand that clasped for a moment in greeting
BTS Mr
BTS He had opened up for me the world of the real of which I had known practically nothing and from which I had always shrunk
BTS Japan dominated the East and took to herself the whole Asiatic portion of the world-market with the exception of India
BTS But he still lives she answered infinite faith in her voice
BTS Though like Everhard they did not dream of the nature of it there were men even before his time who caught glimpses of the shadow
BTS Buck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell upon him
BTS I ought to make the tackle fast at the point of balance
BTS I'll furnish you with cloth needles and thread he added
BTS The crime of not earning a living in their case is called vagrancy
BTS father asked and his face showed that he was interested rather than frightened
BTS CHAPTER XVIII IN THE SHADOW OF SONOMA Of myself during this period there is not much to say
BTS Mr
BTS He had neither whip nor club nor weapon
BTS It is combination versus competition a thousand centuries long struggle in which competition has always been worsted
BTS Jackson I could not escape
BTS So I did not wait a second time for Maud to send me
BTS The woman's arms went out and clutched the master around the neck a hostile act
BTS One hand was torn loose from its hold
BTS Every one here except me is hanging on your lips for that answer
BTS In spite of taking in washing she got behind in her rent
BTS Kowalt asked
BTS I was incapable of speaking my mind was too confused
BTS You can do it
BTS How much did the other mug get
BTS After each repulse when the old wolf sheered abruptly away from the sharp-toothed object of his desire he shouldered against a young three-year-old that ran on his blind right side
BTS But she did not kill Donnelly
BTS All the dogs is licking him
BTS And because of that I want you to know my fullest value I want to redeem in your eyes some small measure of my unworthiness
BTS Well
BTS One hand he held tightly against his side and behind him he left a bloody trail
BTS White Fang drove in upon it but his own shoulder was high above while he struck with such force that his momentum carried him on across over the other's body
BTS If I was I wouldn't be on the outside starving and taking cases like Jackson's
BTS that is why sir
BTS Buck as was his custom was lying in a corner head on paws watching his master's every action
BTS Thomas Mugridge on the other hand considered it a laughable affair and was continually bobbing his head out the galley door to make jocose remarks
BTS The last news I heard of him was that he had been sent to Boston or New Haven
BTS Day after day for days unending Buck toiled in the traces
BTS The three-year-old grew too ambitious in his fierceness
BTS Also he worked at odd jobs and the work was play as well as learned investigation for he delighted in it and was always returning home with copious notes and bubbling over with new adventures
BTS Let me answer Colonel Van Gilbert
BTS They were active
BTS You are even more stupid than the stupid workmen of England
BTS Her eyes fell before his gaze but she lifted them again and defiantly to mine
BTS Ernest was all fire and aliveness on the instant
BTS And I shall protest
BTS A little rope-work sail-making and experience with storms and such things and by the end of the voyage you could ship on any coasting schooner
BTS It would show our strength and give confidence
BTS One must become so adept as to deceive oneself
BTS There were seals about us and I was prepared to sight a sealing-schooner at any time
BTS Ever experienced it Mr
BTS And after this his crucifixion
BTS The great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns and the shambling trot grew weak and weaker
BTS It just comes to me she said that Captain Larsen was telling me how the men raided the rookeries
BTS Of all situations this was the most inconceivable
BTS Johansen called out to Harrison to go out the halyards
BTS Maud insisted on relieving me but proved that she had not the strength to steer in a heavy sea even if she could have gained the wisdom on such short notice
BTS You read the consciousness of life that it is alive
BTS But he was foredoomed and he went down with the she-wolf tearing savagely at his throat and with other teeth fixed everywhere upon him devouring him alive before ever his last struggles ceased or his last damage had been wrought
BTS It might have been that he took no notice because he was heavy with sleep
BTS They became villeins in short--serfs bound to the soil by a living wage
BTS How much of this can labor buy back
BTS His fevered membranes and burnt stomach began to clamour for more and more of the scorching fluid
BTS Oh Cooky
BTS She nodded her head
BTS They swung out on the trail with remarkable lack of exertion turned their heads uneasily and stopped in surprise
BTS He described the international organization of the socialists that united the million and a half in the United States with the twenty-three millions and a half in the rest of the world
BTS First name
BTS Let me briefly go over the ground with you again Ernest said
BTS He too had taken the part of the lowly and oppressed and against all the established power of priest and pharisee
BTS Morgan so potent though it may be added they need his brains more than he needs their votes-- at present and the combination of the two constitutes in large measure the 'community of interest
BTS I did not turn my head though I expected every moment a killing blow from the human brute behind me
BTS But I take the money under protest he added
BTS Already the passport system modelled on the Russian was developing
BTS And does it not also control copper to say nothing of running a smelter trust as a little side enterprise
BTS In the other hand he held a bottle which from time to time was inverted above his head to the accompaniment of gurgling noises
BTS Dave and Sol-leks alone were unaltered though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling
BTS In his puppyhood under the persecution of Lip-lip and the puppy-pack and in his fighting days with Beauty Smith he had acquired a fixed aversion for dogs
BTS but we worked together
BTS The fifty- two socialist Congressmen were confined in military fortresses scattered all over the United States
BTS He spurned him savagely with his foot
BTS They did not despise him
BTS Did you see that one
BTS The big bull was beset on every side
BTS You are my Avis he said and you are also some one else
BTS He snarled involuntarily as he felt her teeth in his shoulder but beyond this made no offer to hurt her
BTS But now he was tied with a chain that defied his teeth and he strove in vain by lunging to draw the staple from the timber into which it was driven
BTS 3 Harriman with Frick for counsel and Odell as political lieutenant controlling the central continental Southwestern and Southern Pacific Coast lines of transportation
BTS So it was when the doom of fifty years of living death was uttered by Judge Scott that Jim Hall hating all things in the society that misused him rose up and raged in the court-room until dragged down by half a dozen of his blue-coated enemies
BTS And still you struggle in my grip
BTS The people of that age were phrase slaves
BTS The greater the odds the greater the thrill
BTS For reply I twisted weakly into a sitting posture and was helped by Yonson to my feet
BTS Still calmly though my heart was going pitapat I pulled out Louis's dirk and began to whet it on the stone
BTS In his ears the camp-sounds and cries were ringing loud
BTS On a given day all the farmers in a locality would assemble and sweep across the country in converging lines driving the rabbits by scores of thousands into a prepared enclosure where they were clubbed to death by men and boys
BTS It was the straightaway now and when it came to real running White Fang could teach her things
BTS This growl he could not suppress
BTS she burst out a moment later
BTS At first the machine bosses charged the master capitalists extortionate tolls for legislation
BTS At the end of that time the lynx was devoured while the she-wolf's wounds had healed sufficiently to permit her to take the meat-trail again
BTS This occurred in 2138 A
BTS You couldn't get it in if you paid ten times the regular advertising rates
BTS We showed it our power in the general strike
BTS Within half an hour after leaving the train I was on board a small fishing boat and out on the waters of San Francisco Bay
BTS You have read Darwin I said
BTS An' Ol' Villan cried like a baby
BTS And if you make a mess of it it will be the last you ever make
BTS And after such classification he avoided the things that hurt the restrictions and restraints in order to enjoy the satisfactions and the remunerations of life
BTS she asked
BTS There was much to interest him
BTS I know my position is perilous and I may say frankly that yours is even more perilous
BTS and this made his damnation certain
BTS Partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the forest
BTS The ptarmigan struggled against him showering blows upon him with her free wing
BTS It had come down to him from a remote ancestry through a thousand thousand lives
BTS Buck made no effort
BTS When he laughs it is from a humour that is nothing else than ferocious
BTS a truck carried him with an assortment of boxes and parcels upon a ferry steamer
BTS but as he had no knowledge of the wide world outside he was never oppressed by the narrow confines of his existence
BTS They were the saviours of humanity and they regarded themselves as heroic and sacrificing laborers for the highest good
BTS But one lived Timothy and him his father considered dead because he had taken service with the Iron Heel in the Mercenaries
BTS A wild scream of fear and anguish hastened them
BTS Mercedes screamed cried laughed and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria
BTS He too was lying on his side
BTS Night had fallen
BTS Even the big beating given him in his puppyhood by Grey Beaver was mild compared with this
BTS We left the old town of Sonoma to the right and rode up a canyon that lay between outlying buttresses of the mountain
BTS I thought as much
BTS Varying were the emotions that surged through him
BTS Often and often her last-reserve force gone I have seen her stretched flat on her back on the sand in the way she had of resting and recuperating
BTS Our
BTS I had time to notice that the pockets of the dead man had been emptied on the deck and that his body and his grin had been wrapped from view in canvas the folds of which the sailor Johansen was sewing together with coarse white twine shoving the needle through with a leather contrivance fitted on the palm of his hand
BTS I looked at Wolf Larsen
BTS Not only is it inevitable that you small capitalists shall pass away but it is inevitable that the large capitalists and the trusts also shall pass away
BTS In places the stone facing of the building was torn away exposing the iron construction beneath
BTS A hundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest Police with fifty dogs huskies all who joined the chase
BTS while to show mercy was a weakness
BTS A shout from Francois hailed his appearance
BTS We can do it I amended
BTS Here lend me a hand before you pull your freight he added
BTS But scarcely had the cheer of its light departed than he went into camp
BTS Not a soul escaped not even the guards
BTS I'll show you Ernest said quietly
BTS The smallest fee he would deign to notice was a hundred thousand dollars
BTS There lies your strength and your value--to the capitalist class
BTS Calling us weak does not make you stronger in the face of the strength of the Plutocracy Ernest retorted
BTS I am to receive a handsome fee--two hundred and fifty dollars--as befits the man who though a radical once ran for governor
BTS and even then they were lying down at a distance apparently oblivious of his existence
BTS You know that your strength is an empty shell
BTS All the world is quiet but it is the quiet before the storm
BTS It was not that they were stunned
BTS What is the matter
BTS They are strong hands
BTS And through it all with a serenity and certitude that was terrifying continued to rise the form of that monster of the ages the Oligarchy
BTS I countered
BTS Van Weyden there he replied nodding to me with a mischievous twinkle
BTS Your wife and children
BTS Editorial policy he said
BTS Different from the Mackenzie toboggans were the Klondike sleds with runners under them
BTS I never heard a voice I hated so
BTS His face was serious
BTS If our five boats do as well as you and I have done we'll have a pretty full crew Wolf Larsen said to me
BTS The vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more frequently now that there was little work to be done
BTS Of course the Iron Heel kept the figures secret but at a very conservative estimate at least one hundred and thirty thousand Mercenaries were slain
BTS CHAPTER XXIV Among the most vivid memories of my life are those of the events on the Ghost which occurred during the forty hours succeeding the discovery of my love for Maud Brewster
BTS Then speech poured from him
BTS White Fang became hated by man and dog
BTS Wolf Larsen and Johansen were all about the poor fellow
BTS The life of only one member was demanded which was a remoter interest than their lives and in the end they were content to pay the toll
BTS Time and again the impulse surged over White Fang and each time as he yielded to it he was checked by the master's voice
BTS As it was spray and spume came aboard in such quantities that I bailed without cessation
BTS the lynx might have been frozen to marble
BTS A whisper of the gold-rush had reached his ears and he had come with several bales of furs and another of gut-sewn mittens and moccasins
BTS I asked
BTS Ernest smiled
BTS I should not have been surprised if the wet black beard had frizzled and curled and flared up in smoke and flame
BTS Buck received them in comradely fashion Dave ignored them while Spitz proceeded to thrash first one and then the other
BTS Then he discovered his mistake and tried to placate her
BTS I know it I said hoarsely
BTS then he suppressed the whimper for fear that it might attract the attention of the lurking dangers
BTS With iron hand and iron heel it mastered the surging millions out of confusion brought order out of the very chaos wrought its own foundation and structure
BTS The Macedonia was now but a mile away the black smoke pouring from her funnel at a right angle so madly she raced pounding through the sea at a seventeen-knot gait 'Sky-hooting through the brine as Wolf Larsen quoted while gazing at her
BTS In spite of his belief in it he worked like a giant against it and he more than any man has made possible the revolt that even now waits the signal to burst forth
BTS White Fang fought willingly enough but he was outclassed
BTS Every instinct of his nature would have impelled him to dash wildly away had there not suddenly and for the first time arisen in him another and counter instinct
BTS Then he perceived that they were very little and he became bolder
BTS For I had come to see a malignant devil in him which impelled him to hate all the world
BTS And when I had expended some thirty shells for three seals I decided that the ammunition would be exhausted before I acquired the necessary knowledge
BTS The cook quailed under it
BTS Remember this surplus is over and above trade which articles of trade have been consumed
BTS After watching the balloon attack Ernest took me down into the heart of the building where I slept the afternoon out and the night
BTS Mr
BTS The wind puffed strongly and the Ghost heeled far over burying her lee rail
BTS In the industrial warfare of that time profit-sharing had been tried
BTS Jones and Philip Ward who had already risen from their chairs led the Bishop off the platform while the audience sat breathless and shocked
BTS I was hurt
BTS Why does the United States lag behind
BTS I was peeling potatoes
BTS They were shot with their backs to the firing squad
BTS She must be a pretty old woman now he said staring meditatively into the binnacle and then jerking a sharp glance at Harrison who was steering a point off the course
BTS Weedon Scott some one answered
BTS I have lived it day and night utterly and for so long that it is ever present in my mind
BTS If he didn't bankrupt me with damaged suits the authorities would take him away from me and electrocute him
BTS May be there were other ptarmigan hens
BTS Buck was wildly glad
BTS The right of masters to dispose of the time of their slaves has been distinctly recognized by the Creator of all things who is surely at liberty to vest the right of property over any object whomsoever He pleases
BTS And when it did get its teeth into him it did not hold on but let go instantly and darted away again
BTS I shall not forget you when my clothes are dry
BTS He was beginning to see red in whatever direction he looked
BTS Wolf Larsen demanded
BTS I pulled till I burst open the ends of all my fingers
BTS It was those cursed headaches brought it on
BTS And truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate raging at their heels and dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees
BTS And rescue us from ourselves she completed with a most adorable smile whimsical as I had never seen it for it was whimsical with love
BTS To escape death he would have done anything and the police agents prepared him by assuring him that he could not possibly escape conviction of murder in the first degree when his trial came off
BTS CHAPTER XXVIII There is no need of going into an extended recital of our suffering in the small boat during the many days we were driven and drifted here and there willy-nilly across the ocean
BTS I wish I were going to be there
BTS Friend and foe are all mixed up
BTS Once he got up and walked over to the trough for a drink of water
BTS Then Buck sprang in and out
BTS What remains to you over and above Ernest interrupted to ask would roughly be the equivalent of your salary as a manager did the railroad own the quarry
BTS I warned you before about it
BTS It was necessary that I should be completely lost if ever I was to see Ernest again for by trailing me after he escaped he would be caught once more
BTS It was a deer-hound rushing upon him
BTS It was busy arming itself with the rifles of the slain and killing the wounded
BTS Dub was badly injured in a hind leg
BTS We're sick of strikes
BTS Three to one
BTS Peter Donnelly the scab foreman at the Sierra Mills whom I encountered while investigating the case of Jackson was a surprise to all of us
BTS And this time he was beaten even more severely than before
BTS It is plain that his mother is Kiche
BTS Ballingford announced pompously
BTS Already the canoes were departing and some had disappeared down the river
BTS There was a query in her voice and she faced me accusingly as though I were guilty of the deed or at least a party to it
BTS If the United States becomes too hot for us why I have qualified for citizenship in Turkey
BTS He was manifestly distressed by my coming
BTS And hand in hand with this Ernest and the other leaders were hard at work reorganizing the forces of the Revolution
BTS No you don't
BTS And all cursed him and told terrible tales of his brutality
BTS the dog-musher exploded
BTS The result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel
BTS But he had early discovered that one wall of his world was different from the rest
BTS His jaws closed on the hand nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once more
BTS And those who do know whisper that the hunters while excellent shots were so notorious for their quarrelsome and rascally proclivities that they could not sign on any decent schooner
BTS but therefore the more outrage to his dignity and his anger waxed and waxed
BTS In no other way can be explained our sacrifices and martyrdoms
BTS As a class they disciplined themselves
BTS It was as successful as it was selfish and out of it was coined the word arthurization to denote grab-sharing on the part of labor unions
BTS He was beset on either side by the merciless fangs of his erstwhile comrades
BTS He seemed possessed by an insatiable fury which gave no time for grief
BTS Could it be that some glimmer of vision remained to him
BTS I bent over and took it from his pocket
BTS the labor castes and the Oligarchy will crumble away
BTS When the canoe touched the shore White Fang lay whimpering and motionless waiting the will of Grey Beaver
BTS Oh it was done very nicely I'll allow
BTS and old One Eye might have been dead
BTS Kiche was a remote memory
BTS Oh don't mind me he said with a self-depreciatory wave of his hand
BTS and the dogs grew excited and frightened and were guilty of panics that tangled the traces and further depressed the two men
BTS Jim Hall was being rail-roaded to prison for a crime he had not committed
BTS He was beaten he knew that
BTS Hardly
BTS Those of us in the higher employ of the Iron Heel were to proceed immediately to make confusion and anarchy in all our departments
BTS Serve you bloody well right if yer neck was broke
BTS There was no opposing them
BTS And is not my brother dead
BTS It drew him as the light in the mouth of the cave had drawn him in his early puppyhood
BTS It was through no special eagerness for more gains that the Rockefellers began to branch out from oil into other things
BTS His wrenched shoulder-blade untreated and unrested went from bad to worse till finally Hal shot him with the big Colt's revolver
BTS So acute did his hunger become at times that he was not above rooting out wood-mice from their burrows in the ground
BTS and it remained for us on the outside to do it
BTS I put the shovel away and calmly sat down on the coal-box facing him
BTS If you say so I'll turn and go back
BTS A gust of overpowering rage swept over him
BTS Thank you sir he said very gratefully and very humbly indeed
BTS I don't think they'd insure me at all
BTS I had quite forgotten the existence of Leach and Johnson when suddenly like a thunderclap Boat ho
BTS That night the hounds were out and there was little sleep in the refuge
BTS He is too ethical
BTS But his demeanour toward me was more ferocious than ever
BTS The Outsides were timid and frightened the Insides without confidence in their masters
BTS You see they're sure of us only they know they've got to wait to get us
BTS Philosophy is-- Dr
BTS You are a millionaire in immortality and a millionaire whose fortune cannot be lost whose fortune is less perishable than the stars and as lasting as space or time
BTS Two hours of terrible work followed in which all hands of us two hunters three sailors Wolf Larsen and I reefed first one and then the other the jib and mainsail
BTS See all is ready
BTS The dogs worked in single file one behind another hauling on double traces
BTS In addition he was immensely wealthy
BTS The hunter and boat-puller were both lying awkwardly in the bottom but the boat-steerer lay across the gunwale half in and half out his arms trailing in the water and his head rolling from side to side
BTS The Valkyries were women
BTS He spent half the day extending his campfire to the tree at any moment a half dozen burning faggots ready at hand to fling at his enemies
BTS But this knowledge stopped with the working class
BTS All hands were asleep
BTS But his father was a wolf
BTS Six
BTS You are right young man
BTS Smoke ho
BTS The years of prosperity were now to be paid for
BTS He could do nothing to defend himself
BTS You do not understand the combination that has been effected
BTS she asked
BTS In the Wild the time of a mother with her young is short
BTS In a category by itself is the deliberate burning and destruction of capitalist property by the capitalists themselves
BTS It is the brain of the Plutocracy that controls the government and this brain consists of seven small and powerful groups of men
BTS I came on deck after a good night's rest in spite of my poor knee to find the Ghost foaming along wing-and-wing and every sail drawing except the jibs with a fresh breeze astern
BTS It meant a fight
BTS I was famished but Maud tried vainly to get me to eat
BTS I don't care to undertake the herding of one of those harems I objected

BTS Garthwaite did the talking at first but I was compelled to undergo a brief examination to prove service with the Iron Heel

BTS Poor devil Scott murmured pityingly
BTS But blimey if I cared
BTS We both laughed at the absurdity and he dropped down to the deck and rested his rifle across the rail
BTS So that was the way
BTS You want to come aboard eh
BTS I could see the pilot-house and a white-bearded man leaning partly out of it on his elbows
BTS He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and said Then you're thinkin' as it was  A long wailing cry fiercely sad from somewhere in the darkness had interrupted him
BTS It would not require a Sherlock Holmes to deduce that you have been cooking over a camp-fire to say nothing of trying out seal-blubber
BTS The she-wolf was less than a yard from him
BTS As though animated by a common impulse the onlookers drew back to a respectful distance
BTS He had evidently gone below
BTS Heads nodded around the table in affirmation
BTS Again he wandered about through the great camp looking for them and again he returned
BTS Just as your class dragged down the old feudal nobility so shall it be dragged down by my class the working class
BTS In as few words as possible he began Spencer puts it something like this First a man must act for his own benefit to do this is to be moral and good
BTS Then came the long sniff as White Fang reassured himself that his god was still inside and had not yet taken himself off in mysterious and solitary flight
BTS He knew the hands of the gods their proved mastery their cunning to hurt
BTS Ernest was speaking
BTS The frightened household clustered at the top of the stairway
BTS I'll give you the mathematics of my dream
BTS The Bishop black as a coal-heaver in a workingman's cheap cotton shirt one button was missing from the throat and in overalls
BTS Even as he sank the soldier fired again and Milford doubled in then flung his body out and fell sprawling
BTS The bepuzzlement in their faces was delicious
BTS but it was elective for the threatened blow did not descend
BTS The onlookers laughed uproariously and he felt ashamed he knew not why for it was his first snow
BTS The steel acquired a razor edge
BTS They're the cause of more trouble
BTS Do you remember not so long ago when our regular army was only fifty thousand
BTS Van Weyden how far we are off the coast and what the bearings of Yokohama are
BTS Why man it's living
BTS Kowalt
BTS So the Trust took your profits away from you Ernest said and you've gone into politics in order to legislate the Trust out of existence and get the profits back
BTS and the Ghost heeled about on the port tack with practically no noise at all
BTS Here he removed the shoes and still hiding trail for a distance at last put on his own shoes
BTS Rivers and streams that entered the main river he forded or swam
BTS Yet White Fang was never effusively affectionate
BTS No chance at all Henry concluded
BTS I would work my will through it all in spite of Wolf Larsen and of my own thirty-five bookish years
BTS The broad pads of his feet were bruised and bleeding
BTS Father reported with glee Dr
BTS That phrase the one small woman startled me like an electric shock
BTS He had no abstract ideas about justice and fair play
BTS The difference worked in my status brought about a corresponding difference in treatment from him
BTS Baseek was old and already he had come to know the increasing valour of the dogs it had been his wont to bully
BTS Now the unknown had caught tight hold of him

BTS She turned and looked me in the eyes
BTS this exultation of life
BTS We were sailing on through the fog without a look-out and without lights
BTS Too many bitter strikes had been curbed there in the days of capitalism for the workers to forget and forgive
BTS I did not watch him and it was not until he was back beside me and we were speeding on that he said It was Bishop Morehouse
BTS Besides this god had no club no whip no firearm
BTS But why is it policy
BTS The quotation here follows About ten years ago Rockefeller's income was given as thirty millions by an excellent authority
BTS The next he knew he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance
BTS He was a beardless young fellow a cadet evidently of some great oligarch family
BTS Takes more'n a handful of them pesky critters to do for yours truly Bill my son
BTS She too rendered submission to the man-animals
BTS After that he mourned gently when the gods were around
BTS We fled hand in hand down the bloody pavement slipping and sliding and making for the corner
BTS I really saw nothing of the heroic work done by the comrades
BTS The champagne is already flat
BTS In attempting to recover himself he reached for the iron railing which surrounded the stove and kept the pots from sliding off
BTS he demanded back
BTS The moment before we had been leaping through the sunshine the clear sky above us the sea breaking and rolling wide to the horizon and a ship vomiting smoke and fire and iron missiles rushing madly upon us
BTS It's those damn headaches I believe
BTS But when the ends of the rope were placed in the stranger's hands he growled menacingly
BTS Scott asked
BTS were the cries that arose
BTS What are you going to do
BTS Through the open door he could catch glimpses of the luggage on the floor
BTS All the devil that was in him challenged the devil in Wolf Larsen
BTS There was no levity in it
BTS There was a great snarling and growling and over all arose a smashing and crashing of furniture and glass
BTS but to-day she stands in imperishable bronze in the Pantheon of Brotherhood in the wonder city of Serles
BTS They worked together more smoothly and steadily
BTS I don't understand I lied for I thoroughly understood
BTS A kind word a caressing touch of the hand on the part of Grey Beaver might have sounded these deeps
BTS What do you believe then
BTS He at least after the customary agonizing of youth found content and made of his materialism a joyous thing
BTS He laughed brutally and I was driven to the Bishop's defence
BTS It might have been Grecian it might have been Roman only it was a shade too massive for the one a shade too delicate for the other
BTS When all was ready the word hard-a-lee was passed forward to me from man to man
BTS Buck was no less eager and no less cautious as he likewise circled back and forth for the advantage
BTS You may have very good reasons for forgetting your name and I'll like you none the worse for it as long as you toe the mark
BTS It was deadly fighting
BTS We cannot forbear giving the following remarkable page from the history of the times to show how the need for reinvestment of the Standard Oil surplus crushed out small capitalists and hastened the breakdown of the capitalist system
BTS And it was a beating
BTS And yet he remained somehow different from other dogs
BTS It would never do
BTS And if it storms
BTS From somewhere far to the south the dull sound of an explosion came to our ears
BTS And break it out
BTS Then she dropped her eyes to lift them again laughing
BTS They reminded him of children gathered about a spread table and awaiting permission to begin to eat
BTS The fact that this act and thousands of similar acts went unpunished goes to show how completely the judiciary was the creature of the Plutocracy
BTS I hoped desperately that he might commit some hostile act attempt to strike me or choke me
BTS Buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled
BTS And yet I am all here Hump he wrote with a final flourish
BTS The day's events had prepared him for the unknown to manifest itself in most stupendous and unthinkable ways
BTS It is useless I answered
BTS They invariably paid rent and considering the value of such houses enormous rent to the landlords
BTS Also he explained that there were many accidents in the mills and that the company's policy was to fight to the bitter end all consequent damage suits
BTS For the Love of a Man When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson
BTS Insolent
BTS At the end of six months my loneliness was broken by the arrival of two comrades
BTS And though I had been surrounded by women all my days my appreciation of them had been aesthetic and nothing more
BTS And in the meanwhile the she-wolf the cause of it all sat down contentedly on her haunches and watched
BTS I amused myself with running over in my mind the sum of the fortunes represented and it ran well into the hundreds of millions
BTS Is it a bit more absurd than what you advocate you machine-breaker returning to the antediluvian ways of your forefathers
BTS As the hand descended closer and closer there raged within the cub a battle of the instincts
BTS They were slashed open and bleeding before they knew what had happened were whipped almost before they had begun to fight
BTS Buck swung to the right ending the movement in a plunge that took up the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty pounds
BTS I proceeded to experiment lashing and wedging the steering-oar until the boat held on fairly well by the wind without my assistance
BTS But in spite of this great love he bore John Thornton which seemed to bespeak the soft civilizing influence the strain of the primitive which the Northland had aroused in him remained alive and active
BTS Members of the favored unions told their wives and the wives gossiped and soon all the labor world knew what had happened
BTS And there were so many of the people of the abyss
BTS Watch out for squalls is all I can say to you was Louis's warning given during a spare half-hour on deck while Wolf Larsen was engaged in straightening out a row among the hunters
BTS Twenty-nine per cent of those in occupations are from the middle class and they own twenty-five per cent of the total wealth
BTS But Beauty Smith kept a wary eye on him and the club was held always ready to strike
BTS He had never dreamed that his own kind consisted of more than One Eye his mother and himself
BTS One look at you'd be enough
BTS The last tie was broken
BTS Her face was white her eyes dilated with horror
BTS Before he had known the gods she had been to him the centre-pin of the universe
BTS For the most part however Buck's love was expressed in adoration
BTS But why should you bring about the crucifixion of the Bishop
BTS In point of fact it was merely a dinner for business men--small business men of course
BTS He struck me as stupid and yet the deftness with which he worked with his one hand seemed to belie his stupidity
BTS With a groan of pain he threw himself into a doorway
BTS You're a beast
BTS for in such way only I knew I could be stirred to shoot
BTS It is good for one to possess it
BTS Command followed command
BTS This is the only copy of this publication that has come down to us and yet from its appearance and content we cannot but conclude that it was one of the popular periodicals with a large circulation
BTS It exploded right at my feet and yet it did not kill me
BTS That night we stood alternate watches one of us sleeping at a time
BTS Buck loosed his teeth from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat
BTS No mass-plays here
BTS After my interview with Smith I went to my father's office in the Chemistry Building and there encountered Ernest
BTS Oh I don't know
BTS He eluded their fangs
BTS But the effect of such a sentiment enunciated by two such powerful social arbiters I underestimated
BTS But she thrust him ignominiously away and behind her
BTS Lip-lip excited by the chase and by the persistent nearness of his victim forgot caution and locality
BTS so you live ignominiously untrue to the best you dream of sinning against your whole pitiful little code and if there were a hell heading your soul straight for it
BTS He followed him about at his work watched him while he ate saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning
BTS Also they held it a mercy since Dave was to die anyway that he should die in the traces heart-easy and content
BTS The days came and went streaming their unbroken sunshine over the Santa Clara Valley
BTS D'ye see them marks across the chest
BTS Magnificent roads will be built
BTS It was their belief that if ever they weakened the great beast would ingulf them and everything of beauty and wonder and joy and good in its cavernous and slime-dripping maw
BTS He shook his head
BTS I won't stand it he said
BTS Sleep-walking sunstroke what
BTS Where did you get that phrase
BTS Leach pleaded in the first interval of comparative silence
BTS It was their way
BTS I was asked
BTS Come on back you pore little mamma's darling
BTS For the Bishop was sane and pure and noble
BTS He was made into a broken-down beast by his masters the arch-beasts
BTS He began at the first bunks forward on the star-board side
BTS One chance in a thousand is really optimistic
BTS Not half so proud as I am of you nor with half the reason she answered looking me straight in the eyes for a moment with an expression in her own and a dancing tremulous light which I had not seen before and which gave me a pang of quick delight I know not why for I did not understand it
BTS Ernest waited
BTS Ernest queried
BTS The sleepers did not mind
BTS And she had found him or what remained of him at the end of the trail
BTS It was the one infallible token that I had not failed
BTS The faster he ran the faster ran the one he was after and the faster ran all the dogs
BTS And she was so much the woman clinging and appealing sunshine and dew to my manhood rooting it deeper and sending through it the sap of a new strength
BTS He was no figure-head
BTS The boss is kind
BTS This time there was no dissent
BTS I leaned despairingly over the rail watching the trim little schooner swiftly increasing the bleak sweep of ocean between us
BTS Fastening one end of a heavy tackle to the windlass and with the other end fast to the butt of the foretopmast I began to heave
BTS The old dog did not like it and showed plainly that he was afraid of Buck
BTS Some strong hand gripped my shoulder in the thick of the press and was dragging fiercely at me
BTS She gave me a quick look and again I caught that dancing tremulous light and something more in her eyes
BTS I studied her myself and though it was I who maintained the conversation I know that I was a bit shy not quite self-possessed
BTS I surely have hunted and forayed and fought all the days of my life
BTS I'm not saying that if I'd got the right kind of testimony out of their witnesses on cross-examination that friendship would have decided the case
BTS As in his cubhood he had been made to feel his smallness and puniness on the day he first came in from the Wild to the village of Grey Beaver so now in his full-grown stature and pride of strength he was made to feel small and puny
BTS Two hundred thousand machinists along with their five hundred thousand allies in the metalworking trades had been defeated in as bloody a strike as had ever marred the United States
BTS Thornton's doubt was strong in his face but his fighting spirit was aroused the fighting spirit that soars above odds fails to recognize the impossible and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle
BTS You have slept in soft beds and worn fine clothes and eaten good meals
BTS They know where their hides is safe he said
BTS In roar of shell and shrapnel and in whine of machine-guns will our answer be couched
BTS I should prefer going with you she said in a low voice in which there was just a hint of appeal
BTS An endless creaking was going on all about me the woodwork and the fittings groaning and squeaking and complaining in a thousand keys
BTS All day we sailed and all night and the next day and the next day after day the wind always astern and blowing steadily and strong
BTS Once they've got the habit and the taste of blood
BTS You've earned it was the young officer's answer
BTS Out of my experience with stewards on the Atlantic liners at the end of the voyage I could have sworn he was waiting for his tip
BTS The moment the sled started the team took after Lip-lip in a chase that extended throughout the day
BTS of the rough fare and rougher usage where kicks and blows were bed and breakfast and took the place of speech and fear and hatred and pain were my only soul-experiences
BTS It is the king of words--Power
BTS But it was only a way he had
BTS Did you feel that
BTS The purse I found but its contents with the exception of the small silver had been abstracted
BTS Whatever a sailor purchases is taken from his subsequent earnings on the sealing grounds
BTS I have often envied that young man of yours for his actual knowledge of the proletariat
BTS 'Do you remember what I told that socialist lover of your daughter's
BTS In all the days he had lived it had not worked so hard as on this one day
BTS Remember to-morrow is coming and you're so tired now that you can hardly stand
BTS His teeth closed upon the rabbit and he bore it back to earth with him
BTS And I suppose some one else makes your bed for you
BTS They could hardly have fared worse
BTS My muscles were small and soft like a woman's or so the doctors had said time and again in the course of their attempts to persuade me to go in for physical-culture fads
BTS Only by the steady regard of his eyes did he express his love and by the unceasing following with his eyes of his god's every movement
BTS Then he burst out By God
BTS and to his credit he gave more than he received
BTS I wouldn't stand for that he replied
BTS But there is Captain Larsen she objected
BTS Wolf Larsen treasured against them the attempt on his life and the drubbing he had received in the forecastle
BTS They were all terribly footsore
BTS Besides you have sinned
BTS When the train stopped at Sixteenth Street Station in Oakland we alighted and there Felice Van Verdighan with her two maids her lap-dog and her lap-dog's maid disappeared forever
BTS But we must be quick most quick and sure
BTS He skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt
BTS They cooked for the master and washed the dishes and did other things just as Matt had done up in the Klondike
BTS Very gently and somewhat suspiciously he first smelled the tallow and then proceeded to eat it
BTS He held out a small piece of meat
BTS Half-stunned by the blow Buck was knocked backward and the lash laid upon him again and again while Spitz soundly punished the many times offending Pike
BTS he questioned
BTS In front of me I could see the moving back of a man's coat
BTS By it White Fang knew whether he did right or not
BTS Hartman was jubilant
BTS Not sighted I answered
BTS Nature had been niggardly with him
BTS Something must be done Humphrey Maud said next morning when I had told her of the night's occurrence
BTS I looked instantly to Maud Brewster
BTS Three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair rippling and bristling It led straight toward camp and John Thornton
BTS I shook my head and regarded their work
BTS He studied the habits of the squirrel with greater carefulness and strove with greater craft to steal upon it and surprise it
BTS That is cheap
BTS What was I to do
BTS Of course this overproduction he mentions was the profits of the capitalist system over and beyond the consuming power of the capitalists
BTS Dave was wheeler or sled dog pulling in front of him was Buck then came Sol-leks
BTS I discovered her in the steerage by Wolf Larsen's bunk
BTS while Smoke and Henderson convalescent under a deck awning and swinging day and night in their hammocks assured me that I was better than any hospital nurse and that they would not forget me at the end of the voyage when they were paid off
BTS A change a great change is coming in society
BTS Nothing to disturb me
BTS He cleared his throat in embarrassment and I could see the sweat starting out on his forehead
BTS Maybe you'll abide here long enough to reconsider that statement Biedenbach said quietly
BTS It is the primitive strength it is the strength that is to life germane it is the strength that is stronger than wealth and that wealth cannot take away
BTS He raged and snarled at them or lay quietly and studied them with cold hatred
BTS I was unable to prevent it is a better way of phrasing it I replied still gently
BTS and yet such is the paradox I never wanted so much to live as right now when I place the least value upon my own life
BTS The railroad gets my profit
BTS No matches I groaned
BTS She was arrested and arraigned for insanity
BTS Possibly there is a station ashore
BTS It seemed that Johansen in his sleep lived over each night the events of the day
BTS Big things are happening secretly all around us
BTS It is the capitalist class that pays you that feeds you that puts the very clothes on your backs that you are wearing to-night
BTS As for Buck wearying of the pursuit he returned to the desolated camp
BTS Three yards away from Johnson he was and sitting down
BTS His right cheek was red with blood which flowed from some wound in the head
BTS It was not until her racket had faded away in the distance and died out that One Eye ventured forth
BTS Disguise had to be fundamental intrinsic part and parcel of one's being second nature
BTS I was compelled to repeat my question loudly before he answered Not all the time
BTS He saw clearly the futility of the Bishop's great soul as coming events were soon to show as clearly to me
BTS Now and again he resisted spasmodically and to no purpose
BTS I have faint memories of breaking a window and hiding in some shop to escape a street mob that was pursued by soldiers
BTS And then we came to the great hole
BTS Lip-lip was overthrown and rolled upon his back
BTS It was always his way to turn the point back upon an opponent and he did it now with a beaming brotherliness of face and utterance
BTS To be compelled to run away before the yelling pack every dog of which for three years he had thrashed and mastered was almost more than he could endure
BTS The cry of this army is 'No quarter
BTS Nay I answered it is you who are a brave woman
BTS So I lowered the big starboard anchor giving plenty of slack
BTS With the return of the love-master White Fang's recovery was rapid
BTS It was at this stage that Thomas Mugridge's erratic soul brought him into the scene
BTS Van Weyden who harps eternally on questions of right and wrong I'd ask by what right do you live when you do nothing to deserve living
BTS But they were too widely scattered over the country to advantage from their own strength
BTS A member of the 'Frisco Reds pledged himself to twelve annual executions
BTS It's ben fifty below for two weeks now
BTS He halted with equal abruptness and gasped
BTS He was beginning the ascent
BTS The soul of him was good and yet it was twisted and maimed and blunted by the savagery of his life
BTS Wolf Larsen was undisguised in his admiration
BTS For never was there such a lover as Ernest Everhard
BTS You called my speech fallacy
BTS But growth demanded disobedience
BTS Very good the Bishop interposed
BTS While a slaughter-house was made of the nation by the capitalist the Church was dumb
BTS He is living more royally than any man for'ard though he does not know it
BTS but the boat remained and Wolf Larsen made one more reckless effort to recover it
BTS There were no inequalities of surface
BTS Are you going to take the money
BTS But to return
BTS It has to be sold abroad
BTS Paltry isn't it
BTS She had her heart set on a trip to the country hard enough as it was
BTS he made a thousand per cent
BTS It never went entirely back to its normal shape and was called a cauliflower ear by the sailors
BTS It ran below its ordinary speed
BTS The drivers confidently expected a long stopover
BTS You are trespassing
BTS Kiche's greeting of her grown son was anything but affectionate
BTS He crawled tremblingly to his feet and stood whimpering
BTS I had always conceived a burial at sea to be a very solemn and awe-inspiring event but I was quickly disillusioned by this burial at any rate
BTS Now that I have him helpless helpless he shall remain
BTS He's roostin' in a tree at the last camp
BTS Morning found the man haggard and worn wide-eyed from want of sleep
BTS Better get in those topsails Mr
BTS He was not afraid but merely lazy
BTS What's your name boy
BTS It was a colossal plan--too colossal to be wrought by the genius of one man alone
BTS Maud made the discovery in the afternoon while trying to give him nourishment
BTS You must become another woman--and not merely in the clothes you wear but inside your skin under the clothes
BTS This he resented and when she stood shoulder to shoulder with him bristling and showing her teeth the aspiring solitary ones would back off turn-tail and continue on their lonely way
BTS All worked well but there came a time when he fastened the pine-knot insecurely
BTS Did it right before me
BTS The next moment I knew how it had happened
BTS The hands do not early get over the stiffness
BTS We arrived just at the conclusion of the trial of a spy
BTS Cabin-boy
BTS Buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the woman
BTS Your terms are rather vague Dr
BTS You might remove the handcuffs he said that night as we stood in consultation over him
BTS After a searching scrutiny the animal trotted forward a few steps
BTS Both sides of his neck and head were ripped and slashed
BTS Dr
BTS All of which served to make White Fang's days enjoyable
BTS And secondly the law was rushed through Congress and the Senate secretly with practically no discussion
BTS Yet this endurance he achieved
BTS I'm dividing amongst them a dollar a skin for all the skins shot by our new hunters
BTS The primitive deeps of my nature stirred
BTS The bottom had dropped out of the trail
BTS Pertonwaithe the two men who held most of the stock in the Sierra Mills
BTS For the living know that they shall die
BTS And so exalted upborne by a sense of power I turned my back on the howling inferno and climbed to the deck where the fog drifted ghostly through the night and the air was sweet and pure and quiet
BTS Well I am going to exercise my prerogative of roaring and show you how fares nobility
BTS I have had a visioning and I wish to forget
BTS Unless One Ear gnawed 'm loose
BTS On the 4th of December the American minister was withdrawn from the German capital
BTS and very much alive very much alive
BTS Anna Roylston carried out the execution
BTS With the hunters it was otherwise
BTS They did not move but sat there silent and ominous
BTS Then he began to whine
BTS He was surprised and looked at them in a puzzled way
BTS and then for some time he was silent
BTS It had played him a scurvy trick when it fashioned him into the thing he was and it had played him scurvy tricks ever since
BTS Ernest paused for a moment and regarded him thoughtfully noting his face dark and twisted with anger his panting chest his writhing body and his slim white hands nervously clenching and unclenching
BTS Mugridge sir he fawned his effeminate features running into a greasy smile
BTS Grey Beaver's wrath was terrible
BTS he asked
BTS It is impossible for you to diminish your principal
BTS His instructions were too clear for me to make a mistake
BTS eight hundred just as he stands
BTS And after several such adventures he left the walls alone
BTS They were I may say apprenticed to education to art to the church to science to literature
BTS Then the sharp cry of a squaw inside sent him scampering back to Kiche
BTS I saw the smoke issuing from his lips as he slowly turned his head and glanced out over the water in my direction
BTS What can be done with it
BTS But even this he was not allowed to complete
BTS We were in a labyrinth of ruin and our progress was slow
BTS He can only wrong himself
BTS Ernest laughed outright
BTS By the way what do you do for a living
BTS In truth many of our comrades toiled at making beautiful those same palaces and wonder-cities
BTS She is in a class by herself and not amenable to the ordinary standards of the revolutionists
BTS Their faces were set hard
BTS But it was not food that Buck and the huskies needed but rest
BTS Come on over with us socialists and play on the winning side
BTS That part of capital's unconsumed share bought back the bonds
BTS We could all live comfortably aboard
BTS Also another patrol machine had halted
BTS I told them we wanted live men not carcasses
BTS I looked toward the cutter
BTS Only two blocks he said
BTS He walked slowly and cautiously prepared to be assailed at any moment
BTS They have dreams I interrupted radiant flashing dreams  Of grub he concluded sententiously
BTS If the cheated Grangers became violent all was lost
BTS May God damn your soul to hell Wolf Larsen only hell's too good for you you coward you murderer you pig
BTS There must have been a touch of the melodramatic in my pose and voice for Maud smiled
BTS It was her first time on deck since she had come aboard
BTS At last one morning the propeller was quiet and the Narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement
BTS He still held the wheel and I felt that he was timing Time reckoning the passage of the minutes with each forward lunge and leeward roll of the Ghost
BTS One bully long res'
BTS The wear and tear of spring storms and melting snows had underwashed the bank and in one place had made a small cave out of a narrow fissure
BTS It is true that labor has from the beginning of history been in the dirt
BTS The Rockefellers went into gas and electricity when those industries had developed to the safe investment stage
BTS It was a quarter of a mile away when a thick squall of rain veiled it from view
BTS For his task he elected a vengeance on the shark
BTS It was in this way that the grey cub learned other attributes of his mother than the soft soothing tongue
BTS She swayed toward me and I caught her in my arms
BTS She was found insane
BTS There were the marks he had left when descending the crumbling wall of the hole
BTS I involuntarily shunned the thought of it and yet the thought continually arose in my mind like a haunting spectre
BTS As I was saying he went on as though nothing unwonted had happened the shark was not in the reckoning
BTS The team of ten dogs was unhitched and Buck with his own harness was put into the sled
BTS On a large transparent sheet compass and square in hand he was copying what appeared to be a scale of some sort or other
BTS And out of all the rack and ruin rose the form of the nascent Oligarchy imperturbable indifferent and sure
BTS And that night I slept on board and on deck beside my work
BTS He learned quickly
BTS The Second Revolt was truly international
BTS The Oligarchy was about to strike
BTS A great fear came upon him
BTS Ask any lawyer
BTS Thornton had been hurried into the wager heavy with doubt
BTS There was no longer anything to detain us on Endeavour Island
BTS He was wise
BTS I'm willin' to bet that more accidents happens in the hour before whistle-blow than in all the rest of the day
BTS He symbolised it was its personification so that when they showed their teeth to him they were defending themselves against the powers of destruction that lurked in the shadows of the forest and in the dark beyond the camp-fire
BTS Don't I know
BTS ' And as he spoke he extended from his splendid shoulders his two great arms and the horseshoer's hands were clutching the air like eagle's talons
BTS but Wolf Larsen's fist drove midway between on the chest with a crushing resounding impact
BTS His incessant talking and shouting and bellowing of orders had been too much for Wolf Larsen who had accordingly foisted the nuisance upon his hunters
BTS And so it came that White Fang learned that the right to punish was something the gods reserved for themselves and denied to the lesser creatures under them
BTS Across Marsh Tagish and Bennett seventy miles of lakes they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to run towed behind the sled at the end of a rope
BTS In twelve years their numbers have been doubled
BTS Like had been replaced by love
BTS She was lying on the pavement in a pool of blood
BTS I beg your pardon I said or shouted rather in order to make myself heard above the roar of the rookery
BTS Nex' time you can go to 'ell say I an' I've a good mind to give you what-for anyw'y
BTS Also Dr
BTS I cried
BTS He got hold toward the base where the neck comes out from the shoulders
BTS His dream was merging into something else he knew not what
BTS He would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss or into the black soil where long grasses grew and snort with joy at the fat earth smells
BTS They were eyes that masked the soul with a thousand guises and that sometimes opened at rare moments and allowed it to rush up as though it were about to fare forth nakedly into the world on some wonderful adventure eyes that could brood with the hopeless sombreness of leaden skies
BTS He stood on his own legs
BTS In which case it would find itself face to face with the dog attacked and also it would find itself facing the whip of the driver
BTS A pair of workman's brogans encased my feet and for trousers I was furnished with a pair of pale blue washed-out overalls one leg of which was fully ten inches shorter than the other
BTS and here it was being infringed upon
BTS but the spirit of something I had seen before was strong upon me impelling me to give service to Wolf Larsen as Wolf Larsen had once given service to another man
BTS We knew not what to expect of him next what fearful thing rising above the flesh he might break out and do
BTS father began then paused
BTS The growl rose in the throat with the culmination of each forward-pushing movement and ebbed down to start up afresh with the beginning of the next movement
BTS That is unconstitutional
BTS On her other side ran a gaunt old wolf grizzled and marked with the scars of many battles
BTS Every night regularly at nine at twelve at three they lifted a nocturnal song a weird and eerie chant in which it was Buck's delight to join
BTS It was the face I am convinced of a man who did no wrong
BTS Johansen he thrashed on the amidships deck the other night since which time the mate has called him by his proper name
BTS They still trouble me was his answer
BTS A moment later he emerged a heavy-set young fellow of eighteen or nineteen with a glowering villainous countenance trailing at his heels
BTS All you need is one star in the sky on a dirty night to know instantly where you are
BTS And if anything should happen to you think of me left here alone
BTS But when Buck finished his ration and returned he found his nest occupied
BTS Buck can start a thousand pounds
BTS I don't know how to turn the trick
BTS You are an old man
BTS He was a large man poorly dressed and on his back was a great load of rattan and bamboo stands chairs and screens
BTS He bristled and showed his teeth his eyes vigilant his whole body wary and prepared for anything
BTS It was all muscle bone and sinew-fighting flesh in the finest condition
BTS or was I a revolutionist who had somewhere somehow dreamed that in some former existence I have lived in Berkeley and never known of life more violent than teas and dances debating societies and lectures rooms
BTS His jaws let go their grip and he leaped backward to escape this strange danger his lips drawn back from his fangs his throat snarling every hair bristling with rage and fright
BTS White Fang sat down in the shadow of a birch and whimpered softly
BTS They were soft and helpless made much noise and floundered around clumsily trying to accomplish by main strength what he accomplished by dexterity and cunning
BTS I had steeled myself to brazen it out though I was trembling inwardly
BTS Calvin who had once been a great dairy-owner
BTS Wolf Larsen was unaffected by the drink yet he drank glass for glass and if anything his glasses were fuller
BTS A comrade I said
BTS I might have known it I said impatiently
BTS But no thing of fear pounced out and when he had gained the inside he scouted carefully around looking at it and finding it not
BTS for goodness' sake Maud demanded
BTS They will be compelled to work just as the farmers are compelled to work now for the masters who robbed them of their land
BTS There were the eaters and the eaten
BTS In the terrible wolf-struggle of those centuries no man was permanently safe no matter how much wealth he amassed
BTS I'm going to give that brother of mine a taste of his own medicine
BTS Why can we not return to ways of our fathers when this republic was founded
BTS From the beginning there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin
BTS Judgin' by your actions one'd think you didn't know your own mind
BTS Jackson had been working many hours and his muscles had lost their resiliency and snap
BTS I had to rest frequently
BTS It was the curiosity of growth that urged him on the necessity of learning and living and doing that brings experience
BTS McCready and Swanson sir the boy corrected his eyes burning with a bitter light
BTS PART IV CHAPTER I THE ENEMY OF HIS KIND Had there been in White Fang's nature any possibility no matter how remote of his ever coming to fraternise with his kind such possibility was irretrievably destroyed when he was made leader of the sled-team
BTS while my most conservative calculation placed on its beaches two hundred thousand seals
BTS I waited watching two men who stood by the wheel one of them steering
BTS He was worth nothing to the world
BTS Biedenbach was in despair--we heard all about it afterward--and he went up alone in the third balloon
BTS Despite the pain and helplessness Spitz struggled madly to keep up
BTS Or does some one else feed you
BTS The cabin still rang with his voice as he stood there swaying his bronzed face shining his head up and dominant and his eyes golden and masculine intensely masculine and insistently soft flashing upon Maud at the door
BTS Again Wolf Larsen laughed at the same time beckoning them with his arm to follow
BTS It was necessary that they should be thrown off the track and that I should win to California
BTS Callous as they were to my suffering they were equally callous to their own when anything befell them
BTS It was inexplicable
BTS The next morning I dug a shallow ditch around the tent and an hour later a sudden gust of wind whipping over the rocky wall behind us picked up the tent and smashed it down on the sand thirty yards away
BTS He's no slouch at dog-breakin' that's wot I say one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically
BTS The hunters had packed their belongings with similar haste
BTS Several more days were consumed in finishing the sails and putting them on
BTS He turned them over and looked at their faces
BTS I now caught my first fair glimpse of the woman
BTS What do I mean
BTS Week by week more of the socialist papers were barred from the mails and in a number of instances the Black Hundreds destroyed the socialist presses
BTS Under some pretext after the girls had landed at Petaluma Creek and taken to the horses he managed to get away from the boat
BTS What can we say now
BTS It's the only contraption that'll ever hold One Ear he said
BTS But this could not last for ever
BTS Then he woke up
BTS He looked apprehensively about him as though dreading discovery and made an attempt to walk on
BTS Nevertheless the work of the country went on
BTS To my amused chagrin he discovered my shoes on the forecastle head and brought them back with him into the galley
BTS Scott's eyes were shining
BTS He seemed to have grown limp
BTS That's all right Standish was the reply
BTS The lanyards had been almost severed with just enough left to hold the shrouds till some severe strain should be put upon them
BTS Maud Brewster quavered
BTS Never mind what's up he answered gruffly
BTS Ernest always overworked
BTS Disabled in that typhoon
BTS He slowly moved his head back and forth under it and turned from side to side now in the sunshine now in the shade feeling the shadow as it were testing it by sensation
BTS Suddenly he found himself at the mouth of the cave
BTS I thought of Maud asleep there in the hut we had reared
BTS it is the head of the Rockefeller chain of banks which includes fourteen banks and trust companies in New York City and banks of great strength and influence in every large money center in the country
BTS In the meantime the astonished team-dogs had burst out of their nests only to be set upon by the fierce invaders
BTS His cunning was wolf cunning and wild cunning
BTS but what tangible good have they wrought for mankind
BTS And very quietly he smelled the air and read the message it bore of a strange god's presence
BTS White Fang resisted and he could feel the jaws shifting their grip slightly relaxing and coming together again in a chewing movement
BTS He was to select the moment for the throwing of the bomb and he naively confesses that in his interest in Everhard's tirade and the general commotion raised thereby he nearly forgot his mission
BTS When driven with his mates to the new owners' camp Buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair tent half stretched dishes unwashed everything in disorder
BTS I often remembered figures from that other life and curiously enough they appeared and disappeared now and again in my new life
BTS They were unable to move the sled
BTS Holding his club prepared to strike he drew in on his cornered quarry
BTS No I am not
BTS This other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm with muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and swelling
BTS It was in the air and its presence was made visible by the armed soldiers drawn up in lines in the corridors and by the officers grouped in the entrances to the House itself
BTS Once after ten years had passed Ernest made a calculation from figures furnished by the chiefs of the Fighting Groups and his conclusion was that the average life of a man or woman after becoming a member was five years
BTS It will work I know it will work I cried
BTS Later on when each developed individuality and became personally conscious of impulsions and desires the attraction of the light increased
BTS Also and with equal suddenness the book disappeared from the market
BTS And it was a long long night weary and dreary and long
BTS You Mr
BTS At least they had put an end to the discussion
BTS He must have leaped also at the same instant straight down on Wolf Larsen
BTS His tiny rages were much more terrible than theirs
BTS He saw once for all that he stood no chance against a man with a club
BTS The lucky eat the most and move the longest that is all
BTS He smiled inscrutably but did not answer
BTS This jaw gave the impression of ferocious determination
BTS His body bunched together as though for a spring and his face became as an infuriated beast's as he snarled It's a  A what
BTS Her low hull lifted and rolled to windward on a sea
BTS His contention was that it was finer for a finite mortal speck of life to feel Godlike than for a god to feel godlike
BTS He heard the shrill voices of the women the gruff basses of the men and the snarling of the dogs
BTS We shall be robbed of our few remaining liberties
BTS He was still whimpering when the mother-weasel reappeared
BTS The impression to be made on the minds of the Chicago comrades was that the general Revolt was beginning albeit with a confusing miscarriage in many details
BTS Pike made painful efforts
BTS The other suspicion was allayed
BTS It had been my intention to have her meals served apart but Wolf Larsen put down his foot
BTS Consider yourself on salary during the time you remain with us
BTS What now
BTS Come on
BTS Mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice
BTS and in the same instant he seemed to see a vision of those same sensitive and delicate fingers being crushed and torn by the white teeth of the she-wolf
BTS That roof must go on I answered grimly
BTS Her sense of humour was really the artist's instinct for proportion
BTS Faint and dizzy I was vaguely aware of a strong arm around my body under the arms and half-lifting me and dragging me along
BTS 'Look here Professor' he said 'this is too much
BTS But Hartman only cursed the Iron Heel and we passed on
BTS It's the bloody mate
BTS They were new dogs utterly transformed by the harness
BTS He was even gorged from his latest kill
BTS so he might as well start in right now
BTS You know nothing was his rude reply
BTS And all the while rolling plunging climbing the moving mountains and falling and wallowing in the foaming valleys the schooner Ghost was fighting her way farther and farther into the heart of the Pacific and I was on her
BTS I was wrong
BTS An almost funereal gloom seemed to have descended upon the Ghost
BTS I nodded my head
BTS His captain could have killed him and I doubt not that blood would have flowed had not Maud Brewster been present
BTS Thornton knelt down by Buck's side
BTS His victory over Death Larsen seemed to have had a remarkable effect upon him
BTS Wolf Larsen had been quite right
BTS Mebbe he won't do for us but mark my words hell 'll be an ice-box to this ship from now on
BTS The look in his eyes as he felt the keen edge and glared at me was positively carnivorous
BTS Three hours more were required to gasket the mainsail and jib and at two in the morning nearly dead the life almost buffeted and worked out of me I had barely sufficient consciousness to know the experiment was a success
BTS I was swept on by those behind and could not look down and see and yet I knew that it was a woman who had fallen and who was being trampled into the pavement by thousands of successive feet
BTS White Fang walked stiff-legged up the steps and across the porch with tail rigidly erect keeping his eyes on Dick to guard against a flank attack and at the same time prepared for whatever fierce manifestation of the unknown that might pounce out upon him from the interior of the house
BTS She pressed my hand earnestly and let me go
BTS I could see the head-lines in the papers
BTS It is a picture and I can see it now the jagged edges of the hole in the side of the cabin through which the grey fog swirled and eddied
BTS Also there was a lust in him akin to madness which had come with sight of the blood he had drawn
BTS He regarded her smilingly
BTS There is no discussion
BTS ' 'Bother that
BTS Can she get rid of this surplus to the United States
BTS He came of a breed of meat-killers and meat-eaters
BTS All his days White Fang had foraged among the live things for food
BTS she murmured you startled me and you are cruel
BTS Ardis was completed in 1942 A
BTS The surgeon smiled indulgently
BTS Of all the terrible things I have witnessed never have I been so unnerved as by this frantic creature's pleading for life
BTS Buck retreated two or three steps
BTS But to return
BTS A third of God's angels he had led with him and straightway he incited man to rebel against God and gained for himself and hell the major portion of all the generations of man
BTS And henceforth that shall be my name for him
BTS His head was all right again he said and so without further parley I left him
BTS Down at the very first he had been unable to gain his feet and for all of his tremendous strength I felt that there was no hope for him
BTS In this manner it came about that he fought all sizes and breeds of dogs
BTS Reversion
BTS also she turned a deaf ear to my entreaties when I begged her to desist
BTS Now what do you say
BTS Late in the afternoon I sighted a steamer's smoke on the horizon to leeward and I knew it either for a Russian cruiser or more likely the Macedonia still seeking the Ghost
BTS Nothing had happened
BTS How hard he toiled and how greatly he suffered I well know
BTS And so it was that she had commanded
BTS I was aware of the demand for action and my old helplessness strong upon me I was waiting for him to take the initiative
BTS The scorching torrent was enough to wither the face of the corpse
BTS Again I hurried on
BTS The food you eat is a bloody stew
BTS The hound under the command Dick
BTS You are metaphysicians
BTS but this time the price offered was in bottles not dollars and Grey Beaver's ears were more eager to hear
BTS He's coming to see how we take it
BTS There was only one galley knife that as a knife amounted to anything
BTS And there was reason for it
BTS Trouble was always afoot and at the bottom of it was Buck
BTS for I assure you I am not in the least angry
BTS The weasel never relaxed her hold
BTS I must not lose one crawl or squirm if I am to get the most out of the ferment
BTS Hammerfield's judgment of Ernest which was to the effect that he was an insolent young puppy made bumptious by a little and very inadequate learning
BTS I can think more clearly than ever in my life before
BTS You've got spunk as you Yanks s'y an' I like yer in a w'y
BTS He began to accompany his mother on the meat-trail and he saw much of the killing of meat and began to play his part in it
BTS On one such night while all the house slept White Fang awoke and lay very quietly
BTS As he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly with caution in every movement till he came to an open place among the trees and looking out saw erect on haunches with nose pointed to the sky a long lean timber wolf
BTS It is true one cannot eat much when there is no work
BTS Cringing and snivelling himself before the blows or angry speech of a man he revenged himself in turn upon creatures weaker than he
BTS Yet the seal-oil burned brightly and we were warm and comfortable
BTS In reality this was an alliance between the Emperor and the Oligarchy for the purpose of meeting their common foe the revolutionary proletariat of both countries
BTS Later the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the forest
BTS And here may well end the story of Buck
BTS Buck held on till he was on a line straight above Thornton
BTS he called to me
BTS Sometimes however he dropped cautiously and slowly behind and edged in between the old leader and the she-wolf
BTS Let us gather tundra grass and thatch the roof Maud said
BTS CHAPTER XIII For three days I did my own work and Thomas Mugridge's too
BTS I shook my head
BTS Van Weyden's neck
BTS I wondered what this man could have got from such a work
BTS What will happen when every country in the world down to the smallest and last with a surplus in its hands stands confronting every other country with surpluses in their hands
BTS The ex-governor of Idaho had been mysteriously murdered
BTS One Eye watched
BTS What's the Constitution got to do with it
BTS I had always heard that the strength of men was an irresistible attraction to women
BTS And I'm going to confound you with them right now
BTS We merely explain it as Newton explained gravitation
BTS I listened for a while to the behaviour of the Ghost to the pounding of the seas and the muffled roar of the wind on deck and then turned over on my side and slept peacefully until morning
BTS You'll be without that knife when I come for you
BTS He received it as a sign
BTS Wolf Larsen rove a bowline in a piece of rope and slipped it under his shoulders
BTS When he strong man that he was loving life as he did accepted his death it was plain that he was troubled by something more than mere blindness
BTS Our paddle-wheels stopped their pulsing beat died away and then they started again
BTS He died in Cabanas in Cuba where three of his comrades were also confined
BTS It is not right she concluded
BTS He was hungry and he remembered pieces of meat and fish that had been thrown him
BTS But by the very process of unloading the surpluses the resources of those countries are in turn developed
BTS Thus it was that in the fall of 1912 the socialist leaders with the exception of Ernest decided that the end of capitalism had come
BTS Then he sallied forth
BTS Understand
BTS At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out fires were built and breakfast was eaten
BTS He turned his head and blinked at the men who shouted at the same time wagging his stump of a tail good-naturedly
BTS came the hail from on deck and his face brightened
BTS My skin was scorching in the torment of fire
BTS Because he trusted his life to solid bread and butter and roast beef
BTS Consciousness was blotted out by the darkness he had so graphically described and when I came to myself I was lying on the floor and he was smoking a cigar and regarding me thoughtfully with that old familiar light of curiosity in his eyes
BTS The master was still in the cabin
BTS The gang-plank was hauled in and the Aurora swung out from the bank
BTS In addition to the labor troubles and the discontent of the farmers and of the remnant of the middle class a religious revival had blazed up
BTS He's got intelligence and we've got to give that intelligence a chance
BTS And still we rocked gently and there was no wind
BTS There are two or three standing quarrels in the forecastle
BTS And don't forget that it is the press the pulpit and the university that mould public opinion set the thought-pace of the nation
BTS his lips writhed back and his little fangs were bared
BTS But that danger-point was never reached
BTS He rolled toward it grovelled toward it fell toward it when he was knocked down
BTS The hunters are looking for a shooting scrape at any moment between Smoke and Henderson whose old quarrel has not healed while Wolf Larsen says positively that he will kill the survivor of the affair if such affair comes off
BTS Scott cried suddenly
BTS When I returned from throwing them overside he was talking to Harrison whose honest yokel's face was filled with fascination and wonder
BTS Remember also that your law is the stuff of a day and that you are not versatile in the stuff of more than a day
BTS Mebbe you'll need that in your business Henry said
BTS Now tell me you two do you find me good
BTS and beneath my smile was the seriousness of the anxiety of love
BTS No I repeat metaphysics had nothing to do with it
BTS Your words are empty to me
BTS the chemistry of the life that composed them demanded the light as a necessity of being
BTS How'll he know which was which
BTS Again he chuckled
BTS But now that it had come I could not believe
BTS ' Maud looked at me surprised and shocked
BTS This helped the cub's courage and though the woodpecker he next encountered gave him a start he proceeded confidently on his way
BTS They were stars I knew and flaring comets that peopled my flight among the suns
BTS Of the passage from the galley to the cabin I knew nothing
BTS The wolves were gone
BTS Hammerfield suddenly demanded What is the test of truth young man
BTS What does your boasted immortality amount to when your life runs foul of mine
BTS When I emerged on deck it seemed that the end of everything had come
BTS He nodded then added Or he wouldn't be keepin' up such a clip
BTS His test of truth is 'Will it work
BTS Buck was inexorable
BTS He was dominated by this mere flesh-love of life
BTS A little later the question came to me in another way What would the Master do
BTS It was not until January 1917 that we left the refuge
BTS The Iron Heel is getting bold
BTS It goes on everywhere
BTS and where judgment was required and quick thinking and quick acting he showed himself the superior even of Spitz of whom Francois had never seen an equal
BTS All day they swung up and down the main street in long teams and in the night their jingling bells still went by
BTS Cooky's sharpening his knife for Hump was being whispered about among the sailors and some of them twitted him about it
BTS Knowing his deadly method of fighting the master had never ceased impressing upon White Fang the law that he must not fight
BTS Revenge was the ruling motive and the members of the terroristic organizations were careless of their own lives and hopeless about the future
BTS and when the oligarchs have passed away their great roads and their wonder cities will remain for the brotherhood of labor to tread upon and dwell within
BTS Savageness was a part of his make-up but the savageness thus developed exceeded his make-up
BTS The nausea overpowered me and I managed to crawl to the side of the vessel
BTS but I succeeded before nightfall in getting it all spread out on the beach to dry
BTS Where now was our project of remasting the Ghost
BTS It was with nervous trepidation that we made the first few rods of the journey
BTS A snarl and a flash of fangs and that dog would wail his indignation to the uncomforting stars while White Fang finished his portion for him
BTS His school of life had been sterner and he was himself of sterner stuff
BTS Understand
BTS In face of the facts that modern man lives more wretchedly than the cave-man and that his producing power is a thousand times greater than that of the cave-man no other conclusion is possible than that the capitalist class has mismanaged that you have mismanaged my masters that you have criminally and selfishly mismanaged
BTS an inch
BTS Of cheap things it is the cheapest
BTS What do you mean
BTS but once around the second and we went perilously near we picked up the third headland still in line with the wind and with the other two
BTS The ignorance evidenced by the business men at the dinner was nothing unusual
BTS Once aboard the two prisoners hoisted in the boat and under Wolf Larsen's direction carried the wounded boat-steerer down into the forecastle
BTS Go and see Colonel Ingram
BTS but with what was I to cover them
BTS If it has never been discovered all these years it may never be discovered
BTS while Billee the good-natured with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons cried and whimpered throughout the night
BTS When morning came and a dim light pervaded the lair he again sought after the source of the remotely familiar sounds
BTS Occasionally the wires were up and he spoke as well as ever though slowly and heavily
BTS I have never seen body and spirit in such perfect accord
BTS and here were many Indians much food and unprecedented excitement
BTS As usual I had underrated the amount of work involved in this portion of the task and two long days were necessary to complete it
BTS To his mind this was power unusual power inconceivable and beyond the natural power that was godlike
BTS Fish in open pools were not too quick for him
BTS He turned and walked aft to the wheel
BTS They were given short shrift
BTS And there will be no tea no soups nothing hot till we have made land somewhere somehow
BTS The same conditions obtained in the nineteenth century A
BTS In fact though this strength pervaded every action of his it seemed but the advertisement of a greater strength that lurked within that lay dormant and no more than stirred from time to time but which might arouse at any moment terrible and compelling like the rage of a lion or the wrath of a storm
BTS Its share of the wealth of the country consists of clothes and household furniture with here and there in very rare cases an unencumbered home
BTS Fair weather was over and there was nothing left but to return to the galley
BTS But if the white gods were all-powerful their dogs did not amount to much
BTS Economic clashes were usually succeeded by wars and this particular clash was no exception
BTS Now you must promise you won't be harsh with them for the rest of the trip or I won't go a step
BTS When I dismantled my old Pantheon and cast out Napoleon and Caesar and their fellows I straightway erected a new Pantheon she answered gravely and the first I installed was Dr
BTS The wonderful patience of the trail which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore and remain sweet of speech and kindly did not come to these two men and the woman
BTS Henry stopped eating to glance across the fire and count the dogs
BTS Never in my life had food been so welcome
BTS It is an attack upon all churches upon the pomp and splendor of all churches that have wandered from the Master's path and hedged themselves in from his lambs
BTS And look at him
BTS The sun had dimmed and faded out of sight
BTS These headaches of his these attacks Maud said on the afternoon of the fourth day
BTS I had never met a man like him
BTS Then he took the trail the lightened sled bounding along behind the willing dogs
BTS and the next moment cap in hand he was saying I beg your pardon
BTS White Fang resisted it
BTS They sound a note of warning
BTS Mr
BTS well a dream
BTS In the bow was Kerfoot Oofty-Oofty in the stern and Kelly amidships
BTS And it is so good that money
BTS Then it was counter-massacre
BTS I sometimes thought that he hated even himself so grotesquely had life dealt with him and so monstrously
BTS I rolled my head negatively on the floor
BTS Dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled where the going was easy but continued to flounder alongside in the soft snow where the going was most difficult till exhausted
BTS This occurred in 2002 A
BTS She's the decoy for the pack
BTS She found him guilty before the act and treated him accordingly
BTS Then when the storm broke Wolf Larsen cruised back and forth over that portion of the ocean where we had encountered it and somewhat more to the westward while the boats were being repaired and new sails made and bent
BTS It cannot help itself
BTS Look at the fish and their millions of eggs
BTS A surgeon came in to dress the wounded soldier and I learned that it was two in the afternoon
BTS Insolent
BTS Curly and he were taken below by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called Francois
BTS So changed was he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him
BTS Then came a momentary fear when he yelped several times to the impact of the hand
BTS These Fighting groups were modelled somewhat after the Fighting Organization of the Russian Revolution and despite the unceasing efforts of the Iron Heel these groups persisted throughout the three centuries of its existence
BTS That night a German fleet made a dash on Honolulu sinking three American cruisers and a revenue cutter and bombarding the city
BTS The trail was in excellent condition well packed and hard and there was no new-fallen snow with which to contend
BTS They sold nothing
BTS I noted them walking the deck together one morning and I likened them to the extreme ends of the human ladder of evolution the one the culmination of all savagery the other the finished product of the finest civilization
BTS Why don't you come down and kill me you murderer
BTS The national government took possession of the state government and all was over for California
BTS Understand
BTS He had a vague feeling of impending doom
BTS Instead of habeas corpus you would get post mortems
BTS Wall Street--so named from a street in ancient New York where was situated the stock exchange and where the irrational organization of society permitted underhanded manipulation of all the industries of the country
BTS He stood gazing stupidly across at White Fang the raw red shin-bone between them
BTS It is the race heritage the sadness which has made the race sober-minded clean-lived and fanatically moral and which in this latter connection has culminated among the English in the Reformed Church and Mrs
BTS Then she ate the dogs
BTS Then he sat down pointed his nose upward and howled
BTS see
BTS I might be able to help you a  her voice broke a little
BTS The book was published in 1905 of the Christian Era
BTS I did not see the expedite fall when he cut it loose
BTS In that moment I could have put my arms around her and drawn her to me
BTS The sea had turned a dull leaden grey and grown rougher and was now tossing foaming whitecaps to the sky
BTS The blankets were soaking
BTS Wolf Larsen shook his head
BTS One Ear drew near to her still alert and cautious his tail and ears in the air his head held high
BTS His was the perfect poise the supreme confidence in self which nothing could shake
BTS Or as chance might have it he would lie farther away to the side or rear watching the outlines of the man and the occasional movements of his body
BTS It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap
BTS The dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as Spitz disappeared from view
BTS The sail emptied and the gaff swung amid-ships
BTS CHAPTER II CHALLENGES
BTS And I remembered what he had told me that no indictment of their morality could shake them
BTS All the young dogs followed Lip-lip's lead
BTS at first
BTS After a time Matt returned
BTS The bull-dog had managed to roll him over on his back and still hanging on to his throat was on top of him
BTS The cell was of iron the floor the walls the roof
BTS Buck wanted it
BTS In their very great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the bruise of the club
BTS I saw the back of the man at the wheel and the head of the other man turning slowly turning as his gaze struck the water and casually lifted along it toward me
BTS Drumhead court martial was their portion and military execution their end
BTS When he appeared amongst them there was always a squabble
BTS ' he snorted
BTS He had eaten the lynx kitten
BTS Not a line not a thought that he uttered
BTS But the dog younger or smaller than himself was weak a thing to be destroyed
BTS It was no more than a stiff blow but to us fighting for life in our frail craft it was indeed a storm
BTS But we socialists knew about it
BTS But he was trapped amid the palms and rubber trees
BTS It certainly should and furthermore it does
BTS But the three days' rest was good in spite of it all for it had given my knee the very chance it needed
BTS I have neither aptitude nor inclination for fiction
BTS Who's to pull or steer or sail ship if he loses yer
BTS That would have been terrible
BTS I could feel other hands at my throat
BTS Wherever a man was encountered he was shot down on the spot
BTS But Wolf Larsen seemed voluble prone to speech as I had never seen him before
BTS Again we climbed a ridge this time riding under red-limbed madronos and manzanitas of deeper red
BTS He smiled indulgently
BTS And through the air he is rushing on to his Gethsemane
BTS That is the women shrank and fear was in their faces
BTS But you I interjected
BTS I'm just reading Browning he confessed and it's pretty tough
BTS Coming aboard as I passed through the cabin I had noticed with greedy eyes a stout gentleman reading the Atlantic which was open at my very essay
BTS Oh 'ow I 'ate 'im
BTS You cannot pick it up in your two hands and look at it
BTS Life proved not to be fine and gracious
BTS The metaphysician reasons deductively out of his own subjectivity
BTS And it was disembodied
BTS In the same fashion especially in the heat of summer when he suffered from the sun he experienced faint longings for the Northland
BTS There was a flash of yellow before his eyes
BTS And in the enforced solitude of the sanitarium he recovered
BTS Of course there's lots that's repugnant in the course of the day's work
BTS Who made those beds
BTS Couldn't 've seen 'm for smoke
BTS I like you a hundred per cent
BTS The world of books and bookish folk is very vague more like a dream memory than an actuality
BTS Who Has Won to Mastership Eh
BTS I made no haste to return on deck and when I did I was gratified to see Miss Brewster in animated conversation with Wolf Larsen
BTS But this was quickly followed by anger
BTS Through daylight and dark I follow the bark I keep like a hound on her trail
BTS Though Ernest lay in prison three thousand miles away on the Pacific Coast I was in unbroken communication with him and our letters passed regularly back and forth
BTS And women there are who become sad when the word goes over the fire of how the Evil Spirit came to select that valley for an abiding-place
BTS and morning noon and night and all night as well he devoted himself to making life unlivable for them
BTS was his next question
BTS He merely classified the things that hurt and the things that did not hurt
BTS As I started toward the weather side I saw him make a sudden motion with his head which I mistook for a token of recognition and good-morning
BTS He whistled to himself softly first with surprise and then at the end with admiration
BTS It was broken by Wolf Larsen
BTS They even slept
BTS You are machine-breakers
BTS It was an expression of perfect confidence of absolute self-surrender as though he said I put myself into thy hands
BTS And so we talked while the killing of the wounded went on
BTS Wolf Larsen dropped my hand with a flirt of disdain
BTS Straight away he raced with Dolly panting and frothing one leap behind
BTS I was only five feet away and directly in what should have been his line of vision
BTS As Buck watched them Thornton knelt beside him and with rough kindly hands searched for broken bones
BTS This meant a soft trail greater friction on the runners and heavier pulling for the dogs
BTS As for the artists they merely pander to the little less than ignoble tastes of the Plutocracy
BTS And now a strange thing happened to me
BTS It was the maker of the track a large female lynx
BTS 'Tis nothin' I've said
BTS In the mere detail of voice intonation I practised almost perpetually till the voice of my new self became fixed automatic
BTS Be quite friendly with him talk with him discuss literature and art with him he is fond of such things
BTS Then Francois's lash descended and Buck had the satisfaction of watching Spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the teams
BTS and in the moment of asking I was aware of a solicitude that was something more than slight
BTS An' how is it ye can get men to do anything on God's earth an' sea
BTS Wickson exercised tremendous social power in the university town and from them emanated the sentiment that I was a too-forward and self-assertive young woman with a mischievous penchant for officiousness and interference in other persons' affairs
BTS Power it shall be
BTS The life of his body and of every fibre of his body the life that was the very substance of his body and that was apart from his own personal life had yearned toward this light and urged his body toward it in the same way that the cunning chemistry of a plant urges it toward the sun
BTS Dat Spitz fight lak hell said Perrault as he surveyed the gaping rips and cuts
BTS The intent of the snarl is to warn or frighten and judgment is required to know when it should be used
BTS But Bill shook his head
BTS I cried
BTS Drop it
BTS The Newfoundland went first followed by the three short-haired pointers the two mongrels hanging more grittily on to life but going in the end
BTS Here are our hands
BTS He has humor I thought and I almost forgave him his clothes
BTS I want to ask a favour Mr
BTS And since you've had a night's start you shall teach me what you have learned
BTS Never did he fail to respond savagely to the chatter of the squirrel he had first met on the blasted pine
BTS and he did see me for he sprang to the wheel thrusting the other man aside and whirled it round and round hand over hand at the same time shouting orders of some sort
BTS You can prove everything and nothing and no two of you can agree upon anything
BTS And since then I've noticed that three little corner groceries have gone out of business
BTS Utility he interrupted
BTS The hunting promised to be profitable
BTS the other demanded aggressively
BTS He was thinner and there were lines on his face which I had never seen before
BTS I was too happy and the fatigue of jail-breaking and riding horseback had not been mine
BTS As one is afraid of a snake or a tiger or a shark
BTS The callousness of these men to whom industrial organization gave control of the lives of other men was appalling
BTS At the same time the Iron Heel helped Mexico and Cuba to put down revolt
BTS Almost equally swift but not quite was Wolf Larsen
BTS Every odd moment he could find he had the knife and stone out and was whetting away
BTS White Fang soon learned that very few of these gods not more than a dozen lived at this place
BTS He brought his papers out at a loss of a million and a half each month
BTS Watch me
BTS The mob of which we had been a part and which had been put in retreat was prevented from escaping to the south and east by strong bodies of troops
BTS I did return not long ago but unfortunately the skippers were dead all but one a mate in the old days a skipper when I met him and when I left him a cripple who would never walk again
BTS Mean what
BTS They might do as they pleased amongst themselves
BTS Then they became friendly and played about in the nervous half-coy way with which fierce beasts belie their fierceness
BTS Thornton saw him coming and as Buck struck him like a battering ram with the whole force of the current behind him he reached up and closed with both arms around the shaggy neck
BTS Not one word could he get out of them that would have helped Jackson
BTS I have made beds she replied
BTS But is he
BTS But Mr
BTS my flesh revolted
BTS She had not raised her voice and yet I was struck by its clear and bell-like tone
BTS Of course he answered
BTS What you want is to make profits yourself
BTS Men were weak
BTS They divide between them this money that is earned
BTS Get a knife somebody
BTS He winced but held on
BTS He painfully lifted himself on his elbow and turned loose with his automatic pistol
BTS Three hundred and a present at that was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater
BTS I obeyed and a minute or two later they stood before him
BTS He now evinced displeasure at her repeated failures and himself made a mighty spring upward
BTS He heard Grey Beaver chuckle above him and he knew the sound was not hostile
BTS There is much light that I alone of all persons living can throw upon his character and so noble a character cannot be blazoned forth too brightly
BTS I had learned nothing but theories of life and society that looked all very well on the printed page but now I had seen life itself
BTS It was drastic
BTS Wherefore the Capitol had been packed with troops in anticipation
BTS Need I
BTS He would not go up to them
BTS But in all that wild waste there was no refuge for Leach and Johnson save on the Ghost and they resolutely began the windward beat
BTS We have not the strength with which to fight this man
BTS Well don't be a miser with what you know Scott said sharply after waiting a suitable length of time
BTS It became his chief delight in life as it became White Fang's chief torment
BTS Thus will the surplus be constantly expended while labor does the work
BTS It expresses the garrulity of the sea and is a pleasant break in the monotony of the life
BTS In vain we searched for him after our organization had developed
BTS The bullets we had received had travelled nearly a mile but by now we had cut that distance in half
BTS It'll all come right in the end
BTS He linked the past with the present and the eternity behind him throbbed through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and seasons swayed
BTS And never did it flag in its pursuit of him
BTS Take my advice and accept the vacation
BTS she asked turning to him and looking him squarely in the eyes
BTS I could hear the wind above
BTS This was no time for explanations
BTS Never had labor received such an all-around beating
BTS In India revolt was in full swing
BTS The coinage of such phrases was considered strokes of genius
BTS On the night of the 22d of April they arose and murdered their officers only a small remnant of the latter escaping
BTS At first father laughed
BTS I was jealous
BTS --were the messages sent to us by our successful comrades in other lands
BTS Remains the proletariat
BTS Emotional delight is followed by no more than jaded senses which speedily recuperate
BTS He whined about the testimony
BTS I nodded my head
BTS Don't forget that they have already traded with one another and that these surpluses yet remain
BTS She looked penitent
BTS The great driving force of the oligarchs is the belief that they are doing right
BTS and I learned not long afterward that the berry was likewise a little weakness of Maud's
BTS he asked
BTS Why my dear sirs you are as remote from the intellectual life of the twentieth century as an Indian medicine-man making incantation in the primeval forest ten thousand years ago
BTS The lee rail where the dead man lay was buried in the sea and as the schooner lifted and righted the water swept across the deck wetting us above our shoe-tops
BTS Among them he said he had found keen intellects and brilliant wits ministers of the Gospel who had been broken because their Christianity was too wide for any congregation of mammon-worshippers and professors who had been broken on the wheel of university subservience to the ruling class
BTS Now that the terrible unknown had let go of him he forgot that the unknown had any terrors
BTS Her face was distorted and malignant with menace even the bridge of the nose wrinkling from tip to eyes so prodigious was her snarl
BTS You know law and business Colonel Van Gilbert
BTS There was my father
BTS It was in the summer that White Fang arrived at Fort Yukon
BTS He took the sea-lamp from its swinging frame and handed it to me
BTS He slowed down to an alert and mincing walk and then stopped
BTS Meat even meat itself he would forego to be with his god to receive a caress from him or to accompany him down into the town
BTS As Francois's whip backed him up Buck found it to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate
BTS They were simply so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly
BTS The hand poised like doom above him hesitated and the man spoke laughing Wabam wabisca ip pit tah
BTS Weedon Scott did not hear
BTS The camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking furry forms starving huskies four or five score of them who had scented the camp from some Indian village
BTS I know truth divine good from evil right from wrong
BTS By evening Perrault secured another dog an old husky long and lean and gaunt with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect
BTS It was there in the fibre of his being
BTS Far more potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before a seeming familiarity
BTS White Fang had observed closely the chicken-yards and the habits of the chickens
BTS They ain't a-goin' to get any more of our dogs if I can help it
BTS This was the end of the Appeal
BTS for the same reason I sail this schooner
BTS I was in fear that a struggle might take place but a cry from the helmsman made it easy for the situation to save itself
BTS There was no way of penetrating the island from our cove for the walls rose perpendicularly from the beach and on either side of the cove rose from the deep water
BTS Not only did all forward motion cease but we began to drift back and out to sea
BTS Well Leach are you going for'ard
BTS It was worth more in some strange way then a dozen pieces of meat from the hand of a squaw
BTS I was born to sufferin' and sorrer
BTS He refused to stir
BTS Mrs
BTS Then later becoming firmly grounded automatic the student reads writes and THINKS in French without any recourse to English at all
BTS There was imperative need to adjust myself to consider the significance of the changed aspect of things
BTS It is supposed that it was warmly seasoned
BTS As Buck grew winded Spitz took to rushing and he kept him staggering for footing
BTS He rushed as though attempting the old shoulder trick but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in
BTS If it didn't tangle so dreadfully she laughed
BTS Then there were the dogs puppies growing up like himself and grown dogs that did not look so large and formidable as the memory pictures he retained of them
BTS I've got the rheumatism in my hands
BTS Heads nodded in acquiescence
BTS But timid he was not
BTS We the people do not pay our judges sufficiently
BTS Also I have enjoyed working it out
BTS See 'm keep his eye on that club Matt said
BTS In the meantime he would wait and see
BTS And all the time we were being driven off into the north-east directly away from Japan and toward bleak Bering Sea
BTS Mush on
BTS They turned their shoulders to her most savage slashes and with wagging tails and mincing steps strove to placate her wrath
BTS There was the tenacity with which he clung to the earth
BTS I made it pretty awkward for him and he could only go on repeating himself and telling me how much he honored me and all the world honored me as a scientist
BTS Dear woman
BTS He gloated over his victim and his eyes flamed dully as he swung the whip or club and listened to White Fang's cries of pain and to his helpless bellows and snarls
BTS Also a bomb burst near me once in some still street where look as I would up and down I could see no human being
BTS But then life seems absurd to-day what of the machinations of the Plutocracy
BTS If our friends could see us now she said
BTS He dropped his burden in the corner by the stove and wiped his face on a coarse bandana handkerchief
BTS That and the troop-trains have made us late
BTS So that was the way they did it eh
BTS Still hundreds of miles from their goal nevertheless many of them had been on the way for a year and the least any of them had travelled to get that far was five thousand miles while some had come from the other side of the world
BTS God made you well I said
BTS But let me tell you this before you go
BTS She threw her head back in a queenly way but said Dear dear Endeavour Island
BTS Far from it
BTS Here he was born and here he had lived the four years of his life
BTS Likewise was denied them the right to move from place to place or the right to bear or possess arms
BTS He feigned at first and in doing so brought it on
BTS The task we set ourselves was threefold
BTS We are not going to die
BTS A puppy alone by the river bank meant a puppy dead or a puppy that aroused the camp with its shrill pain and terror as it fled back from the wolf-cub that had waylaid it
BTS An altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others
BTS To remedy this he ate as fast as they
BTS What form it will take I can't even guess
BTS For days and nights he bellowed his rage at the universe
BTS But the pack invariably lost him
BTS He was thinking rapidly
BTS The bottles were delivered but after two days
BTS He turned abruptly and irrelevantly upon Mr
BTS but Mr
BTS What good is it
BTS There were reports of numerous wireless stations that had been blown up with heavy rewards offered for the detection of the perpetrators
BTS He always was a fool dog said Bill
BTS her ferocity equalled his
BTS Though he lay down in the entrance and slept his sleep was fitful
BTS He was to know fear many times in his dealing with man
BTS There was not one who was not wounded in four or five places while some were wounded grievously
BTS Colonel Van Gilbert done Ernest arose and began to speak
BTS Though he suffered most of the damage and was always defeated his spirit remained unsubdued
BTS They know the direction by compass the distance and the speed
BTS I was learning more and more seamanship
BTS When she snarled her displeasure the old leader would whirl on the three-year-old
BTS During the period that he waited vainly for his mother to come back he led the pack many a wild chase through the adjacent woods
BTS His muzzle was the long wolf muzzle save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf
BTS He was fully clothed though his shirt was ripped open in front
BTS Never in all my life have I heard so many fallacies uttered in one short hour
BTS They knew more about the ways of the Southland gods than did he and in their eyes he had qualified when he accompanied the gods inside the house
BTS But there was one trial in White Fang's life Collie
BTS To disappear was in itself no easy thing
BTS bones were the only things breakable about them
BTS They have even resurrected the theory of the divine right of kings--commercial kings in their case
BTS I cocked both barrels and levelled the shot-gun at him
BTS Instinct and law demanded of him obedience
BTS So he followed morosely at Beauty Smith's heels his tail between his legs yet snarling softly under his breath
BTS and besides there was Wolf Larsen's star-scale so simple a device that a child could work it
BTS My whole right side is affected
BTS Three came the answer
BTS Why do you Mr
BTS I've never been sick in my life Hump he said as I guided him to his room
BTS It was congealed in death
BTS His driver lingered a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind
BTS but don't you think your measures were rather heroic
BTS She finished the concluding stanza without faltering and then slowly guided the conversation into less perilous channels
BTS Oh it won't be called that
BTS Jordan says that paths are left between the harems and that as long as the holluschickie keep strictly to the path they are unmolested by the masters of the harem
BTS A soft southland dog would have died under it but not he
BTS He measured the distance away to the fog-bank and for an instant paused to feel the weight of the wind on his cheek
BTS Johnson it seems bought a suit of oilskins from the slop-chest and found them to be of greatly inferior quality
BTS He was a sneak and a thief a mischief-maker a fomenter of trouble
BTS We worked feverishly at carrying our plunder on deck and depositing it amidships so feverishly that Maud whose strength was hardly a positive quantity had to give over exhausted and sit on the steps at the break of the poop
BTS Oh Humphrey she sobbed when will it all end
BTS It is due to his whim that I am still alive
BTS Then he would put it on the stone again and whet whet whet till I could have laughed aloud it was so very ludicrous
BTS This expression of abandon and surrender of absolute trust he reserved for the master alone
BTS He shook his head and with a deep sign as of awakening caught his breath
BTS Thus he was trying to shield himself from White Fang's teeth
BTS It would be so much nicer if he would be friendly with us and help us
BTS Wainwright the hunter whom Wolf Larsen had stolen with boat and men took advantage of the veiled sea and escaped
BTS First the weeding out from our circles of the secret agents of the Oligarchy
BTS He was a humanist and a lover
BTS But with nothing eternal before me but death given for a brief spell this yeasty crawling and squirming which is called life why it would be immoral for me to perform any act that was a sacrifice
BTS Two nights and a day he spent in the cabin
BTS Of course it would trade abroad certain things it produced for things it did not produce
BTS And why not
BTS There being no competition where there was a trust there was no need for the trusts to advertise
BTS He began with Mr
BTS A mound of dead and dying began to pile up over us and over this mound pawing and moaning crept those that still survived
BTS Buck's feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies
BTS He did not like the man
BTS They had many homes scattered over the country in the mountains on lakes and by the sea
BTS Then he led her to a small pine around which he tied the other string
BTS I could see that she was still badly frightened
BTS It came to me quite as a matter of course that this was Ernest and I found myself wondering how he had got his hair and eyebrows so badly singed
BTS The stream the lair and the quiet woods were calling to him and he wanted her to come
BTS He was pre-eminently unbeautiful
BTS I'll make them snarl like wolves
BTS Daylight came at nine o'clock
BTS God had stirred the nations to strife
BTS It will never rise again
BTS I remember the Forge
BTS It was only a shove a flirt of the wrist yet so tremendous was his strength that I was hurled backward as from a catapult
BTS The first Anarchist Maud laughed rising and preparing to withdraw to her state-room
BTS Chapter VII
BTS But as a rule he managed to maintain a dignity that was almost solemnity
BTS We could not escape
BTS It was my own phrase my pet secret phrase my love phrase for her
BTS At night when the sun went down the sheets were slackened
BTS Nothing happened
BTS These and the other bay cities practically composed one community
BTS I felt sad unutterably sad
BTS Your arguments are too er forcible I managed to articulate at cost of great pain to my aching throat
BTS Mugridge grinned insinuatingly in my face as I shoved him out and ordered him back to his galley work
BTS I smiled proudly at her too proudly for she dropped her eyes and was for the moment silent
BTS He never played and gambolled about with the other puppies of the camp
BTS It was pitiable
BTS At such times he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the tent where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master's breathing
BTS The day was filled with miserable variety
BTS The dog-musher wore a moustache but the other a taller and younger man was smooth-shaven his skin rosy from the pounding of his blood and the running in the frosty air
BTS They were gods
BTS Once he threw his heavy sheath-knife missing Wolf Larsen's throat by an inch
BTS I should not call it anything more than mathematical certainty
BTS Francois was stern demanding instant obedience and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience
BTS Wot's the good of mykin' a 'oly show of ourselves for them mugs
BTS You have asserted the impossible now let me demonstrate the inevitable
BTS He was right
BTS Wolf Larsen motioned Louis to keep off slightly and we dashed abreast of the boat not a score of feet to windward
BTS Once a month its members gathered at some one of their private houses to listen to a lecture
BTS Oaths and vile language of any sort had always been repellent to me
BTS But what I wanted to say was this You are in a perilous position--a peril that my own fear enhances because I am not able even to measure it
BTS And what good are they
BTS Gallantly they did
BTS A club might have stopped White Fang but not a whip
BTS He lay down and waited while the porcupine grated its teeth and uttered grunts and sobs and occasional sharp little squeals
BTS He knew the law even better than did the dogs that had known no other life and he observed the law more punctiliously
BTS Yes sir the cook eagerly interpolated with appeasing and apologetic servility
BTS He turned to Leach saying Such langwidge
BTS This had happened at the end of a second and less severe famine
BTS She was not running straight for us but ahead of us
BTS They come closer every night
BTS This institution took the place of the militia which had proved impracticable under the new regime
BTS Many young men of the Oligarchy impelled by sense of right conduct or their imaginations captured by the glory of the Revolution ethically or romantically devoted their lives to it
BTS When the oligarchs have completely mastered the people they will have time to spare for other things
BTS They wanted something to happen
BTS We held a housewarming in my hut the night it was roofed
BTS White Fang learned rapidly the ways of the camp
BTS Perrault knew dogs and when he looked at Buck he knew that he was one in a thousand One in ten t'ousand he commented mentally
BTS Nor was I prompted to lie through fear
BTS According to your ideas he too must be an immortal millionaire
BTS What was coming over the man
BTS Perhaps he is ill very ill
BTS He'll know as soon as ever he claps eyes on us Parsons replied
BTS This reference is to the socialist vote cast in the United States in 1910
BTS Something an incommunicable vastness of feeling rose up into his eyes as a light and shone forth
BTS And so far as your stupidity is concerned you are but the exemplar of your class
BTS And borne upon the necks of men I saw Like some great God the Holy Lord of Rome
BTS He never saw the sky nor the sunshine
BTS Before White Fang could spring in and deliver the fatal stroke and just as he was in the act of springing in Collie arrived
BTS His desire to kill strengthened with the days and he cherished hungry ambitions for the squirrel that chattered so volubly and always informed all wild creatures that the wolf-cub was approaching
BTS and on top of it he learned to avoid hurt first by not incurring the risk of it
BTS The tall young newcomer was forcing his way through shouldering men right and left without ceremony or gentleness
BTS It was pitiful
BTS into life insurance into banking
BTS The captain shrugged his shoulders
BTS Early one evening while it was yet twilight I had run across the street and into the butcher-shop to get some chops for Ernest's supper
BTS I came in violent collision with a large woman in front of me the man with the split coat had vanished while those behind collided against me
BTS Finally he commanded me to resume my seat at the cabin table for a time and let the cook do my work
BTS Lip-lip who had watched the whole proceeding from the bank now rushed upon him knocking him over and sinking his teeth into him
BTS He closed his hand upon it squeezed and the potato squirted out between his fingers in mushy streams
BTS Jackson I could not escape
BTS It was not that he had caught me in my solicitude but that I had caught myself and in his presence
BTS The spell of the cub's heritage was upon him the fear and the respect born of the centuries of struggle and the accumulated experience of the generations
BTS It was the expiring effort of organized labor
BTS As we had done before so again we sought shelter in an entrance
BTS She was in very good spirits however and made quite merry in accepting our plight as a grave one
BTS The next moment I was being introduced to him as Mary Holmes
BTS He did not want to bite the hand and he endured the peril of it until his instinct surged up in him mastering him with its insatiable yearning for life
BTS There will be no passing vessels except other sealing-schooners Wolf Larsen made answer
BTS I am all right now she said looking up at me gratefully
BTS There was nothing else for him to do
BTS the socialists were really justified in believing that the end of capitalism had come and in themselves throwing down the gauntlet to the Plutocracy
BTS The two animals threshed about the lynx ripping and tearing with her claws and using her teeth as well while the she-wolf used her teeth alone
BTS But White Fang did not follow them
BTS For the first few hours he was content with slinking around and watching them from a safe distance
BTS Harrison stood listlessly at the wheel half supporting himself by it as though wearied by the weight of his flesh
BTS In the meantime the erstwhile cabin-boy had not moved
BTS But this tacit conspiracy grew large
BTS But I shall be a different women for the experience as well as a stronger woman she answered
BTS Institutions and governments were everywhere crashing or transforming
BTS You have closed your ears to the voices that are crying in the land--the voices of pain and sorrow that you will not hear but that some day will be heard
BTS And outside he went like a king with all Sierra Vista about him and tending on him
BTS Her husband had an accident and was laid up in hospital three months
BTS This strength we cannot be stripped of
BTS And so it went the inexorable elimination of the superfluous
BTS He led a lost cause and he was not afraid of God's thunderbolts Wolf Larsen was saying
BTS He shook his head
BTS My feet were out from under me and I was turning over and over and being swept along I knew not where
BTS Asmunsen refused to serve
BTS They surrounded the cub and laughed at him while he wailed out his terror and his hurt
BTS but the strange dog no matter what the breed or valor swiftly acknowledged Buck's supremacy or found himself struggling for life with a terrible antagonist
BTS And how we worked
BTS 'The courtesies of ecclesiastical controversy
BTS It was a simple war of the castes Coolie versus Samurai and the coolie socialists were executed by tens of thousands
BTS An hour later taking advantage of the cut-offs around which the sled had to go Bill arrived
BTS An' I wisht this cold snap'd break he went on
BTS The word went up and down the valley and men saw to it that their dogs did not molest the Fighting Wolf
BTS It's all right he repeated
BTS But there were coastwise skippers I would have returned and killed when a man's strength came to me only the lines of my life were cast at the time in other places
BTS But I could not shake them as I had shaken the mechanics in their employ
BTS The hawk would also have eaten him
BTS It was a matter of principle and conscience
BTS As a revolutionist myself as one on the inside who knew the hopes and fears and secret plans of the revolutionists I am fitted to answer as very few are the charge that they were guilty of exploding the bomb in Congress
BTS It was a bribe father protested
BTS Dynamite appeared
BTS And again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground
BTS Wolf Larsen had sat about listening to my repairing the windlass and talking with Maud and me upon indifferent subjects
BTS In point of fact the three actions of perceiving determining and responding were sequential
BTS This is the end of the Everhard Manuscript
BTS There were flushed and angry faces at the table and withal a measure of awe
BTS That you should not answer is intolerable Ernest replied gravely
BTS I think you can now fire your father's legs back into the grave to him
BTS I was painfully aware of my likeness to a scarecrow
BTS I asked
BTS And on this count you cannot answer me here to-night face to face any more than can your whole class answer the million and a half of revolutionists in the United States
BTS Some time ago you were fighting the Milk Trust Ernest said to him
BTS A circle of the gleaming eyes had drawn about their camp
BTS In the late spring a great trouble came to White Fang
BTS She rode for days till they fell in the traces and the sled stood still
BTS Numbers of the passengers were leaping overboard
BTS The land itself ceased at the county road
BTS ' You are aware of your impotency
BTS Now it won't explode at all
BTS Hump he said at last I must get into my bunk
BTS Good-morning Mr
BTS Latimer cried
BTS I cannot give the further particulars of the horrible scene that followed
BTS He had been born in the working class though he was a descendant of the old line of Everhards that for over two hundred years had lived in America
BTS The deck was continually awash with the sea which came inboard over the rail and through the scuppers
BTS I can remember I can think and reason
BTS He was the only man who was not out of his bunk and he was jubilant in that he possessed no bruises to advertise that he had had a hand in the night's work
BTS All went well until I aimed a blow at an outlying cow's head and fell short
BTS I was wondering
BTS My woman my one small woman I said my free hand petting her shoulder in the way all lovers know though never learn in school
BTS the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church resolved that slavery is recognized in both the Old and the New Testaments and is not condemned by the authority of God
BTS My
BTS It was a clear day and the sun was shining
BTS The witnesses had given only the evidence that helped the other side
BTS How long this lasted I have no conception for a blankness intervened of which I remember no more than one remembers of troubled and painful sleep
BTS The shot missed and the next moment I was screaming and motioning the signals
BTS And in prison while awaiting trial he suffocated himself under his blankets
BTS He had expected all hell to break loose and here it was
BTS He had done his work well
BTS Illuminating oil was becoming all profit
BTS I ran across it in Spencer
BTS Little more I saw of the Chicago Commune
BTS It was not until Weedon Scott put the harness on White Fang and worked him that he understood
BTS His two dogs were missing and he well knew that they had served as a course in the protracted meal which had begun days before with Fatty the last course of which would likely be himself in the days to follow
BTS But he had little time to marvel at the transformation
BTS That will be a good name for that despotism the Iron Heel
BTS It does not matter whether it is in one year ten or a thousand--your class shall be dragged down
BTS Henderson seems the best of the hunters a slow-going fellow and hard to rouse
BTS In the end with loud protestations that he could lose like a gentleman the cook's last money was staked on the game and lost
BTS Thank God we are not scientists Dr
BTS He never had enough and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs
BTS Isn't that so Kerfoot
BTS Thenceforward he would be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows spears and clubs
BTS And now for the first time in my life I found myself responsible for some one else
BTS The inferno was still raging
BTS We bought our groceries from them
BTS If this man-animal intended harm White Fang knew that he could not escape it
BTS The frost was in his feet and he kept lifting first one fore-foot and then the other
BTS Also he learned that but brief time elapsed between his sounding of the alarm and Grey Beaver coming to his aid
BTS We're dead safe he assured them with a laugh
BTS No more was Spitz a leader greatly to be feared
BTS She shook her head
BTS The pilot-boat Lady Mine Wolf Larsen answered grimly
BTS From every hill slope came the trickle of running water the music of unseen fountains
BTS He would not have ventured so long a trip had he not expected generous profits
BTS The Ghost was deserted
BTS The god remained quiet made no movement
BTS I'm blamed if I can see how he works it out that you're the boss
BTS One could have read the finest print with ease
BTS This belt was the most salient thing about him
BTS He crawled over to his mate and tried to persuade her to get up
BTS His fellow-socialists could not agree with him
BTS And she clapped her hands and declared that she was hugely pleased
BTS Not you
BTS Dave and Sol-leks dripping blood from a score of wounds were fighting bravely side by side
BTS This senator was the tool and the slave the little puppet of a brutal uneducated machine boss
BTS One thing I was beginning to feel and that was that I could never again be quite the same man I had been
BTS As though I stood in need of their money
BTS White Fang had learned to turn suddenly upon the pursuer that was ahead of the pack and thoroughly to rip him up before the pack could arrive
BTS That's your look-out
BTS You merely questioned their morality
BTS Buck remembered the man in the red sweater and retreated slowly
BTS Think of the long rest this winter was her reply to my remonstrances
BTS The world is ours we are its lords and ours it shall remain
BTS Nor were we confined to the refuge itself
BTS There are far more unions outside of this combination than in it
BTS Three copies of it are extant
BTS and it would like to go in and eat them if it dared
BTS She was a mulatto woman and I noticed that her face was haggard with great circles under the eyes while the eyes themselves were wide with some haunting fear
BTS That is the beauty of it
BTS The gods held the power of life and death over their subjects and the gods were jealous of their power
BTS He laughed shrewdly
BTS Jackson was a fool
BTS Have you ever paused for a moment to consider our appearance
BTS You are like a frigate bird swooping down upon the boobies and robbing them of the fish they have caught
BTS But for some time longer he sat and brooded the two remaining dogs crouching and trembling at his feet
BTS I had gone camping but once in my life and then I left the party almost at its start and returned to the comforts and conveniences of a roof
BTS I had been caught up in a monstrous flood that was sweeping me I knew not whither
BTS On the morning of the third day shortly after eight bells a cry that the boat was sighted came down from Smoke at the masthead
BTS We will break the machines
BTS I became a member of a section--that was in the day of the S
BTS was his unceasing lament
BTS and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went down into the land of timber and streams
BTS They were shrewd-faced interesting men and they talked with simplicity and clearness
BTS that too too flattering review

BTS I left Mr
BTS And they were unconscious that they had made this sound
BTS And with the coming of the night brooding and mourning by the pool Buck became alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the Yeehats had made He stood up listening and scenting
BTS It reminds me too strongly of a rat in a trap
BTS They tied my arms while they lived
BTS They led him from the platform to prevent him from uttering more heresy
BTS He seemed to brace himself up and lean backward against the air as he stared at me
BTS If ever a creature was the enemy of its kind White Fang was that creature
BTS and so it was that I schooled myself to understand his work
BTS After a few hours of waiting when daylight had come the audience and the dog with which he was to fight arrived

BTS I am proud of you Maud
BTS There is no Republican Party
BTS Delicate as was the situation not alone in this but in other ways I flattered myself that I was able to deal delicately with it

BTS We could not determine whether the balloon had been manned by comrades or enemies
BTS Precious lot you know about dogs her brother sneered
BTS That is the capitalists had striven to placate the workers by interesting them financially in their work
BTS White Fang pricked his ears and investigated it suspiciously managing to look at the same time both at the meat and the god alert for any overt act his body tense and ready to spring away at the first sign of hostility
BTS Then I'll break his neck Scott retorted continuing his shoving and wedging with the revolver muzzle
BTS Jackson who had lost his arm in the Sierra Mills and who had been the cause of my own conversion into a revolutionist I never saw again

BTS The suppression of the book is a precipitation
BTS The schooner heeled over far out from the perpendicular was bowing and plunging into the long Pacific roll
BTS it dripped from our rigging overhead
BTS How I hated him
BTS I took the two women of the street to my palace and they are going to stay with me
BTS I had brought the customary liquor glasses but Wolf Larsen frowned shook his head and signalled with his hands for me to bring the tumblers

BTS Seven again
BTS The Cockney popped out of the galley
BTS So he was content when he had overthrown and slashed wide the throat of one of their dogs to drop back and let the pack go in and do the cruel finishing work
BTS All eyes watched it coming even Wolf Larsen's
BTS Got to take a gamble
BTS Nothing serious Mr
BTS It is on record that Theodore Roosevelt at that time President of the United States said in 1905 A
BTS But the man whose hand he had bitten was angry
BTS The 'Frisco Reds pledged themselves to his execution
BTS It was the old indomitable terrible Wolf Larsen imprisoned somewhere within that flesh which had once been so invincible and splendid
BTS she cried
BTS There was an ominous and worried expression on their faces
BTS And they work--in the mind
BTS Their stringy muscles seemed founts of inexhaustible energy
BTS Such fearful treatment of the great Colonel Van Gilbert was unheard of undreamed of impossible to believe--the great Colonel Van Gilbert before whom judges trembled when he arose in court

BTS He crouched down under the impending blow his hair bristling but his teeth still keeping tight hold of the rabbit
BTS Father was jubilant but Ernest was alarmed
BTS Full into the firelight with a stealthy sidelong movement glided a doglike animal
BTS It was warfare dark and devious replete with intrigue and conspiracy plot and counterplot
BTS This man this captain is a brute a demon and one can never tell what will be his next fantastic act
BTS When at last he came to a stop he gave one last agonised yell and then a long whimpering wail
BTS She was so many-sided so many-mooded protean-mooded I called her
BTS One of them was a big snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen who had been brought away by a whaling captain and who had later accompanied a Geological Survey into the Barrens
BTS Nor was this merely talk
BTS The wall inside which he had thought himself as suddenly leaped back before him to an immeasurable distance
BTS Matt commented
BTS Time and again White Fang had attempted to knock Cherokee off his feet
BTS Also its appearance had changed
BTS There are nearly a million coal miners
BTS he escorted Mollie and Alice the Judge's daughters on long twilight or early morning rambles
BTS No reflection on you doctor you understand
BTS Why then I shall club him came the answer
BTS Much of the Wild had been lost so that to them the Wild was the unknown the terrible the ever-menacing and ever warring
BTS But there was no danger
BTS Ernest demanded
BTS Never had I seen so profound a despair as that which I saw on his face the face of Wolf Larsen the fighter the strong man the indomitable one
BTS It was a pursuit like unto that of the Universal Solvent of the mediaeval alchemists
BTS The hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was
BTS Then it was that no cuff nor sharp word was necessary before they could pat him
BTS I often wondered why Wolf Larsen did not kill him and make an end of it
BTS Buck had sprung in on the instant
BTS She draws out the dog an' then all the rest pitches in an' eats 'm up
BTS It was what I may call the aristocratic ethic or the master ethic
BTS the last of the line was blown up in a pump-house by a bomb during a petty revolt of the miners in the Indian Territory

BTS Then jump for the topsails and spread them quick as God'll let you the quicker you do it the easier you'll find it
BTS The lazy brutes I'll show them he cried preparing to lash out at them with the whip
BTS From his confession we learn that he was not a criminal
BTS Then he turned and bent over White Fang standing by his side
BTS In fact there was nothing equivocal about him
BTS Hal's theory which he practised on others was that one must get hardened
BTS One day not long after he came to the edge of the forest where a narrow stretch of open land sloped down to the Mackenzie
BTS I who even in the most flagrant crimes had denied the justice and righteousness of capital punishment
BTS And none of them knew how to fight
BTS she cried
BTS We called the last meal of the day supper in our new environment
BTS Nor did he scorn to do battle with a weasel as hungry as himself and many times more ferocious
BTS The psychology of it is sadly tangled and yet I could read the workings of his mind as clearly as though it were a printed book
BTS How can you know anything about the working class
BTS When they attacked the working class he always retorted The pot calling the kettle black
BTS I saw it all from the top of an office building
BTS Life as he had known it not only had had no place in it for much that he now did
BTS But no fool dog ought to be fool enough to go off an' commit suicide that way
BTS And there were so many gods
BTS Was it not true
BTS The she-wolf was angry
BTS It was painted black and from the talk of the hunters of their poaching exploits I recognized it as a United States revenue cutter
BTS I know that I slipped down into the steerage in a daze and that I was just beginning the ascent to the deck a loaded shot-gun in my hands when I heard the startled cry There's five men in that boat
BTS I noted that the boats were missing
BTS What happened after this we can only surmise
BTS He remarked the pregnant silence of the forest
BTS And if against every man in the mills why not against every man in all the other mills and factories
BTS Stand by to let that jib over you Oofty
BTS Scott never desisted from his efforts though he looked up coolly and asked Your dog
BTS It made little audible gurgles which distracted me
BTS Power will be the arbiter as it always has been the arbiter
BTS But you've only got three cartridges Henry objected
BTS But behind the dogs there was nothing but space and into this space they flew when White Fang came on the scene made mad by laughter
BTS All eyes centred upon him
BTS His mate warned him irritably away and he curled up and slept in the entrance
BTS The driver went about his work and he called to Buck when he was ready to put him in his old place in front of Dave
BTS He had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought and his first experience taught him an unforgetable lesson
BTS I tell yer he's all right I could hear Leach saying as I went up the ladder
BTS He was greeted with snarls by his kind with curses and stones by his gods
BTS White Fang struggled and snarled but made no attempt to bite while he quickly quieted down at a sharp word from the master
BTS It was at the end of the discussion that Mr
BTS All right he said pridelessly tyke it or leave it I'll like yer none the less for it
BTS It was the worst hurt he had ever known
BTS And such a tangle halyards sheets guys down-hauls shrouds stays all washed about and back and forth and through and twined and knotted by the sea
BTS No labor consumes all of the total product that its wages will buy back
BTS It saddens me and gladdens me the gait with which we are leaving San Francisco behind and with which we are foaming down upon the tropics
BTS In point of fact it is not a thought
BTS Great armies of them are toiling now at the building of Ardis housed in wretched barracks where family life cannot exist and where decency is displaced by dull bestiality
BTS Men call him Death' Larsen
BTS Won't he run away
BTS At a crossing we noticed in the direction of the stockyards a gigantic pillar of smoke
BTS The rest were gone
BTS This secret service for the enemy must hamper him a lot but it's better than lying in a refuge
BTS Matt examined him
BTS Never mind expense
BTS His body thanks to his Scandinavian stock was fair as the fairest woman's
BTS And then I discovered that it was not laughter but hysteria
BTS Ernest asked when the merriment had subsided
BTS We of the labor hosts have conned that word over till our minds are all a-tingle with it
BTS In fact he never regarded the members of the family in any other light than possessions of the love-master
BTS Thomas Mugridge sir an' at yer service
BTS But I thought I marked a change in him a short while back
BTS He did not go far
BTS I came upon Kelly crouching to the lee of the forecastle scuttle his head on his knees his arms about his head in an attitude of unutterable despondency
BTS It was night-time
BTS and irate squaws told him to his face the while he eyed them alert and ready to dodge any quick-flung missile that he was a wolf and worthless and bound to come to an evil end
BTS But Kelly didn't amount to much was the reply
BTS Little did I dream the fateful part Jackson's arm was to play in my life
BTS The man's soul is his desires
BTS I'm goin' to get you Cooky he said and I'll get you hard
BTS Opposed to you are two great forces each of which is more powerful than you of the middle class
BTS It had gripped savagely hold of him and was about to wreak upon him some terrific hurt
BTS And when he could no longer rise they still continued to beat and kick him where he lay
BTS There was no hope for him
BTS On the scale I've worked out the circles of altitude and the lines of bearing
BTS Ballingford paraphrased
BTS In San Quentin prison he had proved incorrigible
BTS There was no bed-rock in them
BTS Sometimes like to-day I am given eight pair to finish before night
BTS Wolf Larsen shouted after
BTS Something was always happening
BTS But the moment laughter was turned upon him he would fly into a most terrible rage
BTS All hands tail on
BTS The master went out on horseback a great deal and to accompany him was one of White Fang's chief duties in life
BTS It was dawn of the second day
BTS And before more than one of the grown dogs White Fang's snarl enabled him to beat an honourable retreat
BTS I shall never walk again
BTS but my sleep on the Ghost had become most healthful and natural and soon the songs and cries died away my eyes closed and my consciousness sank down into the half-death of slumber
BTS Then it is an honest face for it looks what I feel
BTS He was not responsible
BTS Outlined against the clear blue of the sky he had the appearance of an enormous spider crawling along the tracery of its web
BTS His lambs must be fed bread and butter and potatoes and meat
BTS and that even the eyes had changed expression and into them were coming watchfulness and measurement and a light none other than of battle
BTS It was like Fate itself and as inexorable
BTS First she ate the dog-food
BTS And Aristotle was a metaphysician
BTS An' 'ow yer feelin' now sir
BTS Ernest had already questioned father's policy of having socialists and labor leaders at his house and of openly attending socialist meetings
BTS Well I got him first Donnelly said with pride
BTS Nevertheless he ran with his head even with the shoulder of his one-eyed elder
BTS Nothing happened
BTS Up to her old tricks she too had fled the inhospitable fires of the gods and gone back to her old refuge to give birth to her young
BTS What is it
BTS It was an exact duplicate of our train though it contained no passengers
BTS Pig
BTS A puff had caught the schooner and he was forced to put the wheel up rapidly to keep her out of the wind
BTS But her fingers closed on mine
BTS The life that was within him knew that it was the one way out the way he was predestined to tread
BTS And a blubber-eating fur-clad god can exist and work--in the mind
BTS This it did and was flying down-stream in a current as swift as a mill-race when Hans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly
BTS For she knew that in the lynx's lair was a litter of kittens and she knew the lynx for a fierce bad-tempered creature and a terrible fighter
BTS Besides no matter how small the good nevertheless his little inadequate wail will be productive of some good in the revolution and every little bit counts
BTS Think so
BTS Eh
BTS We traced him from the state hospital for the insane at Napa to the one in Stockton and from there to the one in the Santa Clara Valley called Agnews and there the trail ceased
BTS If you were in San Francisco this afternoon you'd have to walk
BTS And even a multitude of angels can dance on the point of a needle--in the mind Ernest went on reflectively
BTS but still no further away no endlessness of life
BTS Not so was the conduct of George Leach the erstwhile cabin-boy
BTS They rolled over and over in the powdery snow
BTS They had seen other sleds depart over the Pass for Dawson or come in from Dawson but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs
BTS It crushed them with the weight of unending vastness and unalterable decree
BTS He slunk forlornly through the deserted camp smelling the rubbish-heaps and the discarded rags and tags of the gods
BTS While I toiled at rigging the foremast Maud sewed on canvas ready always to drop everything and come to my assistance when more hands than two were required
BTS Then I understood
BTS I agree with all that you have said
BTS Every woollen filament of our garments every hair of our heads and faces was jewelled with a crystal globule
BTS I was workin' overtime an' I guess I was tired out some
BTS I should have been crushed had it not been for Garthwaite
BTS You try it then
BTS You would like to go back to the land which is a favourable place for your kind of piggishness
BTS Later when we went back into the world we were separated much
BTS But Maud was by my side passing her hand soothingly through my hair as though I were a child and saying There there
BTS The months passed by
BTS Not in three guesses father laughed
BTS White Fang was in the process of finding himself
BTS As fast as the ascertained facts of science have overthrown their subjective explanations of things they have made new subjective explanations of things including explanations of the latest ascertained facts
BTS There was a leap a flash of teeth a sharp exclamation
BTS They were all tied to the merciless industrial machine
BTS What happens
BTS We were lovers of Humanity
BTS The fingers spread slightly falling apart of their own weight and the pencil rolled away
BTS I'll have some talks with you some time
BTS And we had been compelled to row in a dead calm practically every inch of the way
BTS Thus they slowly diverged toward the west drawing farther away from the remainder of the boats in their line
BTS In the end the god tossed the meat on the snow at White Fang's feet
BTS At last he lay at the master's feet into whose possession he now surrendered himself voluntarily body and soul
BTS It is a struggle of classes
BTS The dogs clustered together in fear now and again snarling menacingly as a pair of eyes drew close
BTS And yet I could not imagine him lying prone in death
BTS But there is only so much gold and not much of it in the world Ernest objected
BTS I do not ask you to prove it to me
BTS Mugridge and his behaviour and carriage were insufferable as he showed me my duties
BTS He sat down as before in the same spot several feet away
BTS But Humphrey  she began to protest in a queer husky voice
BTS Whet whet whet it went all day long
BTS I think I'll go and see
BTS In the interval the city had disappeared
BTS He knew only that the velvet-furred kitten was meat and he ate and waxed happier with every mouthful
BTS But there's one thing I know sure an' that there's no gettin' away from
BTS Fresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs were to take the places of those worthless for the trail
BTS But Ernest's glance took me in and questioned impatiently past and around the room
BTS Life had become a hell to him
BTS For Thornton however his love seemed to grow and grow
BTS It's meself that knows
BTS This was to be my first night on the mattress and I knew I should sleep the sweeter because she had made it
BTS And it is an irreconcilable conflict
BTS She was an apt pupil and soon learned to keep the course to luff in the puffs and to cast off the sheet in an emergency
BTS This seal had been stamped upon him again and ineradicably on his second return from the Wild when the long famine was over and there was fish once more in the village of Grey Beaver
BTS It has been maintained in a fair state of preservation and the curious visitor may to-day tread its labyrinths to the assembly hall where without doubt occurred the scene described by Avis Everhard
BTS Out of the vast army of the unemployed the strike-breakers were recruited
BTS 'Twas called a sad accident but I met the boat-puller in Yokohama an' the straight iv it was given me
BTS This I thought no more than natural considering the part I had played in investigating the case of Jackson's arm
BTS Wolf Larsen stooped coolly to the Cockney and pressed with thumb and finger at the rear of the jaws and below the ears
BTS Along came the steam-engine and labor-saving machinery
BTS Our reply shall be couched in terms of lead
BTS How does he do it
BTS We even went on picnics to isolated spots we knew where we remained all day going before daylight and returning after dark
BTS Woven into her being was the memory of countless crimes he and his had perpetrated against her ancestry
BTS He ran him into a blind channel in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way
BTS I shall be able to appreciate the lives of the working people hereafter
BTS No mere dog could have done what he did
BTS Wolf that he was and unprecedented as it was the gods had sanctioned his presence and they the dogs of the gods could only recognise this sanction
BTS And then I think of my daughter and I cannot work
BTS This is the first time I have ever been in one
BTS At my direction Maud fetched a rope
BTS Dolly the last husky added to the team at Dyea had a badly torn throat
BTS You must remember Miss Brewster that you are a new inhabitant of this little world and that you do not yet understand the laws which operate within it
BTS Fear surged through him again
BTS Here and there savage dogs rushed upon him but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled for he was learning fast and they let him go his way unmolested
BTS There's one now I said pointing to a young bull in the water
BTS What's her name then
BTS To-morrow's papers will merely mention that the Bishop is in poor health that he has been working too hard and that he broke down last night
BTS It was because of her loss that she paid no attention to the winged bolt of the sky
BTS Some days they did not make ten miles
BTS I tell you yes an' broke to harness
BTS All that saved White Fang from death was the loose skin of his neck and the thick fur that covered it
BTS he giggled
BTS His love partook of the nature of worship dumb inarticulate a silent adoration
BTS You have received the command from your masters to vote against it
BTS ' sez I
BTS He has been attempting to curry favour and reinstate himself in the good graces of the captain by carrying tales of the men forward
BTS In the meantime the rest of the working class was more harshly treated
BTS I had not thought my victory was so far-reaching and complete but I resolved to let go nothing I had gained
BTS He was too quick for them too formidable too wise
BTS He was appalled by the selfishness he encountered and what had surprised him even more than that was the absence of intellectual life
BTS I demanded
BTS You are not exactly afraid
BTS The man who gave me the order was one of the oligarchs I could tell that by his speech though I did not know his name nor see his face
BTS What if he should be feigning this
BTS To throw one's whole strength and weight on the oars and to feel the boat checked in its forward lunge by the heavy drag behind was not exactly exhilarating
BTS But I'm goin' to lay for her
BTS And he could hear the crashing of their bodies through the undergrowth and the noises they made in the night
BTS Not that
BTS And was I too one of his swine
BTS He became malignant and morose
BTS A man's voice screamed once in horror and anguish
BTS Constantly my thought swung back to him as the compass to the Pole
BTS Perrault took a hand
BTS and as I paced the deck hour after hour I found myself afflicted with Wolf Larsen's repulsive ideas
BTS They were poor people and unlettered
BTS One great factor that helped to swell the socialist vote was the destruction of Hearst
BTS He had bred true to the straight wolf-stock in fact he had bred true to old One Eye himself physically with but a single exception and that was he had two eyes to his father's one
BTS He stood where he had arisen opened his mouth and broke out the long heart-broken puppy wail
BTS Wolf Larsen repeated his manoeuvre holding off and then rounding up to windward and drifting down upon it
BTS The dairymen were wiped out of existence
BTS We had planned to strike our first blow at the nervous system of the Oligarchy
BTS I tried to tell him my gladness at meeting him and that he must come right home with me
BTS They made their bread with baking-powder
BTS For in that instant the she-wolf leaped sidewise from the trail into the clump of spruce trees and disappeared
BTS Why did you lose the case
BTS In the end they fell back on a woman one of our comrades and none other than Anna Roylston
BTS So when we left him he lay handcuffed hand and foot
BTS Matt took hold of White Fang ready to pull when Cherokee's jaws should be loosened
BTS I nodded my head and she having recovered herself waited expectantly
BTS There were his gods and there were other gods and between them there was a difference
BTS The Grangers were powerless
BTS We with the survivors swept back in mad retreat
BTS but he emerged from the mass like an eel bleeding at the mouth the offending shirt ripped into tatters and sprang for the main-rigging
BTS White Fang's strength was developed by the long hours on trail and the steady toil at the sled
BTS Step by step she was luring him away from the security of his human companionship
BTS the Almighty hath not built Here for his envy
BTS She even went so far as to murmur that they were non-essentials and that my trip after them might be inexpedient
BTS He obeyed his natural impulses until they ran him counter to some law
BTS I have little quarrel with the way you have depicted it
BTS You don't mean to say
BTS What shall I do then
BTS Maud was pale but composed my eyes had gone instantly to her face and she was looking at me with mingled alarm and relief
BTS I mean that there is a shadow of something colossal and menacing that even now is beginning to fall across the land
BTS And besides young man I must tell you that you have said nothing new
BTS At the same instant Buck peered out where the spruce-bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders
BTS Before I go on I want to say a word for this comrade John Carlson a humble figure of the Revolution one of the countless faithful ones in the ranks
BTS A gloomy breakfast was eaten and the four remaining dogs were harnessed to the sled
BTS Somewhere within that tomb of the flesh still dwelt the soul of the man
BTS The hunters were snickering but she looked at me with a sympathy in her eyes which more than compensated for Wolf Larsen's nastiness
BTS Your hands are soft with the work others have performed for you
BTS others stood in groups looking on and talking
BTS and that it must come from wealthy personages who could not but be offended by the swerving of the university from its high ideal of the passionless pursuit of passionless intelligence
BTS she asked
BTS There were warnings but I did not heed them
BTS And it was the Plutocracy through its secret agents of course that encouraged the Grange Party and even spread it to the cities into the ranks of the dying middle class
BTS Then he returned and started his dogs
BTS he warned
BTS You were light in my darkness but now I too see the light
BTS But White Fang was not demonstrative
BTS Then the rope was removed and he was flung into a cagelike crate
BTS It would merely mean that various dangers to us were harmlessly destroying one another
BTS He had to forage for himself and he foraged well though he was oft-times a plague to the squaws in consequence
BTS White Fang was too helpless to defend himself and it would have gone hard with him had not Grey Beaver's foot shot out lifting Lip-lip into the air with its violence so that he smashed down to earth a dozen feet away
BTS On the contrary he seemed kindly disposed toward her too kindly to suit her for he was prone to run near to her and when he ran too near it was she who snarled and showed her teeth
BTS At the front were the strongest
BTS As the Ghost rolled her side out of water the boat was lifted snugly against her and before the return roll came we had heaved it in over the side and turned it bottom up on the deck
BTS He was a small man to begin with
BTS Over the city of the Mercenaries we saw a great captive war-balloon that burst even as we looked at it and fell in flaming wreckage toward the earth
BTS The she-wolf the young leader on her left and the one-eyed elder on her right led their half of the pack down to the Mackenzie River and across into the lake country to the east
BTS The team-dogs were swept back against the cliff at the first onset
BTS Then he came in like a fresh-caught fish on a line clearing the rail generously and striking the deck in a heap on hands and knees and rolling over
BTS You see all those books
BTS I consider it wrong and criminal to appeal to all that is narrow and brutal in the working class
BTS He whined placatingly squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions and even ventured as a bribe for peace to lick Buck's face with his warm wet tongue
BTS Their strength was used to give united strength to the Oligarchy
BTS The earth was carpeted with the slain and a final charge of cavalry with trampling of horses' hoofs revolvers and sabres crushed the wounded into the ground
BTS The members of the favored unions were branded as traitors and in saloons and brothels on the streets and at work and in fact everywhere they were assaulted by the comrades they had so treacherously deserted
BTS Scott sprang toward him drawing his fist back to strike
BTS He awoke as gently as he slept
BTS the slaughter of the cotton operatives by machine-guns became classic as the most terrific execution ever achieved by modern war machines
BTS He's bent upon giving them a lesson that's all
BTS There was a great snarling and growling a clashing of teeth and a flurry of bodies
BTS She's a-comin'
BTS We both mean the same thing the large capitalists or the trusts
BTS Nor I until I knew you I answered
BTS Bishop Morehouse nodded
BTS But Wolf Larsen leaving his victim for the moment and with one of his tremendous springs gained my side and flung me into the far corner of the cabin
BTS Can we make it work
BTS They had not conceived it possible
BTS An eternity of piggishness
BTS And for a week this state of affairs was maintained
BTS Mugridge' sez 'e to me Mugridge' sez 'e you've missed yer vokytion
BTS There wasn't enough powder in it
BTS As I buttered a piece of bread my eyes chanced to rest upon my hand
BTS As we passed the point the whole cove burst upon our view a half-moon of white sandy beach upon which broke a huge surf and which was covered with myriads of seals
BTS These things the oligarchs will do because they cannot help doing them
BTS Why then in the United States to-day are there three million child laborers
BTS They have enabled us to sell more abroad which means that we'll be compelled to consume less at home
BTS This scheme was eminently successful
BTS A dainty eater he found that his mates finishing first robbed him of his unfinished ration
BTS The result was a sharp peck on the end of his nose that made him cower down and ki-yi
BTS All day long he limped in agony and camp once made lay down like a dead dog
BTS Her hand leapt out at once to mine
BTS It tried to retreat before him
BTS But after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously than ever
BTS You don't say that you like to squeeze profits out of others and that you are making all the row because others are squeezing your profits out of you
BTS These men placed no value whatever upon their own lives and it was they who totally destroyed the great Mercenary city of Bellona along with its population of over a hundred thousand souls
BTS Still their strength went down
BTS She shook her head with a shudder
BTS We were like good comrades and we grew better comrades as the days went by
BTS Buck saw and his mates saw and they knew that this thing was very close to them
BTS When they threatened he cowered down
BTS But he was not to be caught napping this time
BTS One Eye with pointed interested ears laughed at her and beyond outlined against the white light she could see the brush of his tail waving good-naturedly
BTS It is absurd
BTS spluttered the Skookum Bench king
BTS They composed the watch on deck and it was the ship's custom in good weather to let the watch sleep with the exception of the officer the helmsman and the look-out
BTS And if you want to laugh at me you have my consent and forgiveness
BTS And bring out the cigars and the whisky you'll find in my berth
BTS and White Fang licked his chops and decided that such fare was good
BTS But the courts I urged
BTS was lying in the Tombs Prison New York City awaiting trial for murder
BTS He never lost his head
BTS She followed running swiftly
BTS You can't fool my ears
BTS Behind every steel-like contraction of a muscle lay another steel-like contraction and another and another apparently without end
BTS A savage expression flitted across it
BTS One of the men was General Altendorff
BTS He now became the enemy of all things and more ferocious than ever
BTS Baer with the enunciation of the following principle The rights and interests of the laboring man will be protected by the Christian men to whom God in His infinite wisdom has given the property interests of the country
BTS Man and the claims of man no longer bound him
BTS Among the Revolutionists were many surgeons and in vivisection they attained marvellous proficiency
BTS He was lying on his side dead where he had dragged himself an arrow protruding head and feathers from either side of his body
BTS Ernest demanded bluntly
BTS To make it worse the light of the sky was obscured and snow began to fall a raw moist melting clinging snow slippery under foot that hid from him the landscape he traversed and that covered over the inequalities of the ground so that the way of his feet was more difficult and painful
BTS and the time was to come when the she-wolf for her grey cub's sake would venture the left fork and the lair in the rocks and the lynx's wrath
BTS The dead and dying went down and made room
BTS And break it out and walk off with it for a hundred yards John Thornton said coolly
BTS Do you know Dr
BTS The sharp clang of a passing ambulance at the corner gave him a start
BTS he cried
BTS The jib itself was beginning to slap partially filling and emptying with sharp reports
BTS but wait until the favored unions develop caste
BTS I was mistaken when I said that I was in the good graces of all
BTS Four billion dollars of wealth is produced in one year in the United States
BTS I've been in orspital arf my bleedin' life
BTS Had there been a steady breeze it would not have been so bad but the Ghost was rolling emptily in a long sea and with each roll the canvas flapped and boomed and the halyards slacked and jerked taut
BTS And so it came about that both the Bishop and I accepted Ernest's challenges
BTS The next I knew after that I was awakened out of a sound sleep by a man who walked up and down close beside me
BTS I had looked for almost any sort of explosion on the Cockney's part but to my surprise he did not appear aware of what I was doing
BTS One of the grooms ran to the rescue
BTS The weakness in their position lies in that they are merely business men
BTS Hump I have studied some grammar in my time and I think your tenses are tangled
BTS It seems that he has been seal-hunting regularly each season for a dozen years and is accounted one of the two or three very best boat-steerers in both fleets
BTS Guarding against being trailed I made a rush of it for the Emergency Hospital
BTS The fact man the irrefragable fact
BTS At this moment still running at top speed White Fang became suddenly aware of an attack from the side
BTS And best of all I felt myself the protector of my loved one
BTS The Aurora was the first steamboat of the year for the Outside and her decks were jammed with prosperous adventurers and broken gold seekers all equally as mad to get to the Outside as they had been originally to get to the Inside
BTS They threw themselves against the breast-bands dug their feet into the packed snow got down low to it and put forth all their strength
BTS I overheard Henderson and another of the hunters Standish a Californian talking about it
BTS I came to in the midst of wild movement
BTS But bit by bit whenever the chance offered he was getting more of the loose skin and fur in his mouth
BTS White Fang was in his way
BTS You are quite a figure
BTS We must stand together without appearing to do so in secret alliance
BTS His rages and battles were pleasures
BTS His own face was passion-wrought
BTS But profit-sharing as a system was ridiculous and impossible
BTS Why don't you shoot
BTS There must have been laughter in hell at the spectacle
BTS Matt shouted warningly but too late
BTS Johnson shouted in my ear as we successfully came through the attendant deluge and I knew he referred not to Wolf Larsen's seamanship but to the performance of the Ghost herself
BTS I can never get them clean again she wailed nor soften the weather-beat
BTS It is my wretched nerves
BTS While all his ship was getting drunk as fast as it could he remained sober
BTS For the first time she met him with a kindly manner
BTS Then he tried to be more dignified and the master laughed harder than before
BTS I never could find anything when they had departed
BTS And there
BTS But Wolf Larsen ignored that worthy turning at once to the cabin-boy
BTS The milk he had sucked with his first flickering life was milk transformed directly from meat and now at a month old when his eyes had been open for but a week he was beginning himself to eat meat meat half-digested by the she-wolf and disgorged for the five growing cubs that already made too great demand upon her breast
BTS He tripped them up with facts ambuscaded them with facts bombarded them with broadsides of facts
BTS The bankers and all the trusts for that matter had likewise long since loaned colossal amounts of money to the farmers
BTS There were other things on the sled blankets an axe and a coffee-pot and frying-pan
BTS He snarled softly up at the thing of fear watching keenly the deportment of the hands
BTS I could have kissed them had I dared even then in my rage the touch of them was so sweet so very sweet
BTS Came days of storm days and nights of storm when the ocean menaced us with its roaring whiteness and the wind smote our struggling boat with a Titan's buffets
BTS Priest-like he wore a robe more white than foam And king-like swathed himself in royal red Three crowns of gold rose high upon his head
BTS They were losing all touch and sympathy with the rest of the people and in fact were developing their own class morality and consciousness
BTS But if it was a bluff he intended it did not work
BTS He was cat-footed and lithe and strong always strong
BTS It was impossible for one uninformed to escape the vague yet certain feeling that all the land was ripe for the revolt that had already begun to break out
BTS The work was done
BTS The air was thick and murky with the smoke of it
BTS Then it is good to be an anarchist
BTS Formerly White Fang had been merely the enemy of his kind withal a ferocious enemy
BTS Mine I knew were speaking beyond the will of my speech
BTS At the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand
BTS We elected a governor of Colorado and the legislature refused to permit him to take office
BTS In years and years not one of them has been in contact with a good woman or within the influence or redemption which irresistibly radiates from such a creature
BTS It was a strength we are wont to associate with things primitive with wild animals and the creatures we imagine our tree-dwelling prototypes to have been a strength savage ferocious alive in itself the essence of life in that it is the potency of motion the elemental stuff itself out of which the many forms of life have been moulded
BTS And then the capitalists controlling the legislative and judicial machinery of the state of Colorado charged the miners with the crime and came very near to convicting them
BTS I paused laughed at myself and almost abandoned the chase
BTS He was self-educated had taught himself German and French and at that time was earning a meagre living by translating scientific and philosophical works for a struggling socialist publishing house in Chicago
BTS It is all right I assured her
BTS An' now we make good time
BTS But with this difference Ernest laughed
BTS So I tucked a blanket and pillow under my arm and went up on deck
BTS At harness-up time he tried to crawl to his driver
BTS From inside the door came a low whining and sobbing
BTS Paper and ink she laughed
BTS Hi
BTS The basic life that was in him took charge of him
BTS The Martinez heeled over sharply and there was a crashing and rending of timber
BTS It was idle he knew to get between a fool and his folly
BTS Ernest could not get them seriously to fear the coming of the Oligarchy
BTS But to him in appearance and action and impulse still clung the Wild
BTS She gave no sign that she had heard though the expression of her eyes changed to one of inexpressible loathing as she started to turn away
BTS Backward from the apex his head slanted down to his neck and forward it slanted uncompromisingly to meet a low and remarkably wide forehead
BTS And here I have been lying warm as toast
BTS I watched fascinated
BTS He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem
BTS Though the grizzled old fellow could see only on one side against the youth and vigour of the other he brought into play the wisdom of long years of experience
BTS He hauled the rope up and hid it and before he went away called down to me a cheerful parting
BTS And you are Humphrey Van Weyden she said gazing back at me with equal solemnity and awe
BTS I had much for which to thank Wolf Larsen was my thought as we went along the path between the jostling harems
BTS One man can produce cotton cloth for two hundred and fifty people woollens for three hundred and boots and shoes for a thousand
BTS Now he was upon it
BTS When his food was shoved in to him he growled like a wild animal
BTS The socialists were in a pitiful minority and they knew that their end was near
BTS Gad sir
BTS At once began to rise the cries that were fiercely sad cries that called through the darkness and cold to one another and answered back
BTS Wolf Larsen made the same demand of the sailors
BTS We will not enter into the squabbling over the division
BTS The very thing I mean
BTS From the head of the lawn on the first soft swell from the valley-level looked down the deep-porched many-windowed house
BTS he commanded sweeping his arm out and over the chasm
BTS And you would scarcely demand a little girl of nine to earn her own living
BTS The wolf whirled about pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of Joe and of all cornered husky dogs snarling and bristling clipping his teeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps
BTS But at the word assassination the uproar broke out again
BTS The socialist press of the country took up the fight however and throughout the reading portion of the working class it was known that the book had been suppressed
BTS Wolf Larsen underwent another bad attack of headache which lasted two days
BTS The other was lifting a megaphone to his lips
BTS And in that moment as I saw the harshness form in their faces and saw the fight-light flashing in their eyes I realized that not easily would they let their lordship of the world be wrested from them
BTS The last sensations of pain left him
BTS Buck's one hundred and forty pounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen
BTS These executions were not haphazard
BTS I turned and saw him standing just beneath the break of the poop on the port side of the galley
BTS The willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds
BTS Conditions favoured the undertaking
BTS In dim ways he recognised in man the animal that had fought itself to primacy over the other animals of the Wild
BTS and it was only by the exercise of an immense patience extending through many hours that he succeeded in gnawing through the stick
BTS But when he was thus separated from his fellows two or three of the younger bulls would charge back upon Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd
BTS To betray his trust would have been in his mind a thing undreamed
BTS But Bishop Morehouse turned out to have become interested in Ernest and was anxious for another meeting
BTS He had not been born right and he had not been helped any by the moulding he had received at the hands of society
BTS The mob was no more than twenty-five feet away when the machine-guns opened up
BTS Then the god spoke and at the first sound of his voice the hair rose on White Fang's neck and the growl rushed up in his throat
BTS He whined pleadingly and scurried playfully in and out of the underbrush
BTS They'd sooner eat grub than be grub
BTS Nevertheless the socialist landslide occurred
BTS CHAPTER VI By the following morning the storm had blown itself quite out and the Ghost was rolling slightly on a calm sea without a breath of wind
BTS And so it is in this anxious time of waiting that I shall write of my husband
BTS The fire crackled
BTS he laughed
BTS In short they alone by their unremitting toil and sacrifice stood between weak humanity and the all-devouring beast
BTS They had eaten a pair of Perrault's moose-hide moccasins chunks out of the leather traces and even two feet of lash from the end of Francois's whip
BTS Such rooms were museums entailing endless labor to keep clean
BTS I grew frightened at my thoughts
BTS The wretched militiamen found that their machine-guns had been tampered with and that the cartridges from the captured magazines did not fit their rifles
BTS In the end his money and goods and temper were all gone
BTS And as for you Johnson you'll get so tired of life before I'm through with you that you'll fling yourself over the side
BTS He ranged far and wide and slept but little in the lair that had now become cheerless and miserable
BTS It's my dog Hal replied wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back
BTS We had no more than begun work when the sound of my knocking and hammering brought Wolf Larsen
BTS to the good and to the clean and to the unclean
BTS For look you they dream of making lucky voyages which will bring them more money of becoming the mates of ships of finding fortunes in short of being in a better position for preying on their fellows of having all night in good grub and somebody else to do the dirty work
BTS But think Humphrey
BTS And believe me we foment no hatred
BTS The next moment his nose was laid open and he was staggering backward away from the meat
BTS Every urge of his being impelled him to spring upon the pack that cried at his heels but it was the will of the gods that this should not be
BTS What would you advise then
BTS Between them they ran him about for the better part of an hour
BTS Beauty Smith gave him a beating
BTS In fact I am afraid I do not understand politics
BTS Suppose I should disagree with everybody about the literary style of a book
BTS Get your traps aft into the mate's berth
BTS You stand on dead men's legs
BTS Buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent and load the sled
BTS Oh Van Weyden
BTS Confusion thrice confounded
BTS It was so much added fuel to the flame of his fierceness
BTS The hunters piled pell-mell out of the steerage but as Leach's tirade continued I saw that there was no levity in their faces
BTS and she worked only thirty years
BTS Py Jingo
BTS But we ain't got people an' money an' all the rest like him Henry rejoined
BTS Pertonwaithe's spacious walls beheld such a spectacle
BTS He stepped boldly out on it
BTS But as I was saying no one to-day is a free agent
BTS They were expressions of life and life is always happy when it is expressing itself
BTS Maud and I were astounded
BTS It gave him a tremendous advantage over his antagonists
BTS I had not imagined a human being could endure so much and still live and struggle on
BTS It was a saturnalia
BTS All my handiwork was strong none of it beautiful
BTS You are disgusted because the railroad has absorbed your profits
BTS Strong enough themselves to weather the storm that was largely their own brewing they turned loose and plundered the wrecks that floated about them
BTS In some way when Harrison was aloft the sheet jammed in the block through which it runs at the end of the gaff
BTS There was no doubt about it
BTS Yet its defeat did not put an end to the hard times
BTS At the same time as an institution they will become temporarily all-powerful
BTS Her face was of the sort that cannot but look well under all circumstances
BTS He alone in the days he had lived knew the secret of the hiding-place for which I was bound
BTS To live
BTS Calvin asserted positively
BTS Mit-sah and Kloo-kooch went with him
BTS How'd it happen
BTS Fully half-an-hour went by and then I saw Johnson and Louis in some sort of altercation
BTS Besides consider it a lesson
BTS This was in Michigan across the lake from Chicago
BTS I am yet a member and I yet pay my dues though it is very secret now
BTS His important part was played in drafting the new code after the Chicago Commune
BTS I heard a great infuriated bellow go up from Wolf Larsen and from Leach a snarling that was desperate and blood-curdling
BTS They raged and slaughtered and destroyed all over the city proper and were in turn destroyed
BTS The eyes only moved
BTS We young fellows have our work yet to do
BTS Who was Omar
BTS I had always been a book-worm
BTS I had half started forward to get over with what I was certain would be a stormy five minutes when a more violent suffocating paroxysm seized the unfortunate person who was lying on his back
BTS Understand
BTS His hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief and the right trouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle
BTS he answered
BTS I think tundra grass will do after all
BTS I scanned the sea with my glasses
BTS Once a full-grown female lynx was secured and this time White Fang fought for his life
BTS Bill shook his head
BTS I've had more cruel sufferin' than any ten men I 'ave
BTS But he had long since learned that there was such a thing as Chance or Opportunity and he continued to draw near
BTS That is a fact
BTS I knew you were here all the time
BTS A mile above the forks running velvet-footed as was his custom a gliding shadow that cautiously prospected each new vista of the trail he came upon later imprints of the large tracks he had discovered in the early morning
BTS When the beating was over White Fang was sick
BTS His mastery was rigid as steel
BTS If I should catch you by the throat thus his hand was about my throat and my breath was shut off and began to press the life out of you thus and thus your instinct of immortality will go glimmering and your instinct of life which is longing for life will flutter up and you will struggle to save yourself
BTS From under clefts among the rocks I gathered a few dry sticks and chips
BTS I looked at my watch
BTS Master of the steamship Macedonia seal-hunter was the answer
BTS He started for the companion stairs but turned his head for a final word
BTS With the destruction of Hearst and the Democratic Party there were only two paths for his following to take
BTS Late that afternoon we hove up anchor and got away
BTS Are you sick
BTS The driver examined him but could find nothing
BTS It was the same when he challenged the hawk down out of the sky
BTS We could never hide ourselves upon it
BTS It would have been entertainment
BTS The last dog had been driven back
BTS That's just it she began eagerly and broke off in sudden confusion
BTS It was just after the sun's futile effort to appear that Bill slipped the rifle from under the sled-lashings and said You keep right on Henry I'm goin' to see what I can see
BTS eight millions which he had thought taken care of for years to come at a good interest were suddenly dumped upon his doorstep and there set up a-squawking for a new home
BTS The weasel let go the cub and flashed at the she-wolf's throat missing but getting a hold on the jaw instead
BTS Their work was to blow up the magazines and to destroy the delicate mechanism of all the war machinery
BTS They found careers in applied science and many of them became great engineers
BTS I will I will Dr
BTS He was a thing of the wild come in from the wild to sit by John Thornton's fire rather than a dog of the soft Southland stamped with the marks of generations of civilization
BTS Buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt
BTS PART V CHAPTER I THE LONG TRAIL It was in the air
BTS And for the first time since the stabbing the Cockney had appeared outside the galley without his knife
BTS He would now destroy a big live thing
BTS In fact the few words we spoke could hardly be called a conversation
BTS The box was empty
BTS The Indians heard it too
BTS and all I can hope is he'll do it quick
BTS These he filled two-thirds full with undiluted whisky a gentleman's drink
BTS --he with his clarion call and war-noted voice and all the fine man's vigor of him
BTS To-morrow the Cause will rise again strong with wisdom and discipline
BTS Harrison ceased his progress and held on tightly
BTS How do you like my definition
BTS I had become convinced that Ernest was right when he sneered at charity as a poulticing of an ulcer
BTS He was quivering to it
BTS A twig that he thought a long way off would the next instant hit him on the nose or rake along his ribs
BTS He did not stir as I passed by him and went down into the cabin
BTS but this would be quite different from an unconsumable surplus
BTS Nothing worked
BTS The boat's stern touched the hard shingle
BTS Well well he made a mistake didn't he
BTS In past experience especially in dealing with squaws meat and punishment had often been disastrously related
BTS The days passed by and they kept together hunting their meat and killing and eating it in common
BTS That did not count
BTS Be careful
BTS By the time I had seen the lawyer who had handled Jackson's case and the two foremen and the superintendent at the mills who had testified I began to feel that there was something after all in Ernest's contention
BTS ha
BTS In his youth One Eye had once sniffed too near a similar apparently inert ball of quills and had the tail flick out suddenly in his face
BTS He did not waste any time
BTS The seas previously encountered were as ripples compared with these which ran a half-mile from crest to crest and which upreared I am confident above our masthead
BTS He could see the wolves flooding into the big living-room of the fort
BTS She made no reply and I knew my tone must have hurt her
BTS I know that my own kind could not have believed it possible
BTS Where was her solicitude for me I thought for me whom she had been afraid to have merely peep aboard
BTS With the exception of Lip-lip they were compelled to hunch together for mutual protection against the terrible enemy they had made
BTS For the first time I was seeing life
BTS Johnson was steering Leach bailing
BTS The roar of it no longer dinned upon his ears
BTS Complicated as it was it was carried through without a hitch and as a very creditable achievement it cheered us on in our work
BTS His words brought anxiety into the faces of the other hunters
BTS This task fell to Biedenbach and slung on a rope from above he toiled cunningly for the rest of the day till no sign remained
BTS Unless of course you have grown tired of my poor efforts
BTS I will live to a hundred
BTS The effect of all this was to rob White Fang of much of his puppyhood and to make him in his comportment older than his age
BTS He looked at me curiously
BTS Duty rose above fear and thieving gods learned to leave Grey Beaver's property alone
BTS With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air
BTS Anything warm would have been most gratifying
BTS He dropped the whip and shielded his throat with his arms
BTS Listen to them and find if it is hard to discover the most vital thing in their souls said Wolf Larsen
BTS Bill seemed to have forgotten his forebodings of the previous night and even waxed facetious with the dogs when at midday they overturned the sled on a bad piece of trail
BTS They served as leaders of troops and as lieutenants and captains of industry
BTS He shook his head in a bantering way and regarded me with laughing eyes
BTS but as he will tell you himself he knows nothing about it
BTS Wherefore is there in him little dog and much wolf
BTS There was an ache in my throat as though my heart were up in it
BTS I worked up ever since
BTS An' he went like greased lightnin' once he got started
BTS It maintains luxurious lobbies at every state capital and at the national capital
BTS I was a human soul in distress and yet no soul fore or aft betrayed sufficient sympathy to come to my aid
BTS His eyes chanced upon the cook
BTS Ernest's prophecy was strikingly fulfilled in the cases of Mr
BTS It could not be--not in those faded overalls too long in the legs and frayed at the bottoms
BTS The stream moved slowly while from it arose groans and lamentations cursings babblings of senility hysteria and insanity
BTS He did not know what love was
BTS The shark was not in the reckoning
BTS We spoke no more though we had become too used to one another for the silence to be awkward
BTS Excited by the day-long pursuit of him swayed subconsciously by the insistent iteration on their brains of the sight of him fleeing away mastered by the feeling of mastery enjoyed all day the dogs could not bring themselves to give way to him
BTS You and Ernest will have to get married pretty quickly
BTS There is no other name for it
BTS and besides the sail lashed to the spare oars dragged in the sea ahead of us
BTS They were better housed better clothed better fed better treated
BTS As for you he went on turning toward Colonel Van Gilbert you have replied to nothing I have said
BTS You've got all you wanted out of me
BTS In this he was partially blocked but a dozen of the 'Frisco Reds were executed and the group was well-nigh destroyed
BTS I think and think and I cannot cease from thinking
BTS It will be great art I tell you and wonder cities will arise that will make tawdry and cheap the cities of old time
BTS Help me to a seat he said in the same hoarse frightened voice
BTS The words had barely left his mouth when he was knocked down by Leach
BTS and if you are so minded just go ahead and try to clap on the hatch
BTS But what shall we do
BTS A moment later Matt heard a footstep
BTS Maud clapped her hands gleefully
BTS That's not necessary
BTS From the little I learned I knew that Ernest had been keeping his promise of taking him through hell
BTS But the dead man was unconcerned
BTS As for the dozen men who were clamoring for the floor half of them began speaking at once
BTS This was a source of enjoyment to him
BTS Stronger than the physical restraint of the stick was the clutch of the camp upon her
BTS Ferry-boat
BTS I've 'ad the fever in Aspinwall in 'Avana in New Orleans
BTS And his cadences were their cadences the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness and the cold and dark
BTS Half the load and twice the dogs if they ever expected to reach Dawson was what was said
BTS The mind recoiled from contemplation of a world beyond this wet veil which wrapped us around
BTS A heavy seal-club in her hand caught my eyes and at that moment she followed my gaze down to it
BTS CHAPTER III THE GREY CUB He was different from his brothers and sisters
BTS They occupied nearly the whole circumference of his field of vision
BTS Mr
BTS Mebbe all mad dog sacredam
BTS Say Henry he chided gently ain't you forgot somethin'
BTS It was in a village at the Great Slave Lake that in the course of resenting the evil of the hands of the man-animals he came to modify the law that he had learned from Grey Beaver namely that the unpardonable crime was to bite one of the gods
BTS The moment White Fang appeared near them Lip-lip was upon him bullying and hectoring him or fighting with him until he had driven him away
BTS I roused at the first sound of his voice
BTS I failed to mark anything pre-eminently pretty about those foamy-mouthed beasts that raced me
BTS He knew only that they did threaten evil of some sort and that it was best for him to keep out of their reach
BTS The machine bothers my head
BTS I asked
BTS Men stared at him poked sticks between the bars to make him snarl and then laughed at him
BTS Ah I cannot get you to understand cannot drive it into your head what a thing this life is
BTS He kept a summer cottage in Mill Valley under the shadow of Mount Tamalpais and never occupied it except when he loafed through the winter months and read Nietzsche and Schopenhauer to rest his brain
BTS But won't they escape as Wainwright did
BTS At first he was dignified and the master laughed the harder
BTS Brutality had followed brutality and flaming passions and cold-blooded cruelty had driven men to seek one another's lives and to strive to hurt and maim and destroy
BTS In 1835 A
BTS At half-past five under his directions I set the table in the cabin with rough-weather trays in place and then carried the tea and cooked food down from the galley
BTS My chest and arms were bruised and aching in a score of places
BTS How are they going to get rid of them
BTS The fall elections were soon to occur and Ernest was nominated by the socialist party to run for Congress
BTS There he lay for the remainder of the weary night nursing his wrath and wounded pride
BTS I have forgotten to say that the bronze ended with his face
BTS In what could have been no less than an ecstasy I left my post at the head of the companion-way and started along the deck murmuring to myself those beautiful lines of Mrs
BTS Matthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow
BTS The worthless ones were to be got rid of and since dogs count for little against dollars they were to be sold
BTS My wrist was released but his other arm passed around my back held both my arms so that I could not move
BTS The holluschickie haul out by themselves and Dr
BTS They will become worshippers of beauty
BTS This was the cry from the Lady Mine
BTS We will be content with nothing less than all that you possess
BTS Another time when Ernest had just said that the metaphysical philosophers could never stand the test of truth Dr
BTS The she-wolf was trotting wearily along her mate well in advance when she came upon the overhanging high clay-bank
BTS My views are harsh
BTS Understand
BTS If it but knew the number of its own members who are our agents it would understand
BTS Here you One Ear
BTS I tried to cheer him up but he ignored my effort and suddenly began talking very hurriedly in a low voice as we passed through the station
BTS I only remember one part of the service he said and that is And the body shall be cast into the sea
BTS He came out with a piece of meat which he tossed to White Fang
BTS Scott grasped the dog-musher's hand
BTS But his answer was serious nay solemn
BTS Come now what is it worth
BTS There was a wild keen look in them I had never seen before and her lips parted and her breath suspended as the Ghost charging upon the wall of rock at the entrance to the inner cove swept into the wind and filled away into safe water
BTS and repeated a dream
BTS Something has happened to Weedon his wife said decisively
BTS The pound and a half of sun-dried salmon which was his ration for each day seemed to go nowhere
BTS This was my chance
BTS You are doomed to perish as all atavisms perish
BTS I queried
BTS Might be a lot of dog in 'm for all you can tell
BTS the quality that set apart his species from all other species
BTS How old are you
BTS He ripped them open or split their skulls with shrewdly driven blows of his great hoofs
BTS As for myself I was learning much from this contact with the working-class leaders and thinkers
BTS and the lips had answered Yes
BTS Removing the pillow and repeating the question he answered promptly that he did
BTS Never had he had such an appetite at our table in the old days
BTS Avis will stand by my side in what is to come
BTS Do you mean to tell me that Jackson had the right on his side and yet was beaten
BTS By the end of my second month in prison one of the jailers made himself known as a revolutionist in touch with the organization
BTS This was a god indeed a love-god a warm and radiant god in whose light White Fang's nature expanded as a flower expands under the sun
BTS The guard treated him unfairly lied about him to the warden lost his credits persecuted him
BTS The cut of her teeth in his neck still hurt but his feelings were hurt more grievously and he sat down and weakly whimpered
BTS He held the lamp close to them indicating them with his toe for his employer's benefit a steel dog-chain and a stout club
BTS Up he went clear up beyond the ratlines to the very masthead
BTS Day after day the boats lowered and were swallowed up almost ere they touched the water while we on board pumped the horn at regular intervals and every fifteen minutes fired the bomb gun
BTS Haskins
BTS Promptly came the reply that there was no record on the books of father's owning any stock and a polite request for more explicit information
BTS We were awake early and just finishing breakfast as daylight came
BTS It is a sad case
BTS The sweat was standing on my forehead and I could feel it trickling down my nose
BTS Henry it's a blame misfortune to be out of ammunition
BTS Once Buck went over and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up
BTS Undreamed of and unheralded it had come
BTS 'Tis no heart he has at all
BTS The whole regular army was in the field called there by the actions of the Black Hundreds
BTS He was lying motionless but moved slightly at the touch of my hand
BTS It was caused by remarks of Latimer's concerning the noises made by the mate in his sleep and though Johansen was whipped he kept the steerage awake for the rest of the night while he blissfully slumbered and fought the fight over and over again
BTS But now his waning powers would not permit such a course
BTS His excuse for being aboard was that he was drunk when he signed
BTS also there were official orders
BTS The driver was surprised too
BTS And take notice here that what is true of this particular industrial process is true of all industrial processes
BTS White-Fang even bristled up to him and walked stiff-legged but Lip-lip ignored the challenge
BTS The sun was returning
BTS The eyes and it was my destiny to know them well were large and handsome wide apart as the true artist's are wide sheltering under a heavy brow and arched over by thick black eyebrows
BTS Here is a man who wants to say get drunk
BTS You was sleepin' jes' too comfortable for anything Henry told him as he routed him out for breakfast
BTS The dogs sprang against the breast-bands strained hard for a few moments then relaxed
BTS A sentimentalist he sneered like Mr
BTS Judge them by their works
BTS Beauty Smith tightened the thong again and White Fang crawled limply and dizzily to his feet
BTS It is laughable the way this was accomplished
BTS The City of Tokio from 'Frisco bound for Yokohama
BTS But Dr
BTS Four times he had covered the distance between Salt Water and Dawson and the knowledge that jaded and tired he was facing the same trail once more made him bitter
BTS The sap was rising in the pines
BTS There was not a single instance of miscarriage
BTS Then came the suppression of his book
BTS I started to gasp out my information but he stopped me
BTS Anaesthesia as a mode of compulsory death was not introduced until later
BTS This is the fiat of evolution
BTS The whole middle class had not yet been exterminated
BTS As my fingers released hers she clutched for my arm hastily
BTS he merely lived the law without thinking about it at all
BTS He knew only hate and lost himself in the passion of it
BTS In it they will not let the ape and tiger die
BTS Henry suddenly demanded laying his hand on his partner's arm
BTS He had a method of accepting things without questioning the why and wherefore
BTS I was alone
BTS Yes Ernest answered precisely that
BTS But his strength ebbed his eyes glazed and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car
BTS By afternoon Perrault who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his despatches returned with two more dogs
BTS Sometimes as he crouched there blinking dreamily at the flames it seemed that the flames were of another fire and that as he crouched by this other fire he saw another and different man from the half-breed cook before him
BTS Blood and vengeance were in men's hearts
BTS Here was meat and life and it was guarded by no mysterious fires nor flying missiles of flame
BTS Calvin answered
BTS The wooded knolls are the same knolls referred to by Avis Everhard
BTS The other hunter Latimer a lean Yankee-looking fellow with shrewd narrow-slitted eyes held otherwise held that the seal pup was born on the land for no other reason than that it could not swim that its mother was compelled to teach it to swim as birds were compelled to teach their nestlings how to fly
BTS It was aglow with light as the sea itself and the eyes were flashing in the starshine
BTS I have called your class stupid when outside the realm of business
BTS Not so with the men
BTS The Oligarchy will encourage such ambition and the consequent competition
BTS The Church does not condone it the Bishop objected
BTS But he himself did not know anything about it
BTS He was too busy and happy to know that he was happy
BTS And with his arm chewed off
BTS He's my boat-puller
BTS He waved his hand to include all of them turned to his own comrades and said Listen to the bellowing of the well-fed beasts
BTS Furthermore the sled was of some service for it carried nearly two hundred pounds of outfit and food
BTS So I stood with hesitant knuckle without her door
BTS It was heresy
BTS Then their noses touched and he felt the warm little tongue of the puppy on his jowl
BTS The world was filled with surprise
BTS What do you think of him Hump
BTS At the forks he took the turning to the left where he found the lair of the lynx with whom his mother and he had fought long before
BTS Unlike other materialists I had met and with whom I had something in common to start on I had nothing in common with him
BTS It was dawn by three in the morning and twilight lingered till nine at night
BTS His throat worked spasmodically but made no sound while he struggled with all his body convulsed with the effort to rid himself of the incommunicable something that strained for utterance
BTS But Bill ignored him
BTS The hunters came trooping on deck with shot-guns and ammunition-boxes and most unusual their rifles
BTS I've got to live haven't I
BTS I demanded
BTS Trying to scuttle my ship for me
BTS Still he was not demonstrative
BTS But let that go Wolf Larsen continued
BTS The newspapers will purge his heresy in the oblivion of silence
BTS While the Grangers expired in flame and blood and organized labor was disrupted the socialists held their peace and perfected their secret organization
BTS You investigate Jackson's case
BTS In place of strikes will be slave revolts
BTS No thank you Latimer spoke up
BTS I shall go on with my book
BTS And on no day did they succeed in making more than half the distance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food computation
BTS She did not rush him now that her young one was safe
BTS Why did you ask
BTS CHAPTER III JACKSON'S ARM
BTS They were irregular shapes and sizes
BTS Under the whiskers and all unseen I knew that the skin was taking on a purplish hue
BTS He stepped up to the hatch-cover and all caps came off
BTS Had he contented himself with looking fierce and ominous all would have been well
BTS At such moments he even closed his eyes and allowed his body to be hurled hither and thither willy-nilly careless of any hurt that might thereby come to it
BTS And do not forget that these groups are working to-day practically in unison
BTS I always thought they were afraid of men I said
BTS CHAPTER VIII Sometimes I think Wolf Larsen mad or half-mad at least what of his strange moods and vagaries
BTS You might have suggested a window when the walls were going up I said
BTS Asmunsen replied
BTS The stream was a small one but in the pool it widened out to a score of feet
BTS But I wish to have you comfortable before I start
BTS He never ceased from his activities as a propagandist and was always scheduled long in advance for lectures to workingmen's organizations
BTS Oh it paid us
BTS I cannot say how greatly the man had come to interest me
BTS After the business that brought me there was transacted I was led away by one of them
BTS The day wore along and nothing rewarded his hunt
BTS It was a transparent face for all of its hairy shield and advertised instant relief when he glanced from Wolf Larsen to me noted that there was only the pair of us and then glanced over his own two men who had joined him
BTS The cries of Sedition
BTS We shall land on that island and we shall be snug and sheltered before the day is done
BTS Perrault found one with head buried in the grub-box
BTS The cub cowered closer to the ground
BTS Yet never did it ring more loudly than that night as I watched her draw back the blanket of moss from the coals blow up the fire and cook the evening meal
BTS It is inconceivable that any sane man can radically disagree with one's most sane conclusions
BTS He seemed torn by some mighty grief
BTS And where was he
BTS Thousands of secret agents were rushed to the devoted city
BTS He bristled suspiciously but the master warned him that all was well
BTS My bedroom at home was not large yet it could have contained a dozen similar forecastles and taking into consideration the height of the ceiling a score at least
BTS I felt over and under his blankets
BTS At such times Buck did not attempt to stay him but loped easily at his heels satisfied with the way the game was played lying down when the moose stood still attacking him fiercely when he strove to eat or drink
BTS Mash his brains out
BTS Sights and sounds and scents were familiar to him
BTS In order to discover the necessary area Nature had given him an enormous prognathous jaw
BTS Buck's senses came back to him but not his strength
BTS There is only so much water so much earth so much air
BTS Again I repeated the question
BTS I felt the mattress-like growth of beard on my neck knew that the sleeve of my coat was ripped that a button was missing from the throat of the blue shirt I wore
BTS We looked at each other expectantly
BTS Long I looked at her dwelling upon that one visible bit of her as only a man would who deemed it the most precious thing in the world
BTS give to the worker his product
BTS You have given shelter to an enemy of your class he said
BTS The boy metamorphosed into a savage on the instant
BTS And in the day that we sweep to victory at the ballot-box and you refuse to turn over to us the government we have constitutionally and peacefully captured and you demand what we are going to do about it--in that day I say we shall answer you
BTS And immortality
BTS In the shoulder he answered
BTS It was a neater job
BTS But the thought of the men in the midst of it steadied me and in my quest for them I forgot myself
BTS Everything was ready for the attempt
BTS the wounded drank
BTS for 'twas the other fellow Smoke sent up in the buckets to the top of the mine
BTS And in spite of the assuring voice the hand inspired distrust
BTS White Fang on the verge of retreat would have retreated leaving the meat to him
BTS White Fang burst into no furious outcry
BTS The patting movement slowly and carefully changed to a rubbing of the ears about their bases and the physical pleasure even increased a little
BTS Shut up your wishin' and your croakin' Henry burst out angrily
BTS And then there was that faint and unmistakable touch of awkwardness in his movements
BTS Each day he made it a point to caress and pet White Fang and to do it at length
BTS Go to it he said to White Fang
BTS you're mate just the same
BTS His mind seemed preoccupied and there were strange pauses in his conversation abrupt changes of topic and an inconsecutiveness that was bewildering
BTS These footprints were very fresh
BTS Look at dat Buck
BTS I sat down and pondered the problem
BTS Our food will not last but there are the seals
BTS The Iron Heel at first dubious about dealing with the entire proletariat at one time had found the work easier than it had expected and would have asked nothing better than an uprising on our part
BTS Somebody strike a light my thumb's out of joint said one of the men Parsons a swarthy saturnine man boat-steerer in Standish's boat in which Harrison was puller
BTS And still later it was noticed that a pleased light came into his eyes when he saw them approaching and that he looked after them with an appearance of curious regret when they left him for other amusements
BTS Turn 'm loose for a spell
BTS Labor buys back and consumes two billions
BTS A yawning hole was all that was to be seen
BTS The Twentieth Century left New York at six in the evening and was supposed to arrive at Chicago at seven next morning
BTS he shouted and though we four stood with our heads together that we might hear his voice seemed faint and far as though removed from us an immense distance
BTS Death Larsen makes you jump better than that and you know it
BTS As I lay there thinking I naturally dwelt upon myself and my situation
BTS Oh ask him  She hesitated
BTS No recipe of it has come down to us
BTS But Lucifer was a free spirit
BTS So great was his speed that as he curved past the corner of the cabin he slipped and fell
BTS And not I alone
BTS He clung on growling savagely
BTS He scraped furiously over a rock bruised across a second and struck a third with crushing force
BTS Because of a thousand capitalistic devices labor cannot buy back even half of the total product
BTS One or the other could not be
BTS He kept quiet no matter what injustice was perpetrated on him and really I think surprised his enemies
BTS CHAPTER V THE INDOMITABLE It's hopeless Weedon Scott confessed
BTS It's uncanny Pete said after it was over and they had caught their speech
BTS Wolf Larsen motioned for me to come down and when I stood beside him at the wheel gave me instructions for heaving to
BTS Jean Jacques Rousseau enunciated your socialistic theory nearly two centuries ago
BTS his intelligence shepherd intelligence and St
BTS But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog
BTS He looked at me in a slow and pondering way and shook his head
BTS In return it was argued by the prosecution that the weakness of the bomb was a blunder on the part of the socialists just as its premature explosion caused by Ernest's losing his nerve and dropping it was a blunder
BTS He kept the fire brightly blazing for he knew that it alone intervened between the flesh of his body and their hungry fangs
BTS Thus he learned how to inflict quick and severe damage
BTS And all of them are thralls by virtue of the fact that the trusts already own or control which is the same thing only better--own and control all the means of marketing the crops such as cold storage railroads elevators and steamship lines
BTS of fish diet and coarse living
BTS Please don't
BTS What are you waiting for
BTS All his weight was on one foot and he was in a state of unstable equilibrium
BTS A man ain't so quick after workin' steady for hours
BTS The she-wolf had by now developed a ferocious temper
BTS Dashing at top speed around a tepee he ran full tilt into Kiche lying at the end of her stick
BTS But we did not know it at the time
BTS Burning brands made them spring aside but they no longer sprang back
BTS But the trouble lay in that the wind was not strong enough nor steady enough to keep the sail full
BTS That is why he got to America
BTS For me you mean she said
BTS But there is a certain sense of equity that resides in life and it was this sense in him that resented the unfairness of his being permitted no defence against the stone-throwers
BTS You know damn well he wont
BTS My eyes fluttered and I could feel the blood warm in my face
BTS Everything shall be done here to keep the comrades quiet
BTS Got rid of her pilots and running into San Francisco
BTS Least of all things was I a mechanic and in that time I accomplished what an ordinary machinist would have done in as many hours
BTS I was born within a hundred miles of that stretch of water
BTS Man is so made these days that his capacity for living is determined by the money he possesses
BTS Wolf Larsen did not laugh though his grey eyes lighted with a slight glint of amusement
BTS So we headed for the great labor-ghetto on the South Side in the hope of getting in contact with some of the comrades
BTS Labor out of work had no wages with which to buy
BTS It is a ludicrous spectacle to us but we must not forget that we have seven centuries' advantage over those that lived in that time
BTS Often he took to the rim-ice that was beginning to form and more than once he crashed through and struggled for life in the icy current
BTS With four hundred miles of trail still between him and Dawson he could ill afford to have madness break out among his dogs
BTS Find out
BTS You would make the sun go backward in the sky
BTS The hair hung down limp and draggled or matted with dried blood where Hal's club had bruised him
BTS He betrayed his apprehension and started tentatively to go
BTS I caught him under the shoulders and dragged him to the companion-way
BTS It was written by an erring soul who yet saw clearly
BTS He faced the boy bristling and snarling his sense of justice outraged
BTS But we did not stir and we moved only when he moved
BTS All right he beamed good-naturedly and I'll tell you where to find him
BTS Garthwaite began uttering aloud the signals
BTS There was no defence for him
BTS Its jaws were pried apart to their greatest extension and a stout stake sharpened at both ends was so inserted that when the pries were removed the spread jaws were fixed upon it
BTS It was dry and cosey
BTS The oath left my lips in my excitement the first I do believe in my life unless trouble it an expletive of my youth be accounted an oath
BTS Oh
BTS Billee and Joe he called them two brothers and true huskies both
BTS and they uttered glib phrases that their own ears did not understand
BTS If you refused to go into the militia or to obey after you were in you would be tried by drumhead court martial and shot down like dogs
BTS These workers actually paid the increased wages of their stronger brothers who were members of unions that were labor monopolies
BTS This manoeuvre of getting under way I had studied and worked out a score of times
BTS The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his steps to the camp they had left
BTS for I want you a few thousand miles away from here
BTS The oligarchs had succeeded in devising a governmental machine as intricate as it was vast that worked--and this despite all our efforts to clog and hamper
BTS Then the muscles relaxed the head stopped rolling and a sigh as of profound relief floated upward from his lips
BTS he asked
BTS But before that as trial judge he had earned sentence of death by his fiendish malignancy
BTS Hello you husky
BTS Johnson I found lying full length on the forecastle head staring at the troubled churn of the forefoot and I remembered with horror the suggestion Wolf Larsen had made
BTS Grey Beaver was not there
BTS Go ahead Ernest encouraged
BTS Only I disagree with you about the doom of the middle class
BTS He was perpetually departing on yard-long adventures toward the cave's entrance and as perpetually being driven back
BTS Bull-pen--in a miners' strike in Idaho in the latter part of the nineteenth century it happened that many of the strikers were confined in a bull-pen by the troops
BTS In fact no ready-made suit of clothes ever could fit his body
BTS White Fang did not repeat his attack on the foot
BTS He did not know there was any outside at all
BTS And his carelessness might have been due to the familiarity of the trail to the pool
BTS Because he shaved himself with a razor that worked when it removed the hair from his face
BTS Well Spanker's troubles is over anyway
BTS And here in this inferno of luggage was White Fang deserted by the master
BTS Scott shook his head and went on trying to win White Fang's confidence
BTS She must have received warning of the coming of the Mercenaries for she had time safely to hide the Manuscript before she fled or was captured
BTS The Iron Heel has won
BTS His first glance was for Buck over whose limp and apparently lifeless body Nig was setting up a howl while Skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes
BTS I've had the feel iv it this long time and I can feel it now as plainly as I feel the rigging iv a dark night
BTS I cut no more than was necessary and what with passing the long ropes under and around the booms and masts of unreeving the halyards and sheets of coiling down in the boat and uncoiling in order to pass through another knot in the bight I was soon wet to the skin
BTS the other thundered with abrupt fierceness
BTS He had made Jackson answer damaging questions
BTS for life achieves its summit when it does to the uttermost that which it was equipped to do
BTS But it was not Kiche's fault
BTS I remembered Michelet and leaned my head against her
BTS Then it's jes' warm an' anxious I am to be hearin' you explain yourself he said
BTS The thong was cut across diagonally almost as clean as though done by a knife
BTS It was aimed against every workingman who was maimed in the mills
BTS But with the sheep-dog it was otherwise
BTS There was no telling when the god's ulterior motive might be disclosed
BTS They gathered together in bands in order to go to work or to return from work
BTS It has never been my weakness to exalt the flesh far from it
BTS Three men with clubs were helping him to scatter them
BTS You forget I replied
BTS But the man never turned and after stretching his arms above his head and yawning audibly he retraced his steps to the forecastle scuttle and disappeared
BTS But can you wonder that we lose patience with you
BTS Soldiers and slaves lay together torn and mangled around and over the wreckage of the automobiles and guns
BTS Both men located the sound
BTS He had a wife and three children
BTS And on the part of White Fang it required nothing less than a revolution
BTS I saw the surprise that came over her
BTS It manifested itself to him as a void in his being a hungry aching yearning void that clamoured to be filled
BTS and God forgive me I am not man enough to be his executioner
BTS the sled had not moved
BTS And here under his direct supervision for he went ashore himself Leach and Johnson filled the small casks and rolled them down to the beach
BTS Wearied from the night of struggle and wreck all hands were yet asleep I thought
BTS At such moments when his dogs snarled the whole circle would be agitated the wolves coming to their feet and pressing tentatively forward a chorus of snarls and eager yelps rising about him
BTS The great breast and heavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of the body where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin
BTS But coal
BTS Now's your chance Hump he said
BTS The next instant they were opposite the poop where stood Wolf Larsen and I
BTS With the German Emperor out of the way Germany would have no surplus to sell abroad
BTS I asked
BTS The faro-dealer grunted
BTS I could not collect my thoughts
BTS It is unfortunate we haven't plenty of ammunition but I think anyway that they suffer less from being clubbed than from being all shot up
BTS Van Weyden Wolf Larsen said as I came on the poop
BTS As she had saved Dick's life she now saved the groom's
BTS Perhaps they sensed his wild-wood breed and instinctively felt for him the enmity that the domestic dog feels for the wolf
BTS All such attempts ended in failure
BTS There is no validity to your conclusions
BTS And oh
BTS Henry
BTS But Buck was in open revolt
BTS Mugridge's brutality to me was paid back in kind and with interest
BTS Not only were we hungry but we were now suffering from thirst
BTS He sat down
BTS He worked as a night watchman hawked potatoes on the street pasted labels in a cannery warehouse was utility man in a paper-box factory and water-carrier for a street railway construction gang and even joined the Dishwashers' Union just before it fell to pieces
BTS As before it followed him back to earth
BTS she asked
BTS I seen some of them
BTS That's why I kept my hands offen him at the start
BTS You have eternal life before you
BTS You are not frightened
BTS Then it descended pandemonium broke loose everything happened at once
BTS Only the inner chiefs could have known up to to-day
BTS Boarded me in the night with only the watch on deck
BTS At that time polygamy was still practised in Turkey
BTS I cried
BTS To complete his description his teeth were large and yellow while the two eye-teeth larger than their fellows showed under his lean lips like fangs
BTS It would have required an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright and Hal was not such a man
BTS and also I thought We were so happy and peaceful before he came
BTS When I thought I had it I cried to her to slack away
BTS The unseen ferry-boat was blowing blast after blast and the mouth-blown horn was tooting in terror-stricken fashion
BTS He is without conscience
BTS to see him in all his certitude and strength shattering their complacency shaking them out of their ruts of thinking
BTS His rage was a madness
BTS I was trembling all over and I could feel the shivers running up and down my spine and the sweat standing out on my forehead
BTS She was looking worried and apprehensive
BTS His talk was very true and good and I have never forgotten
BTS Thus when he had bumped his nose on the back-wall a few times he accepted that he would not disappear into walls
BTS He gave a great start of fright
BTS And another I know what I'll say that I heered a row jumped out of my bunk got a jolly good crack on the jaw for my pains and sailed in myself
BTS The pale light of the short sunless day was beginning to fade when a faint far cry arose on the still air
BTS They still insisted that victory could be gained through the elections
BTS The Plutocracy by virtue of its possession of the government raised their taxes
BTS Some sailor he told me had laid hold of it by his teeth at the beginning of the fight and hung on and been dragged to the top of the forecastle ladder when he was kicked loose
BTS And you saw what a general strike would do Ernest went on
BTS Might is right and that is all there is to it
BTS There were scientific works too among which were represented men such as Tyndall Proctor and Darwin
BTS Jes' because he couldn't chew himself loose he chews Spanker loose
BTS Collie snarled warningly at him and he was careful to keep his distance
BTS Head right into the bunch Mr
BTS Judge Scott shook his head sadly at luncheon table when his son narrated the lesson he had given White Fang
BTS Yes he answered in a low strong voice and worse than that
BTS I took him through the slums of San Francisco and in drunkenness prostitution and criminality he learned a deeper cause than innate depravity
BTS Pike the malingerer leaped upon the crippled animal breaking its neck with a quick flash of teeth and a jerk Buck got a frothing adversary by the throat and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular
BTS There were no takers
BTS And Maud Brewster
BTS As we came to the corner we saw the howling mob bearing down upon us
BTS Each time he performed the journey with greater swagger but he never brought more than a few dollars at a time
BTS They threw clubs at him
BTS Again and this time with purpose did Grey Beaver kick him
BTS By the second night Maud was falling asleep from exhaustion
BTS You leave Oofty alone
BTS Two other balloons followed at the same time
BTS It was too good too good to be true
BTS We had each other for eighteen precious months and we were not lonely for there was always a coming and going of leaders and comrades--strange voices from the under-world of intrigue and revolution bringing stranger tales of strife and war from all our battle-line
BTS Only a set-back a delay
BTS Why I was living them
BTS Parsons called back
BTS Johnson's ascent was arrested
BTS This is not braggadocio on the part of Avis Everhard
BTS But even his tremendous will could not overcome the dissolution that assailed it
BTS And so nicely had he made his calculation we drifted fairly down upon it so that nothing remained to do but hook the tackles to either end and hoist it aboard
BTS I'll wager the Oligarchy finds justification Ernest said when its treachery to the German Emperor became known
BTS They were ready to lend aid to the revolution
BTS but death the ceasing to be able to be vain and vexed he found an eviler thing
BTS I am smiling
BTS Prisoners and captors hiccoughed on one another's shoulders and swore mighty oaths of respect and esteem
BTS And I stated that from these two facts no other conclusion was possible than that the capitalist class had mismanaged
BTS he cried
BTS I am just learning for myself
BTS He was plainly expectant of a rebuff and he was just as plainly surprised when her teeth did not flash out at him in anger
BTS You would be drafted into the militia
BTS Besides not only had he abandoned the Wild and his kind when he gave himself up to man but the terms of the covenant were such that if ever he met Kiche again he would not desert his god to go with her
BTS As the Pococks defied the executioners of the Fighting Groups so she defied the executioners of the Iron Heel
BTS If you continue to stand with us we'll put an end to the reign of capitalism
BTS Then when Biedenbach and the other comrades awoke with their aid I concocted a little conspiracy
BTS I quavered
BTS Then and quite suddenly he became aware of loneliness
BTS But on the near bank shortly before dark a moose coming down to drink had been espied by Kloo-kooch who was Grey Beaver's squaw
BTS Not I he laughed back
BTS One is driving a delivery wagon for us
BTS Observing the same principle of widest distribution of weight the dogs at the ends of their ropes radiated fan-fashion from the nose of the sled so that no dog trod in another's footsteps
BTS So this will be the last night we have to stand watch and because of that it will go the easier
BTS You will descend to us
BTS At a calculation of a two-mile drift per hour during the seventy and odd hours of the storm we had been driven at least one hundred and fifty miles to the north-east
BTS Shockin'
BTS He knew clearly what was to be done and this he did by promptly eating the ptarmigan
BTS Why what can be worse than cutting our throats
BTS The man was a beast
BTS For such destruction of property innocent men were frequently punished--railroaded in the parlance of the times
BTS But he offered me even better than that--offered to make me president of some great college of physical sciences that is being planned--the Oligarchy must get rid of its surplus somehow you see
BTS Now if you did not have to get so close to the subject  The very thing
BTS The old familiar feelings of that time came back upon him surged up within him
BTS Judge Scott still held to the same opinion and proved it to everybody's dissatisfaction by measurements and descriptions taken from the encyclopaedia and various works on natural history
BTS Tell him the deck flopped up and gouged yer teeth out iv yer jaw Louis grinned
BTS He might have waited and destroyed our work more effectually when we had more accomplished
BTS W
BTS Teek followed
BTS One hand extended outward and began to descend upon his head
BTS A full stomach conduces to inaction and the cub lay in the cave sleeping against his mother's side
BTS Forgive me for my rudeness
BTS We'll see about that asserted the Judge as he started for the telephone
BTS My
BTS Not only did they not know how to work dogs but they did not know how to work themselves
BTS Whenever he ventured away from his mother the bully was sure to appear trailing at his heels snarling at him picking upon him and watchful of an opportunity when no man-animal was near to spring upon him and force a fight
BTS And then blind and reeling he followed at Beauty Smith's heels back to the fort
BTS he carried the Judge's grandsons on his back or rolled them in the grass and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard and even beyond where the paddocks were and the berry patches
BTS Besides it was not the life of the herd or of the young bulls that was threatened
BTS I had thought they were to live in
BTS When it comes to a knowledge of the law of how best to evade the law or make new law for the benefit of thieving corporations I am down in the dirt at your feet
BTS But Wolf Larsen regained control of himself by an exertion of his remarkable will
BTS The next instant the latter kicked me violently as a cur is kicked
BTS Common shell and shrapnel were thrown in upon them from a distance and when in their desperation they charged the encircling lines they were mowed down by the machine-guns
BTS The dust-demon was the lord of the household
BTS It was misunderstood for fear and such misunderstandings made for death
BTS He who fairly burnt with immortality denied himself immortality--such was the paradox of him
BTS Bishop Morehouse arose and abruptly began  It took but a few minutes to cross by ferry from Berkeley to San Francisco
BTS The cows lumbered out of my way and the distance between me and the bull decreased
BTS I crouched and listened
BTS Mine is the role of the weak
BTS They got out of the way gave trail to the grown dogs and gave up meat to them under compulsion
BTS Eighteen hundred he calculated
BTS The crowd fell silent
BTS They half circled about each other tentatively snarling and bristling
BTS And at this point Bishop Dickinson arose and with an expression of disgust on his face fled from the platform and the hall
BTS The door-knob rattled
BTS And now Mr
BTS The horrid picture of anarchy was held always before their child's eyes until they in turn obsessed by this cultivated fear held the picture of anarchy before the eyes of the children that followed them
BTS White Fang sniffed the puppy curiously whereupon Kiche rushed upon him gashing his face a second time
BTS I must say I don't understand your technicalities she said but I do your conclusion and I don't like it
BTS And sometimes the young leader on the left whirled too
BTS he demanded abruptly turning back to me
BTS and innumerable interstices in the walls not so tightly stuffed with moss as Maud had supposed disclosed themselves
BTS Like a flash Buck struck breaking the neck
BTS And this is the first time I have ever heard the word pronounced
BTS There must be a station somewhere and men
BTS A thousand dollars if you take me ashore
BTS In short Beauty Smith was a monstrosity and the blame of it lay elsewhere
BTS I've whispered never a word
BTS Our biology teaches the absurdity of it
BTS The Oligarchy wanted the war with Germany
BTS And how good it was
BTS Good
BTS And it was for the same reason that Canada was lost to the mother country
BTS As it was with Buck so was it with his mates
BTS When every country stands with an unconsumed and unsalable surplus on its hands the capitalist system will break down under the terrific structure of profits that it itself has reared
BTS The latter were rarely taken in the boats for a seal shot at long range with a rifle invariably sank before a boat could reach it
BTS labor succeeded in getting a law passed in Pennsylvania providing that proof of the age of the child and of certain educational qualifications must accompany the oath of the parent
BTS The sailors slipped forward setting the side-lights as they went while the two hunters remained to sleep in the cabin it not being deemed advisable to open the slide to the steerage companion-way
BTS And it wanted the war for a dozen reasons
BTS But it would be cowardly was the protest
BTS She was pretty and soft and had been chivalrously treated all her days
BTS Wolf Larsen strode aft from amidships where he had been talking with the rescued men
BTS Again that worthy grunted
BTS I think he only half lived after all
BTS But you never read our papers
BTS I stuck it in like into soft butter an' the w'y 'e squealed was better'n a tu-penny gaff
BTS Besides this food he went on
BTS He would have to learn the reality of a thing before he could put his faith into it
BTS I feared nothing
BTS The eyes were large and brown and lustrous the mouth sweet and sensitive and the face itself a delicate oval though sun and exposure to briny wind had burnt the face scarlet
BTS Now I who am only a sailor would look upon the situation somewhat differently
BTS The mere utterance of it could damn any scheme no matter how sanely conceived of economic amelioration or regeneration
BTS Down out of the blue it would rush as it dropped upon him changing itself into the ubiquitous electric car
BTS I do I made answer
BTS Thomas Mugridge is cur-like in his subjection to me while I go about in secret dread of him
BTS Frog's gone came the answer
BTS No man less than a giant could have done what he did once he had gained the foot of the ladder
BTS nor did the boldest of them ever dare to rob him of his meat
BTS So unexpected was it and so shrewdly managed that Spitz was hurled backward and off his feet
BTS Gentlemen I have merely sketched the power of one of the seven groups that constitute the brain of the Plutocracy
BTS The fog seemed to break away as though split by a wedge and the bow of a steamboat emerged trailing fog-wreaths on either side like seaweed on the snout of Leviathan
BTS I was puzzled
BTS The look in her eyes became far away
BTS Go below and fill a sack with coal
BTS I looked at Maud
BTS She was appalled by what she had done in bringing this firebrand before her blessed Philomath Club
BTS Hill with his control of the Northwest
BTS Without them anarchy would reign and humanity would drop backward into the primitive night out of which it had so painfully emerged
BTS for as it is with the hunters so it is with the boat-pullers and steerers in the place of wages they receive a lay a rate of so much per skin for every skin captured in their particular boat
BTS The last lines are going down
BTS and he was bruised and sore in all his small body when he was again flung down in the canoe
BTS A temporary pause when taken off his guard gave him the vital moment in which to think and determine his action
BTS I broke short off in the middle of a sentence
BTS Have you tried to get word to Chicago
BTS We had a gambler's chance in the street but in here there is no chance at all
BTS The newcomer turned upon the crowd
BTS It was inevitable that much of the mire and slime should cling and be not easily shaken off
BTS I shrank from his hand
BTS For a time White Fang growled in unison with him a correspondence of rhythm being established between growl and voice
BTS God
BTS And there were many similar men owners or part-owners in small factories small businesses and small industries--small capitalists in short
BTS I am a sick man a very sick man he repeated again and yet once again
BTS I never had so much reason for living was my concluding thought
BTS Blood dripped from every finger-end while the nails were broken to the quick
BTS Battle royal raged and the ministers grew red-faced and excited especially at the moments when Ernest called them romantic philosophers shadow-projectors and similar things
BTS But the clamour of approval did not distract him
BTS but White Fang always disappointed them
BTS Also the farms and warehouses were the property of the Iron Heel
BTS They were describing the earth as the centre of the universe while the scientists were discovering America and probing space for the stars and the laws of the stars
BTS stuttered a member of the latest dynasty a king of the Skookum Benches
BTS Half of them I am sure were anxious to see us shedding each other's blood
BTS And now a large part of the American people must begin to enrich the Rockefellers as soon as the sun goes down no matter what form of illuminant they use
BTS he exclaimed the next moment
BTS Packed with the pulse of an unborn race Torn with a world's desire The surging flood of my wild young blood Would quench the judgment fire
BTS It was only by long practice that such results could be obtained
BTS He rested for two days and then ventured forth from the cave again
BTS I had no proper basis
BTS The sound of it was metallic
BTS Which is a cheap thing and without value
BTS Wolf Larsen and I between us cut off Kerfoot's crushed finger and sewed up the stump
BTS He insisted that I succeeded in cutting his work in half
BTS Who
BTS White Fang was bitter and implacable
BTS They had no chance against us
BTS Nor did I call this time from the top of the companion-way
BTS In a second the whole team was in full cry
BTS He is said to have remarked when he put them in that he preferred turning her over to losing the sticks
BTS If I am immortal why
BTS Once the terror of this giddy sweep overpowered me and for a while I clung on hand and foot weak and trembling unable to search the sea for the missing boats or to behold aught of the sea but that which roared beneath and strove to overwhelm the Ghost
BTS No he answered I ain't for callin' it that
BTS At one time in my life he continued after another pause I dreamed that I might some day talk with men who used such language that I might lift myself out of the place in life in which I had been born and hold conversation and mingle with men who talked about just such things as ethics
BTS Instead and after a wistful searching look he snuggled in burrowing his head out of sight between the master's arm and body
BTS And White Fang licked his hurts and meditated upon this his first taste of pack-cruelty and his introduction to the pack
BTS It won't happen again
BTS Perrault scaled it by a miracle while Francois prayed for just that miracle
BTS Once at the tree he studied the surrounding forest in order to fell the tree in the direction of the most firewood
BTS But in the confusion I managed to crawl into an empty lower bunk out of the way
BTS That'll do
BTS On his back he carried half a sack of coal with kindling on top
BTS But he did not go into the fires
BTS No man in the industrial machine is a free-will agent except the large capitalist and he isn't if you'll pardon the Irishism
BTS The Bishop bowed and gave me precedence
BTS I tich heem queek as anyt'ing
BTS As he had howled in his puppy days when he fled back from the Wild to the village to find it vanished and naught but a rubbish-heap to mark the site of Grey Beaver's tepee so now he pointed his muzzle to the cold stars and told to them his woe
BTS Upon that he was resolved
BTS Nothing happened
BTS Good-night Mr
BTS And your branch store absorbed the profits of the three small ones
BTS Whatever it was I knew that it was climbing aboard by the log-line
BTS By the light of the lantern I saw the butt twist slowly around till its sides coincided with the sides of the step
BTS And on still another day two dogs were set against him at the same time
BTS and when they come between me and life I out-grip them out-tear them out-destroy them
BTS You are too much of a man for ship discipline if that is what you mean and if you know what I mean was Wolf Larsen's retort
BTS As you love me Buck
BTS he always dressed for dinner or supper rather
BTS Leach had evidently done his task with a thoroughness that Mugridge had not forgiven for words followed and evil names involving smirched ancestries
BTS I guess I'll sit down and take the sunshine I heard Wolf Larsen saying
BTS When I had last seen him he had looked a sick man
BTS I was quite taken aback and before I could find myself had sillily stammered I I am a gentleman
BTS Life itself was meat
BTS In my excitement I had not been taking notice of other things and I looked up to see the lord of the harem charging down upon me
BTS She no more than started for she swayed and tottered and reached her hand weakly out to mine
BTS I knew nothing saw nothing merely tottered on in my quest for safety
BTS CHAPTER XII THE BISHOP It was after my marriage that I chanced upon Bishop Morehouse
BTS But he could well stand it for it seemed to add a certain nobility of refinement to the riotous excess of life that had always marked his features
BTS You led me from theories about life to life itself
BTS And we must keep smiling faces and be friendly with him no matter how repulsive it may be
BTS True Wolf Larsen possessed intellect to an unusual degree but it was directed solely to the exercise of his savage instincts and made him but the more formidable a savage
BTS In neither his father nor his mother was there any weakness nor in the generations before them
BTS There was no need for this caution
BTS This accomplished he had little trouble with them
BTS Still no one answered
BTS This act of pointing put White Fang on his guard and when they tried to approach him he showed his teeth and backed away
BTS All about me were nobleness of purpose and heroism of effort and my days and nights were sunshine and starshine all fire and dew with before my eyes ever burning and blazing the Holy Grail Christ's own Grail the warm human long-suffering and maltreated but to be rescued and saved at the last
BTS Well done
BTS Avis Everhard would have had to live for many generations ere she could have seen the clearing up of this particular mystery
BTS From the deck to the truck of the maintopmast is something over a hundred feet while the foremast with its topmast is eight or ten feet shorter
BTS It was not born of any knowledge of his yet it was the visible expression of the fear that was in him and for which in his own life there was no accounting
BTS He had fought more fights knew how to meet more tricks and methods and had more tricks himself while his own method was scarcely to be improved upon
BTS And even after fatigue came his heritage of endurance braced him to endless endeavour and enabled him to drive his complaining body onward
BTS Besides there was no false sentiment about her feeling
BTS Sleep was welling up and gripping him again his head was sinking down upon his knees when he roused with a sudden start
BTS He had to ignore the urges and promptings of instinct and reason defy experience give the lie to life itself
BTS I had heard it before during the sinking of the Martinez
BTS He put his arms around me and kissed me and took it for granted that we should be married
BTS No she didn't eat him
BTS he shouted in my face flinging off the hand
BTS Lie down sir
BTS Pike crippled and limping only half conscious and not conscious enough longer to malinger
BTS But the other animals the squirrels and quail and cottontails were creatures of the Wild who had never yielded allegiance to man
BTS There was the home-made galley we had built the familiar break of the poop the low yacht-cabin scarcely rising above the rail
BTS Before long we won't know where we are by five hundred miles
BTS The men in the fort disdained the newcomers and enjoyed seeing them come to grief
BTS He remembered her vaguely but he remembered her and that was more than could be said for her
BTS Yet his dominant nature asserted itself and he had first to thrash them into an acknowledgment of his superiority and leadership
BTS As the hunting man-animals went out and came back so she would come back to the village some time
BTS He smelled it and found it so recent that he crouched swiftly and looked in the direction in which it disappeared
BTS I crept through the store to the front
BTS I queried
BTS I learned also that Wolf Larsen was anxious to make the most of the storm which was driving him to the south-west into that portion of the sea where he expected to pick up with the north-east trades
BTS Those behind urged on and the column from gutter to gutter telescoped upon itself
BTS And in that day there won't be any destruction of the machines
BTS For the thick of the fleet had been to the westward of us and the boats scattered far and wide had headed in mad flight for the nearest refuge
BTS Had they not met accidentally there would not have been any warning
BTS and at the expense of several rows threats and much grumbling he brought the hunters to time
BTS Casting off the shore-lines I kedged her out by main strength the windlass being broken till she rode nearly up and down to the small anchor too small to hold her in any breeze
BTS After the rent it's not so bad
BTS This was the danger point the stretching of the conspiracy
BTS Hand-clapping and roars of laughter from the hunters greeted the exploit while Mugridge eluding half of his pursuers at the foremast ran aft and through the remainder like a runner on the football field
BTS Yes she answered that is what they pay
BTS For days at a time we could never see the sun nor take an observation
BTS But the wolves were growing bolder and the men were aroused more than once from their sleep
BTS I can see her now as I write these lines a leap in advance her gray hair flying in thin tangled strings the blood dripping down her forehead from some wound in the scalp in her right hand a hatchet her left hand lean and wrinkled a yellow talon gripping the air convulsively
BTS An' I wisht 'twas three hundred
BTS He stood staring after her for a minute then returned to himself and to me
BTS He travelled very clumsily
BTS And there were the dogs ever squabbling and bickering bursting into uproars and creating confusions
BTS Denied the expression of power amongst his own kind he fell back upon the lesser creatures and there vindicated the life that was in him
BTS There was no wind the tide was high and the schooner floated
BTS I never before knew the meaning of the word
BTS The jaws stopped working the ears ceased wobbling and though eyes remained glued on plates each man listened greedily for the answer
BTS They were only hot-air balloons clumsily and hastily made but they did the work
BTS The expropriation of the farmers that took place at this time would also have swelled our vote had it not been for the brief and futile rise of the Grange Party
BTS I can't believe it I cried
BTS You'd hardly expect them to avoid Wolf Larsen without my feet inside of them
BTS and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy by the saw-mill at Dawson they understood Buck and his ways and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with Skeet and Nig
BTS Between gulps of the molten stuff I glanced down at my raw and bleeding chest and turned to the Scandinavian
BTS and behind the will to enforce it was the whip of cariboo-gut with its biting thirty-foot lash
BTS Possibly Beauty Smith arch-fiend and tormentor was capable of breaking White Fang's spirit but as yet there were no signs of his succeeding
BTS With their fists alone they had no chance whatever
BTS She was tied but he could not get away from her easily
BTS He had too great strength
BTS Then he began rolling down the slope over and over
BTS I'm Garthwaite
BTS On the instant a score of the famished brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon
BTS Mercedes nursed a special grievance the grievance of sex
BTS And then woe the dog that had not yet finished
BTS She was too unused as yet to the whims of the man to accept them with equanimity
BTS I shouted holding the fingers and waiting for the single pressure which would signify Yes
BTS A favourite trick of his was to lose his trail in running water and then lie quietly in a near-by thicket while their baffled cries arose around him
BTS But don't you
BTS In quick rage he sprang at the man who met him halfway grappled him close by the throat and with a deft twist threw him over on his back
BTS I struck a match and looked at my watch
BTS Her three suitors all bore the marks of her teeth
BTS He had driven the machine out there with despatches on the afternoon of the third day
BTS They did cut up more'n usual Henry acknowledged
BTS Dawn came and daylight
BTS Class hatred is neither in the text nor in the spirit of anything I have ever written
BTS To such extremity were the gods driven that they ate the soft-tanned leather of their mocassins and mittens while the dogs ate the harnesses off their backs and the very whip-lashes
BTS He paused at the mouth of the cave with a sudden shock of suspicion
BTS I'll beat you out though brother mine he chuckled
BTS the boom-boom of guns and the pitiful slaughter through the long day
BTS They builded gods in their own shapes and out of their own desires while the scientists were building roads and bridges
BTS He was the perfect scientist
BTS The swelling had not gone down and the cap was still up on edge
BTS In fact in his boyhood before he had been named Beauty by his fellows he had been called Pinhead
BTS But this was not to the fancy of the Iron Heel
BTS He observed the boy lay down the axe and take up a stout club
BTS I had never seen fear so strongly stamped upon a human face
BTS Furthermore the revolutionary parties in all countries gave public utterance to the socialist principle of international peace that must be preserved at all hazards even to the extent of revolt and revolution at home
BTS He used to tell with great glee how they were wont to shake their heads mournfully at the price to accomplish ponderously a bit of mental arithmetic and then to say But you can't make six per cent on it
BTS That's Horner's and Smoke's work
BTS If you're afraid to tell me your way out I'll tell it to you
BTS I guess you can come an' get me any time he mumbled
BTS Then I had no right to kick 'm
BTS Whining with eagerness he followed back from the river bank and in among the trees
BTS You lacked perspective
BTS The water-breakers and grub-boxes from all the other boats were likewise missing as were the beds and sea bags of the two men
BTS As you know we're short a mate
BTS Kind of strange colour for a wolf was Bill's criticism
BTS Had he been full-grown he would have run away
BTS Then you must work later--till after midnight sometimes
BTS It is the word of God
BTS Still the punishment delayed
BTS and they were alert and vigilant the pair of them ears twitching and moving and nostrils quivering for the man heard and smelled as keenly as Buck
BTS Well
BTS I pondered it long lying sleepless in my bunk and reviewing in endless procession the facts of the situation
BTS Chicago was the devoted city selected for the instruction and well were we instructed
BTS It took me no little while to puzzle it out but I finally discovered that it was because I was more luckily born than he gentleman born he put it
BTS The seals had started on their great southern migration and the rookery was practically deserted
BTS Over and done with
BTS They cannot dispose of these surpluses to one another
BTS What he foresaw was the defection of the great labor unions and the rise of the castes
BTS This is news to me was the answer
BTS In 1906 A
BTS Not guilty he answered
BTS While she accepted him because it was the mandate of the gods that was no reason that she should leave him in peace
BTS he asked almost in a whisper
BTS But he was dead now nor did the ranch descend to his children
BTS But the bane of his life was Lip-lip
BTS And it's you that asks me
BTS she quavered
BTS The young slip of a gale having wetted our gills proceeded to moderate
BTS All the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his beautiful furry coat
BTS Until his hearing goes we shall be able to communicate with him
BTS We could follow these tragedies only by the sound
BTS A miners' meeting called on the spot decided that the dog had sufficient provocation and Buck was discharged
BTS All things were thawing bending snapping
BTS At the end of two hours Thomas Mugridge put away knife and stone and held out his hand
BTS Nor did the cub move
BTS but it is definitely settled now that the ghetto was fired by the Mercenaries under orders from their chiefs
BTS Cast it off I answered slipping a turn of the rope
BTS With the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead or the stars leaping in the frost dance and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life only it was pitched in minor key with long-drawn wailings and half-sobs and was more the pleading of life the articulate travail of existence
BTS But this circle had a continuous tendency to draw in upon him
BTS He could eat anything no matter how loathsome or indigestible
BTS Francois guiding the sled at the gee-pole sometimes exchanged places with him but not often
BTS We discovered that we were pawns
BTS As it was it seemed inconceivable that I could bear the weight I did and live
BTS He wanted it because it was his nature because he had been gripped tight by that nameless incomprehensible pride of the trail and trace that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp which lures them to die joyfully in the harness and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness
BTS All the hours of his short life he had depended upon her
BTS He had not been made for the close confinement wild beasts endure at the hands of men
BTS I remembered Ernest's women of Chicago who toiled for ninety cents a week and the child slaves of the Southern cotton mills he had described
BTS he went on at once with his perpetual queries
BTS God knows I don't want to kill him or have him killed Scott answered putting away the revolver
BTS He was no longer afraid of minor things and much of his timidity had vanished though the unknown never ceased to press upon him with its mysteries and terrors intangible and ever-menacing
BTS And then abruptly the newspapers and the critical magazines ceased saying anything about the book at all
BTS Like the savage the attitude of these men was stoical in great things childish in little things
BTS As it was hour after hour day after day in endless train-loads by hundreds of thousands the Mercenaries were hurled into Chicago
BTS Yes he is I said sliding out of the bunk and striving my hardest to keep my voice steady and bold
BTS Grey Beaver never petted nor caressed
BTS With the exception of the terrible details Jackson's story of his accident was the same as that I had already heard
BTS His forgotten cubhood all that was associated with that familiar snarl rushed back to him
BTS he was repeating over and over in a whisper
BTS There was no roar and rumble of traffic
BTS As for this return to nature that you say you learned at college before I was born permit me to point out that on the face of it you cannot have learned anything since
BTS Here are a few of his phrases I caught 'Our original principles are all right' 'What this country requires is a return to fundamental American methods--free opportunity for all' 'The spirit of liberty in which this nation was born' 'Let us return to the principles of our forefathers
BTS There was no place to which to flee
BTS You know you I agreed that the cooking should be mine and  But just this once I pleaded
BTS As soon as she put it on a flattering personal basis generosity compelled me to deny her
BTS In my ears are the cries of the stricken
BTS He made no reply at first but on my repeating the question he answered No no
BTS It bid fair to destroy for me all that was best and brightest in life
BTS He did not run long
BTS Watch me
BTS There was no telling
BTS He never ran to meet his god
BTS He had got for himself a hoof and part of the shin-bone to which quite a bit of meat was attached
BTS He had learned some more about the world
BTS Thus was I bluntly dismissed from the poop only to find Mugridge sleeping soundly from the morphine I had given him
BTS I was wont to deny that heredity and environment could explain his own originality and genius any more than could the cold groping finger of science catch and analyze and classify that elusive essence that lurked in the constitution of life itself
BTS He compromised
BTS By sheer compulsion of personality he commanded silence
BTS And if I and a few others should lead a million and a half of men into the houses of all the well-to-do there would be a great deal of shooting wouldn't there
BTS But then you see that's all part of the day's work he wound up boyishly
BTS CHAPTER XXIV NIGHTMARE I had not closed my eyes the night before on the Twentieth Century and what of that and of my exhaustion I slept soundly
BTS All is vanity and vexation of spirit' There is no profit under the sun' There is one event unto all' to the fool and the wise the clean and the unclean the sinner and the saint and that event is death and an evil thing he says
BTS You are a pauper
BTS He had travelled a greater distance than the other dogs in the yielding of himself to the rule of the gods and he had learned more thoroughly the futility of opposing their will
BTS but in its wistfulness there was none of the dog affection
BTS Sierra Vista awoke in alarm
BTS I sprang jubilantly to my feet
BTS It took its rise out of the tittle-tattle and tale-bearing which had been the cause of Johnson's beating and from the noise we heard and from the sight of the bruised men next day it was patent that half the forecastle had soundly drubbed the other half
BTS And I make free to say as the days went by that I found I was taking a certain secret pride in myself
BTS What honest man who is not insane would take lost women and thieves into his house to dwell with him sisterly and brotherly
BTS It's beyond me Matt Scott answered with a mournful shake of the head
BTS Inside the Mercenaries were thousands of our comrades
BTS There is nothing clear and sharp and definite about the thought you have expressed
BTS What would death be like
BTS So dazed was I for the moment that I was scarcely aware of the fact that we were being held up by the police
BTS Besides Kiche was well-nigh forgotten
BTS The result was that he was slowly throttling White Fang
BTS So spoke Matt coming out of the cabin his sleeves rolled up a pan of dirty dish-water in his hands arrested in the act of emptying the pan by the sight of Weedon Scott patting White Fang
BTS It was only a year
BTS So insistent was my gaze that at last she stirred under the blankets the top fold was thrown back and she smiled out on me her eyes yet heavy with sleep
BTS Every hour every minute of my existence was in jeopardy
BTS CHAPTER X THE VORTEX Following like thunder claps upon the Business Men's dinner occurred event after event of terrifying moment
BTS He didn't but he will an' he'll break that squarehead's heart or it's little I know iv the ways iv men on the ships iv the sea
BTS Who values it
BTS Judge Scott nodded his head in agreement
BTS and yet through it all was order purpose control
BTS And you permitted it
BTS Two hours' sewing on each pair
BTS My arms were about him and his head was on my breast
BTS He was in a savage temper and standing over six feet from the ground was as formidable an antagonist as even Buck could desire
BTS We had no other interest than Wolf Larsen and his presence weighed us down with an apprehension which prevented us from doing any of the little things we had planned
BTS When he had thus disappeared within his shelter of flame the whole pack came curiously to the rim of the fire to see what had become of him
BTS for if all labor and all capital shared profits the same conditions would obtain as did obtain when there was no profit-sharing
BTS The mob had been stopped in its wild attempt to break through
BTS He paused beside Scott and touched him on the shoulder saying ominously Don't break them teeth stranger
BTS Let me think
BTS Maud was waiting patiently for me and I took notice with a thrill of joy of the queenly poise of her head and her glorious calm eyes
BTS but he too had become a revolutionist though more disastrously than I for he was already dead and gone and none knew where nor how
BTS Indeed as I gazed at the heavy sea through which we were running I doubted that there was a boat afloat
BTS And as for my dreaming-- he put his hand in his pocket and drew out a small pamphlet--tell me if this looks like dream-stuff
BTS I liked him
BTS D'ye see the scars on me head where I was struck with flying bricks
BTS Fifty-two socialist Congressmen were tried and all were found guilty
BTS Must a' thought he had hold of seventeen devils the dog-musher sniggered
BTS I know with the possible exception of the incident of the dead mate that I have not seen him really angry
BTS The meal went on
BTS You do not know that Bishop Berkeley attested that his metaphysics did not work
BTS Still the Ghost tore along till the boat dwindled to a speck when Wolf Larsen's voice rang out in command and he went about on the starboard tack
BTS But I had preferred to use my head rather than my body
BTS But it was the will of the god and he strove to submit
BTS It would have to storm very hard I temporized
BTS CHAPTER VI ADUMBRATIONS It was about this time that the warnings of coming events began to fall about us thick and fast
BTS It had been slit from top to bottom along the centre seam and it pulsed rhythmically the slit opening and closing regularly with every leap of the wearer
BTS There was food
BTS She took the rabbit from him and while the sapling swayed and teetered threateningly above her she calmly gnawed off the rabbit's head
BTS Why
BTS The Ghost swung around into the wind and I finished my work forward in time to run aft and lend a hand with the mainsheet
BTS Not for nothing had I been called Sissy Van Weyden I thought as I tossed restlessly on my bunk between one nightmare and another
BTS At the same time there broke upon our ears a continuous and mighty bellowing
BTS Again and yet again White Fang sprang in slashed and got away untouched and still his strange foe followed after him without too great haste not slowly but deliberately and determinedly in a businesslike sort of way
BTS All right Hump he said in a low voice
BTS For the most part the remaining four hunters leaned on the table or lay in their bunks and left the discussion to the two antagonists
BTS Soon we were in the green country and I took one last glance back at the smoke-filled sky
BTS We will put back industry to its pre-trust stage
BTS James Smith was a hard-faced man and my heart sank as I encountered him
BTS The doctors recommended a sea voyage and I chose the longest
BTS Wolf Larsen walking up and down with Smoke and in conversation took no more notice of him though he cried sharply once to the man at the wheel You're off your course my man
BTS and such pride was mine that I felt I must rise up and cry out to the assembled company He is mine
BTS I was fascinated by the fascinated look he bent upon Maud
BTS cried the Bishop
BTS He waited
BTS While he smelled it he kept his eyes on the god
BTS And the idea of the solidarity of labor so evidenced appealed to the imagination of all
BTS he demanded impatiently
BTS Let me see it means something about cooperation doesn't it
BTS An' right here I want to remark Bill went on that that animal's familyarity with campfires is suspicious an' immoral
BTS Maud received my report with obvious relief and the sight of smoke which later rose in the galley put her in a more cheerful mood
BTS And as she had followed the trend of my silence she now followed the trend of my speech and she knew that I was going aboard not because of condensed milk and marmalade but because of her and of her anxiety which she knew she had failed to hide
BTS But there we were at the head of the column instead of in its middle and we were being swept out of life by a torrent of shrieking lead
BTS But he mustn't lose any chance that might be of help to him Judge Scott exclaimed
BTS No because the United States has herself a surplus
BTS That was why the machine caught him
BTS He sprang for me with a half-roar gripping my arm
BTS We are so close to land
BTS Then there was a ragged telegram describing an outbreak of the populace in New York City in which the labor castes were joining concluding with the statement intended to be accepted as a bluff that the troops had the situation in hand
BTS Johnson seems to spend all his spare time there or aloft at the crosstrees watching the Ghost cleaving the water under press of sail
BTS I want to tell you again Hump he said threateningly that you'd better leave things alone
BTS Also their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished
BTS I queried
BTS Quite right quite right
BTS And third the introduction of our own secret agents into every branch of the Oligarchy--into the labor castes and especially among the telegraphers and secretaries and clerks into the army the agents-provocateurs and the slave-drivers
BTS He was in a rage himself a sane rage
BTS And for your own sake try to avoid witnessing as much as you can the brutalities of the ship
BTS He was friendly in a treacherous sort of way smiling into one's face the while he meditated some underhand trick as for instance when he stole from Buck's food at the first meal
BTS Calvin confessed
BTS He could make a louder rasping growl than any of them
BTS I nodded my identity in turn
BTS H
BTS But man
BTS Here at last was something ready to hand
BTS But just think of how much smaller I shall be before I die
BTS Hello Hump he said
BTS And in his action I found complete refutation of all Wolf Larsen's materialism
BTS From time to time I forsook my own thoughts to follow him and I followed in amaze mastered for the moment by his remarkable intellect under the spell of his passion for he was preaching the passion of revolt
BTS You have only Weedon's opinion for that rejoined the judge
BTS But I soothed and comforted her till she pulled herself bravely together and recuperated mentally as quickly as she was wont to do physically
BTS This necessitated my climbing the shears which I did twice before I finished guying it fore and aft and to either side
BTS The salient thing of this other world seemed fear
BTS Maud Brewster and I scarcely touched the food before us gazing instead in silent anxiety at each other and listening to Wolf Larsen's voice which easily penetrated the cabin through the intervening bulkhead
BTS We meet combination with greater combination
BTS He stood watching and waiting
BTS When he dragged the result of his day's hunt into the cave the she-wolf inspected it turned her muzzle to him and lightly licked him on the neck
BTS Then here's a compact he went on consummate actor
BTS Each word was a blasphemy and there were many words
BTS White Fang was to her a wolf the hereditary marauder who had preyed upon her flocks from the time sheep were first herded and guarded by some dim ancestor of hers
BTS Every two or three days a steamer another and colossal manifestation of power came into the bank and stopped for several hours
BTS Mary McKenna lives south of Market Street
BTS He is a shrewd lawyer
BTS The naked earth which so shortly before had been so populous
BTS Henry nodded his consent
BTS Buck stalked into the open half crouching body gathered compactly together tail straight and stiff feet falling with unwonted care
BTS I remembered her Good-night Humphrey
BTS Thomas Mugridge crawled weakly across the galley floor and a short lurch of the Ghost sent him staggering
BTS One of them Mr
BTS But the supply of food and the nine breakers of water enabled the boat to stand up to the sea and wind and I held on as long as I dared
BTS The hollows under fallen trees seemed to attract her and she spent much time nosing about among the larger snow-piled crevices in the rocks and in the caves of overhanging banks
BTS You are well-rounded a blue-stocking fit to be the wife of a pirate chief
BTS Humphrey Van Weyden she said you are a brave man
BTS Give 'm a chance Matt counselled
BTS To hell with a look-out I heard Wolf Larsen say when we had eaten and drunk our fill
BTS She sat up and began making her simple toilet
BTS And as I faced him with levelled gun shaking in my hands I had time to note the worn and haggard appearance of his face
BTS He crouched down on the lip of the cave and gazed out on the world
BTS The wind was freshening rapidly the Ghost heeling over more and more and by the time the state-room was ready she was dashing through the water at a lively clip
BTS Perhaps it was the weight of his hand perhaps his justice perhaps the sheer power of him and perhaps it was all these things that influenced White Fang
BTS At such moments panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes fixed upon the big bull it appeared to Buck that a change was coming over the face of things
BTS Both were eligible for the militia and both were drafted to serve in the punitive expedition that was despatched from California against the farmers of Missouri
BTS He could expect no aid in all God's world
BTS but I succeeded in answering quite calmly All will come right Miss Brewster
BTS Good or bad
BTS I remember only one part of the service I said and that is And the body shall be cast into the sea
BTS A band of twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber and chief among them was a great bull
BTS Maud looked entreaty at me
BTS and despite the prohibition of the civil authorities and the persecution for disobedience the flames of religious frenzy were fanned by countless camp-meetings
BTS The jerks perceptibly diminished
BTS This young wolf had attained his full size
BTS She's given them that kind of fun before
BTS and during that brief time I was proud of myself and I grew to love the heave and roll of the Ghost under my feet as she wallowed north and west through the tropic sea to the islet where we filled our water-casks
BTS Thereafter fore and aft I was known by no other name until the term became a part of my thought-processes and I identified it with myself thought of myself as Hump as though Hump were I and had always been I
BTS It's a lie and you know it
BTS 'Ere she comes
BTS Henry squatting over the fire and settling the pot of coffee with a piece of ice nodded
BTS Jock Horner quiet as was his way gave no sign
BTS He stepped quickly to his state-room
BTS chorused the women
BTS the men pulling and hauling and two of them climbing aloft
BTS I was just a-wonderin' that is all
BTS again
BTS He was in evening dress and what of his broad shoulders and kingly head he looked magnificent
BTS Look at that hunter iv mine Horner
BTS What the hell are you up to
BTS He turned it over with his paw
BTS A thoughtless whim seized Thornton and he drew the attention of Hans and Pete to the experiment he had in mind
BTS Yes I have considered yours frequently I answered puzzling over what I had seen in her eyes and puzzled by her sudden change of subject
BTS It did not require much exertion to pick these quarrels
BTS Half a mile up the right fork his quick ears caught the sound of gnawing teeth
BTS From the point the shore curved away more and more to the south and west until at last it disclosed a cove within the cove a little land-locked harbour the water level as a pond broken only by tiny ripples where vagrant breaths and wisps of the storm hurtled down from over the frowning wall of rock that backed the beach a hundred feet inshore
BTS He broke out in mocking laughter then turned his left ear to the pillow as a sign that he wished no further conversation
BTS In spite of the bad weather and of the wind which especially hindered me I was on deck from daylight till dark and making substantial progress
BTS She was timid and afraid but she possessed courage
BTS He's all in poor devil muttered the master
BTS I testified to the effect that Jackson injured himself by neglect and carelessness and that the company was not in any way to blame or liable
BTS His sister and brother-in-law seconded him
BTS An' while I'm wishin' I wisht the trip was over an' done with an' you an' me a-sittin' by the fire in Fort McGurry just about now an' playing cribbage that's what I wisht
BTS Bill began to eat sleepily
BTS We were falling in the trough they were rising on the surge
BTS The clubs fell upon them unheeded
BTS The imprisonment of Wolf Larsen had happened most opportunely for what must have been the Indian summer of this high latitude was gone and drizzling stormy weather had set in
BTS It was in connection with the riding that White Fang achieved one other mode of expression remarkable in that he did it but twice in all his life
BTS It might be lying thus that he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand
BTS Maud who refused to stay alone ashore slept in the forecastle
BTS But in a short while his fear of the tepees passed away
BTS You know it won't was her reply
BTS It was impossible
BTS But it was his concern that they leave him alone in his isolation get out of his way when he elected to walk among them and at all times acknowledge his mastery over them
BTS What the devil can I do with a wolf in California
BTS And furthermore the trusts control the markets
BTS It was a trick I remembered of my sister and I knew she would soon be herself again
BTS Never was there such a dog said John Thornton one day as the partners watched Buck marching out of camp
BTS Heard you breathing of course
BTS But this proof never got anywhere
BTS For that matter I do him a kindness
BTS You could as easily control a lion while he would make a mock of you
BTS But first she hoisted an American flag and from under its folds she announced that by virtue of its protection they could not turn her out on to the cold street
BTS Ah it was sweet in my ears
BTS I had hoped to send them away to the country if I'd won Jackson's case
BTS In their desperation they ravaged the farms for food and the consequent tumult and anarchy in the country districts but increased the woes of the poor expropriated farmers
BTS To Buck it was boundless delight this hunting fishing and indefinite wandering through strange places
BTS Oh nothing he added softly as if he were drowsing
BTS I nodded at recollection of the vulpine-face superintendent of the Sierra Mills
BTS Haven't the least idea I said
BTS I did and it is because I did that I have a quarrel with you I challenged
BTS He may lie there all night
BTS The men and women who had worked the hand-looms for themselves now went into the factories and worked the machine-looms not for themselves but for the capitalist owners
BTS This had occurred several times
BTS 2 the Pennsylvania railway group Schiff financial manager with big banking firms of Philadelphia and New York
BTS J
BTS And yet you call me anarchist
BTS It was not until the coming of the Brotherhood of Man that the leg-bar passed out of use
BTS It beat steadily and strong and was quite normal
BTS The fire died down and the gleaming eyes drew closer the circle they had flung about the camp
BTS why he comes a-buttin' round the Godforsaken ends of the earth that's what I can't exactly see
BTS It would not work
BTS This served as a relish and his hunger increased mightily
BTS No story is too long for the scientist Ernest said sweetly
BTS You must be well up in mathematics I said
BTS A draggled muslin cap on his head and a dirty gunny-sack about his slim hips proclaimed him cook of the decidedly dirty ship's galley in which I found myself
BTS To antithesis was due his naming
BTS After a time the ptarmigan ceased her struggling
BTS I really must sit down Maud said with a nervous laugh and a dizzy gesture and forthwith she sat down on the sand
BTS Your chest heaves and strains
BTS The seven great trusts working together had pooled their enormous surpluses and made a farm trust
BTS It hummed and buzzed unceasingly
BTS You might learn in time to stand on your own legs and perhaps to toddle along a bit
BTS And I won't be in no hurry about it
BTS And as I looked into Maud's clear brown eyes I forgot the evil he had done and I knew only that I loved her and that because of her the strength was mine to win our way back to the world
BTS After that the rest would be easy
BTS But at two in the morning his anxiety drove him out to the cold front stoop where he crouched and waited
BTS Correct Scott answered passing the money over to him
BTS It was the old village changed to a new place
BTS They increased the amounts of the bets
BTS The wave over-topped the Ghost and I gazed sheer up and into it
BTS Its serenity and certitude was terrifying
BTS But Maud and I had a way of voicing each other's thoughts and she said as we prepared to hoist the mainsail To think Humphrey you did it all with your own hands
BTS It puzzled White Fang
BTS Oh believe me we had many comforts
BTS It was unprecedented
BTS Profit-sharing could be successful only in isolated cases in the midst of a system of industrial strife
BTS You damn little sneak
BTS They saw only the effects and the effects were bad
BTS Its function is to serve the established by moulding public opinion and right well it serves it
BTS So sudden was it and so unexpected that Buck was taken aback
BTS Then there were cats and rabbits and turkeys
BTS Yet you have not learned their lesson
BTS Together they crashed to the floor
BTS This was reputed to be the fastest train in the world then
BTS We found that labor could buy back with its wages only so much of the product and that capital did not consume all of the remainder of the product
BTS As you love me was what he whispered
BTS This word arthurization has long puzzled the etymologists but its derivation I hope is now made clear
BTS He perceived and determined and responded in the same instant
BTS The bird made a startled rise but he struck it with his paw and smashed it down to earth then pounced upon it and caught it in his teeth as it scuttled across the snow trying to rise in the air again
BTS But a fountain of blood was gushing forth
BTS When his eyes conveyed to his brain the moving image of an action his brain without conscious effort knew the space that limited that action and the time required for its completion
BTS He drew attention to me
BTS It surged past my vision in concrete waves of wrath snarling and growling carnivorous drunk with whiskey from pillaged warehouses drunk with hatred drunk with lust for blood--men women and children in rags and tatters dim ferocious intelligences with all the godlike blotted from their features and all the fiendlike stamped in apes and tigers anaemic consumptives and great hairy beasts of burden wan faces from which vampire society had sucked the juice of life bloated forms swollen with physical grossness and corruption withered hags and death's-heads bearded like patriarchs festering youth and festering age faces of fiends crooked twisted misshapen monsters blasted with the ravages of disease and all the horrors of chronic innutrition--the refuse and the scum of life a raging screaming screeching demoniacal horde
BTS You can never guess the ways iv him
BTS Couldn't drive 'em away from the fire with a club Bill agreed
BTS This group of madmen met frequently and passed wholesale judgments upon offending members and servitors of the Oligarchy
BTS They were very lean mere skin-bags stretched over bony frames with strings for muscles so lean that Henry found it in his mind to marvel that they still kept their feet and did not collapse forthright in the snow
BTS You were looking squeamish this afternoon he began
BTS The only change noticeable in our boats was that they had hauled close on the wind and were heading several points west of north
BTS That dog of yourn won't let me lay a finger on your stuff
BTS As for myself I found it most enjoyable
BTS By now I had developed such skill at surgery that Wolf Larsen with a few words of advice left me to my task with a couple of sailors for assistants
BTS Everywhere the socialists proclaimed their coming victory at the ballot-box while in unmistakable terms they stated the situation
BTS That Hal's views on art or the sort of society plays his mother's brother wrote should have anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood passes comprehension
BTS The yeast has grown stale
BTS In fact they were badly wounded and having thrashed them he proceeded to operate upon them in a rough surgical fashion and to dress their wounds
BTS Nothing could destroy its exquisite oval its well-nigh classic lines its delicately stencilled brows its large brown eyes clear-seeing and calm gloriously calm
BTS The fact is a man gets tired after he's been working for hours
BTS I--I--think some of his blood is dripping from our roof-beams
BTS Beauty Smith was known far and wide as the weakest of weak-kneed and snivelling cowards
BTS Retreating before Lip-lip White Fang made an indirect flight that led in and out and around the various tepees of the camp
BTS Day by day the trusts squeeze out the farmers as they squeezed out Mr
BTS The woman in front doubled up and went down her hands on her abdomen in a frenzied clutch
BTS Again I strove to call out but made no sound
BTS And he could do nothing
BTS This the Plutocracy found an easy task
BTS No salt mines this time Smoke
BTS Wolf Larsen was still waiting an explanation and I pointed down to my knees
BTS Sailing one direction drifting another direction to say nothing of the set of the current in some third direction makes a resultant which dead reckoning can never calculate
BTS I still insist you are dreaming Mr
BTS Owen murmured We would not go into the militia
BTS The men toiled without speech across the face of the frozen world
BTS Sierra Vista was a far vaster affair than the tepee of Grey Beaver
BTS It was unprecedented
BTS A little later he got the floor again and in his characteristic way controlled it for the rest of the evening
BTS That's the only reason
BTS that arose out of coarse feelings and blunted sensibilities from natures that knew neither courtesy nor gentleness
BTS Great
BTS White Fang looked on with a wondering eye
BTS You will please stay on deck Miss Brewster Wolf Larsen said as he started forward to meet his guest
BTS Very good
BTS I don't know what but it is coming
BTS On looking back I realize that the remark was too obvious to make rejoinder necessary
BTS Always they broke camp in the dark and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them
BTS I could kill the man who robbed me he interrupted
BTS I stiffened myself to refuse and shook my head
BTS while a dog thus overthrown invariably exposed for a moment the soft underside of its neck the vulnerable point at which to strike for its life
BTS This too I learned and quickly for I felt somehow a wild desire to vindicate myself in Wolf Larsen's eyes to prove my right to live in ways other than of the mind
BTS The Macedonia repeated her performance of yesterday hogging the sea by dropping her line of boats in advance of ours and across our course
BTS The first day they covered thirty-five miles to the Big Salmon
BTS The other and spiritual side of their natures has been dwarfed atrophied in fact
BTS But he had recovered himself
BTS He couldn't fool me
BTS And return to the ways of your fathers Ernest finished for him
BTS But in the past you have eaten more than I have
BTS At least speaking for myself I know I am braver than Captain Larsen
BTS A nice lot of gazabas you are
BTS He became again sane
BTS Your premise is wrong
BTS Johansen who had seen the affair from the break of the poop sent a couple of sailors aft to clean up the mess
BTS He raised himself on his flippers with an angry movement
BTS We need no distress signal Maud said
BTS Her hands were soon sadly blistered but she struggled bravely on and in addition doing the cooking and taking care of the sick man
BTS The Yukon was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down
BTS The Martinez was sinking fast for the water was very near
BTS Several days went by the Ghost still foaming down the trades and I could swear I saw madness growing in Thomas Mugridge's eyes
BTS There goes my chance of promotion Garthwaite laughed as a woman bore down on the wounded man brandishing a butcher's cleaver
BTS In the intervals we could hear the soldiers talking and swearing as they rummaged among the carcasses urged on by their officers to hurry up
BTS He continued to publish the advertisements for which he no longer received pay
BTS The great German war-lord prepared and so did the United States prepare
BTS The rabbit sped down the river turned off into a small creek up the frozen bed of which it held steadily
BTS And there was no fat about him
BTS The only change in it that they could notice was an accession of alertness
BTS But these were accidents
BTS No girl could live in a university town till she was twenty-four and not have love experiences
BTS and I flatter myself that I did his work well
BTS The newspapers showered him with praise and honor and commended him for having given up the drudgery of the lecture room in order to devote his whole time to scientific research
BTS The next moment the flash of yellow reappeared before his eyes
BTS The book created a furor and was promptly suppressed by the Oligarchy
BTS And then there were our sweet stolen moments in the midst of our work--just a word or caress or flash of love-light
BTS It was the nose of a being born to conquer and command
BTS Hammerfield was pained
BTS As courier for the Canadian Government bearing important despatches he was anxious to secure the best dogs and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of Buck
BTS Gongs sounded on the Martinez
BTS He heard again the intimidating cry and at the same instant received a sharp blow on the side of the neck and felt the sharp teeth of the mother-weasel cut into his flesh
BTS He confessed that he never made any profits out of his quarry and this in spite of the enormous volume of business that had been caused by the destruction of San Francisco by the big earthquake
BTS Rioting and mob-rule reigned throughout the rural districts
BTS There was Bishop Morehouse
BTS Had he fallen and dripped his brains upon the deck like honey from the comb there would have been no loss to the world
BTS And again with never-failing wonder I remarked the total lack of viciousness or wickedness or sinfulness in his face
BTS First he was evidently a valuable possession of the master's and next he was undemonstrative
BTS You have no fictions no dreams no ideals
BTS All she had to do was to beckon a man to her
BTS He slept long hours and dreamed much and through his mind passed an unending pageant of Northland visions
BTS Even now the Plutocracy is taking it away from you
BTS Mush on poor sore feets the driver encouraged them as they tottered down the main street of Skaguay
BTS A lie
BTS Again Hal's whip fell upon the dogs
BTS He heard nothing saw nothing yet knew that the land was somehow different
BTS Or if you do not wish to be boosted just yet why not boost Cooky
BTS I had not seen him for so long and the thought of a possible hitch or error in our plans that would keep him still in his island prison almost drove me mad
BTS while the dogs were learning more and more that it was better to be at peace with him than at war and Grey Beaver was coming to prize him more greatly with the passage of each day
BTS But he is not always alone
BTS The reinvestments of income were adding their mite of many annual millions
BTS Whereat he would laugh and his arms would leap out to me and he would call me his sweet metaphysician
BTS We all knew that something terrible was imminent
BTS I cast off the tackles and leaped after her
BTS They've invited me in order to tear me to pieces
BTS He watched and learned
BTS John Thornton compressed his lips
BTS I may make or break you
BTS The door was opened wider
BTS The Iron Heel learned its lesson
BTS Light came at nine o'clock
BTS This but served to make the god more wrathful
BTS It was in line with these experiences that White Fang came to learn the law of property and the duty of the defence of property
BTS Damn it all man
BTS When they came opposite our stern Wolf Larsen greeted them with a wave of the hand and cried Come on board and have a 'gam'
BTS and where it was not striking it was being turned out by the capitalists
BTS A laugh went up at my appearance a laugh that was not lessened or softened by the dead man stretched and grinning on the deck before us
BTS CHAPTER XVII THE SCARLET LIVERY With the destruction of the Granger states the Grangers in Congress disappeared
BTS Very true Ernest answered
BTS Now are we indeed saved
BTS Before closing this incident I must give a scrap of conversation I had with Wolf Larsen in the cabin while I was washing the dishes
BTS and it was her husband and family and toy
BTS He's all hunky with the officials
BTS Wright United States Commissioner of Labor is responsible for the statement
BTS Also he saw Wolf Larsen's rifle bearing upon him and knew he would be shot ere he could get his rifle into play
BTS I asked in alarm
BTS In the United States to-day in spite of all your so-called labor legislation there are three millions of child laborers
BTS He next ordered Miss Brewster below and smiled at the instant horror that leapt into her eyes
BTS And he did it out of sheer love of man and for man he gave his life and was crucified
BTS He had attacked Johnson been attacked by Leach and had just finished whipping the pair of them
BTS Time was flying and they should have been on the trail an hour gone
BTS These I afterward learned were the hunters the men who shot the seals and a very superior breed to common sailor-folk
BTS It ran lightly on the surface of the snow while the dogs ploughed through by main strength
BTS When I arose at seven I saw no sign of Maud and concluded she was in the galley preparing breakfast
BTS Old One Eye was rapidly overhauling the fleeing shape of white
BTS The others had been born earlier in the year and were nine and ten months old while White Fang was only eight months old
BTS Here was fear and it did not require his instinct to tell him of it
BTS The cub saw little of the battle
BTS Then came the search for a place to descend which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope and night found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the day's credit
BTS Nothing was happening where we were
BTS The fog though it remained had lifted high where it obscured the stars and made the night quite black
BTS There are three big classes in society
BTS When I asked them flatly to assist Jackson they as flatly refused
BTS These were so many suggestions
BTS He had grown rich with his trading and stood in need of nothing
BTS I have not been sure he was saying and I have told no one
BTS That's a hundred and fifty dollars a month
BTS I asked
BTS Especially did they enjoy the havoc worked amongst the newcomers' dogs by White Fang and his disreputable gang
BTS He could turn and whirl swiftly enough but White Fang was never there
BTS She seemed to me like a being from another world
BTS One Ear didn't get no fish
BTS It was two in the afternoon and a ghostly twilight shot through by wandering purplish lights had descended upon us
BTS He would have asked for nothing better than an opportunity to loose his war-dogs on his rebellious proletariat
BTS Plainly I read between the lines that our plot had been discovered that we had been countermined
BTS I looked closely but was not sure until exclamations broke out on all sides
BTS But he was not compelled to take injustice from the other gods
BTS There would be a fleeting glimpse of the three men flinging water in frantic haste when she would topple over and fall into the yawning valley bow down and showing her full inside length to the stern upreared almost directly above the bow
BTS Johansen however continued violently to urge him on to the completion of his task
BTS Then he realised that this was Mit-sah one of his own particular gods who was being maltreated
BTS Somehow Tommy's grub always tastes of grease stale grease and I reckon he ain't changed his shirt since he left 'Frisco
BTS Just as I thought
BTS The master was running up but was too far away
BTS He suddenly released me and staggered away
BTS What are you doing
BTS In midsummer White Fang had an experience
BTS A smoke pall shot through with lurid gleams filled the sky
BTS By his comrades he was called The Flame
BTS Don't you see you poor perishing middle class you are caught between the upper and nether millstones and even now has the grinding begun
BTS I noticed at the same time that the Kanaka's knuckles were laid open clear across and to the bone
BTS into street railways into national state and municipal bonds
BTS We're all solid with the corporations he answered
BTS Dr
BTS Where are the old-time owners of the coal fields
BTS Pervaise was an American of French descent who in 1913 A
BTS she said
BTS but there is enough of the artist in me to appreciate its wonder
BTS With the exception of Collie all things went well with White Fang
BTS And you too Mr
BTS The four winds had been loosed
BTS As Ernest said all that was the matter with him was that he had incorrect notions of biology and sociology and because of his incorrect notions he had not gone about it in the right way to rectify matters
BTS We cannot follow you
BTS A hint of stiff-leggedness on their part a lifted lip or a bristle of hair and he would be upon them merciless and cruel swiftly convincing them of the error of their way
BTS He seems consuming with the tremendous power that is in him and that seems never to have found adequate expression in works
BTS Van Weyden was Wolf Larsen's command
BTS Did he lie down to sleep he was stirred up by a sharp stick so that the audience might get its money's worth
BTS I asked
BTS You heard Wickson talk the other night
BTS Here goes I said backing water with one oar and running the bow ashore
BTS In the midst of the wreckage of overthrown and smashed furniture partly on his side his face hidden by an arm lay a man
BTS After that I don't give a rap what happens
BTS I hesitated
BTS As we followed it north we began to encounter the dreaded sea-fogs
BTS It knew no body
BTS As the impetus that carried Cherokee forward died down he continued to go forward of his own volition in a swift bow-legged run
BTS The red-faced man shot a glance up at the pilot-house gazed around at the fog stumped across the deck and back he evidently had artificial legs and stood still by my side legs wide apart and with an expression of keen enjoyment on his face
BTS Caste lines formed automatically
BTS I reasoned that a helpless man could start a fire only near to where he lay
BTS This was not Bill's way for he was easily angered by sharp words
BTS The time is not far distant when some unknown will arise in England and the critics will name her the English Maud Brewster
BTS And now they're payin' their respects to each other and tryin' to get clear the red-faced man went on as the hurried whistling ceased
BTS and Mr
BTS There is such a thing as moral courage and moral courage is never without effect
BTS And she answered There is no need though the telling of it would be sweet so sweet
BTS That which was given unto him did he return
BTS CHAPTER II I seemed swinging in a mighty rhythm through orbit vastness
BTS Go away
BTS Fire is fanned by the wind until it leaps up fiercely
BTS Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley
BTS And furthermore every one of our imprisoned leaders was in contact with brave comrades who masqueraded in the livery of the Iron Heel
BTS I returned with the articles in time to hear the Cockney hinting broadly that there was a mystery about him that he might be a gentleman's son gone wrong or something or other
BTS Again I fled to the boat hotly pursued
BTS Henry whistled long and comprehendingly
BTS But when I got him into his bunk he again buried his face in his hands covering his eyes and as I turned to go I could hear him murmuring I am a sick man a very sick man
BTS But why should there be a conflict
BTS Johnson hesitated but the long years of obedience to the masters of ships overpowered him and he dropped sullenly to the deck and went on forward
BTS Ernest could not make himself heard but he remained on his feet waiting for a lull
BTS This man had saved his life which was something
BTS And of what use has it been
BTS The cub who had thus received a name in the world lay and watched
BTS He was a man beaten at birth
BTS It was a very lonely soul I was to learn that never unmasked though at rare moments it played at doing so
BTS Also the dog-driver rubbed Buck's feet for half an hour each night after supper and sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for Buck
BTS Hungry as he was he would not move to receive his ration of fish which Francois had to bring to him
BTS They might laugh among themselves about anything they pleased except himself and he did not mind
BTS Wolf Larsen evidently had sifted the great philosopher's teachings rejecting and selecting according to his needs and desires
BTS Of the meagreness of a child's life
BTS What
BTS At least that's our name for it I amended
BTS It is not given us to know how some animals know laughter and know when they are being laughed at
BTS Van Weyden I congratulate you
BTS And camp they did till Buck's ribs knitted and he was able to travel
BTS So important did it seem to the priest that he had the confession taken down in writing and sworn to
BTS Hump he said to me elaborately polite kindly take Mr
BTS The street-car strike in San Francisco had been broken
BTS I was jerked from swing to counter swing with irritating haste
BTS If he had been a gliding shadow before he now became the ghost of such a shadow as he crept and circled around and came up well to leeward of the silent motionless pair
BTS Something had happened
BTS and all three rode on railroad passes
BTS She was wrapped in a long ulster for the morning was raw
BTS There was about him no consciousness of sin
BTS But his hugeness could not quite overcome his apprehensiveness
BTS Now Girard Kansas was a quiet peaceable town
BTS In the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of their animals
BTS Well Matthewson said slowly and deliberately so that all could hear I've got a thousand dollars that says he can't
BTS And then taking no further account of me he turned his back and went up on deck
BTS he gritted out
BTS He did not know any other place much less of a way to get there
BTS I thought
BTS Sure the dog-musher answered
BTS Good-night
BTS It seemed to me that I was realizing for the first time what a delicate fragile creature a woman is
BTS Because you can't
BTS Maud even contrived at times when all my efforts could not budge the windlass to hold the turn with one hand and with the other to throw the weight of her slim body to my assistance
BTS Come on now right here amongst ourselves and be honest for once
BTS Once 'e got 'is 'and on the knife an' tried to 'old it
BTS This phenomenon fascinated me for a time while my senses were coming back to me
BTS The Wall Street group turned the stock market into a maelstrom where the values of all the land crumbled away almost to nothingness
BTS Never better was her answer
BTS My best you may be sure which wasn't much under the circumstances
BTS But how is it possible to be done
BTS Then a panic seized the Yeehats and they fled in terror to the woods proclaiming as they fled the advent of the Evil Spirit
BTS They were leaping straight for him and the Factor
BTS Not only did they escape but every one of them won to the refuges as planned
BTS I was armed with the regular club with which the boat-pullers killed the wounded seals gaffed aboard by the hunters
BTS A dead silence greeted her appearance
BTS She pecked on his nose which by now what of previous adventures was sore
BTS Grey Beaver was offering him one piece of the tallow
BTS He had not mended his ways nor his shirt though the latter he contended he had changed
BTS He rubbed his eyes and looked at them more sharply
BTS No wonder I was sleeping brokenly
BTS To all of which Ernest would shake his head and say How many rifles have you got
BTS But each hunter this day had his rifle and a large supply of cartridges
BTS Sometimes they went hungry sometimes they feasted riotously all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting
BTS In their presence Mit-sah would give him meat and would give it to him only
BTS I hesitated the desire to race back and up the steps to the deck almost overpowering me
BTS He can only give you a boost on the path you eternally must tread
BTS The deserted boat was in the trough of the sea rolling drunkenly across each comber its loose spritsail out at right angles to it and fluttering and flapping in the wind
BTS The automobiles were blown to fragments along with many soldiers
BTS It's all right it's all right I reassured her my arm passing instinctively and protectingly around her
BTS The door of the pen was being opened again
BTS There was one other man who was quizzed by Ernest at this juncture a Mr
BTS ' Father paused
BTS But when mother died his own work could not fill the emptiness
BTS He was delighted
BTS He sprang at the foremost man it was the chief of the Yeehats ripping the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood
BTS He did not dare it under the circumstances for he had only Louis and me to depend upon and Louis was even now at the wheel
BTS But now it was different
BTS How could I explain to her the situation the strange man who stalked the sea like Destiny all that it had taken me months to learn
BTS He loved to play Chinese lottery
BTS They are strong efficient men
BTS For a day and a night he remained by the kill eating and sleeping turn and turn about
BTS We are braver I hastened to say
BTS You just bet I did was the fervent reply
BTS The veranda seemed suddenly to have become small when Ernest arrived
BTS The lips moved under her fingers and she answered Yes
BTS when the face of his spirit had become iron and all his instincts and axioms had crystallised into set rules cautions dislikes and desires
BTS The other looked at him incredulously
BTS the Supreme Court of the United States declared this law to be unconstitutional
BTS I was puzzled by the strangeness of it
BTS Furthermore she was a genius and lovable and we could never discipline her anyway
BTS Many events are focussed sharply on my brain but between these indelible pictures I retain are intervals of unconsciousness
BTS We will hunt the bear
BTS A hundred yards away I saw the boat-puller pass a rifle to the hunter
BTS The filth of his cooking was indescribable
BTS There is no accounting for it
BTS And when I came down amongst the poor I found those who had been robbed and who were hungry and wretched because they had been robbed
BTS I say why not
BTS That you are at least consistent was all I could say and I went on washing the dishes
BTS No five
BTS Johnson turned obediently to the door at the same time over the cook's shoulder favouring me with an amazingly solemn and portentous wink as though to emphasize his interrupted remark and the need for me to be soft-spoken with the captain
BTS That most exact and convincing of all sciences mathematics is sheerly metaphysical
BTS We know what we're about
BTS Everhard might have drawn a better illustration from the Southern Church's outspoken defence of chattel slavery prior to what is known as the War of the Rebellion
BTS You caught me feeding his lambs you know
BTS Lord Avebury an Englishman uttered the following in the House of Lords The unrest in Europe the spread of socialism and the ominous rise of Anarchism are warnings to the governments and the ruling classes that the condition of the working classes in Europe is becoming intolerable and that if a revolution is to be avoided some steps must be taken to increase wages reduce the hours of labor and lower the prices of the necessaries of life
BTS Wolf Larsen's voice brought me sharply back to myself
BTS I did not see what went on elsewhere though I felt the sudden surge and heel of the schooner as the wind-pressures changed to the jibing of the fore- and main-sails
BTS on the other hand it even gives you delight
BTS Once and twice he sleepily brushed his nose with his paw
BTS So we thought
BTS But the rest of the hands had a lively fear of consequences to come and gave no heed to him
BTS He was afraid of them
BTS I was overjoyed
BTS Weedon Scott saw and nodded
BTS He continued to gaze and in his interest he forgot to snarl
BTS but in the Northland under the law of club and fang whoso took such things into account was a fool and in so far as he observed them he would fail to prosper
BTS The she-wolf's need to find the thing for which she searched had now become imperative
BTS It was the custom he said to send reporters to all the socialist meetings for the express purpose of misreporting and distorting what was said in order to frighten the middle class away from any possible affiliation with the proletariat
BTS Utility is the better word
BTS so was this governor and this supreme court judge
BTS Of course it's all right because it comes out all right don't you see
BTS He still held her by the wing and they lay on the ground and looked at each other
BTS but there was more to it than this
BTS His method was to drive straight at the intruder and to sink his teeth in if he could
BTS That is all
BTS The latter's cap came off after the custom of the sea and he stood respectfully in the centre of the cabin swaying heavily and uneasily to the roll of the schooner and facing the captain
BTS Think of it
BTS in pain and sorrow at the oath
BTS Cherokee identified himself with his instinct
BTS Of course I answered
BTS The point is that the strength of the Oligarchy today lies in its satisfied conception of its own righteousness
BTS Then there was the crashing about of the entwined bodies the laboured breathing the short quick gasps of sudden pain
BTS While from Kansas or Wisconsin or any other state your own comrades would go into the militia and come here to California to drown in blood your own civil-warring
BTS You were not fair to yourself nor to me
BTS And we fled eastward through the quiet streets prepared at every cross street for anything to happen
BTS Where is the seat of your trouble
BTS belligerently demanded one Kelly an Irish-American and a longshoreman making his first trip to sea and boat-puller for Kerfoot
BTS Even as late as 1907 it was considered that eleven groups dominated the country but this number was reduced by the amalgamation of the five railroad groups into a supreme combination of all the railroads
BTS Spit it out
BTS We should be on the rocks first
BTS His teeth in passing burst the wall of the great vein of the throat
BTS He was made dizzy by the swarming of them
BTS He could take a ptarmigan from its nest kill a rabbit as it slept and snap in mid air the little chipmunks fleeing a second too late for the trees
BTS I was now concerned with fear for myself
BTS The man who had spoken came over to her
BTS And in that moment the sapling reared its slender length upright and the rabbit soared dancing in the air again
BTS And then there was the Bishop
BTS Why do you know that your father has three times as many chances for safety of life and limb than has a working-man
BTS Men despaired of matching him with an equal and Beauty Smith was compelled to pit wolves against him
BTS Look at us
BTS others stood on their feet watching him
BTS She is suffering from want of it
BTS Among other things they could increase an adult's stature by as much as four or five inches and decrease it by one or two inches
BTS Then the next moment we would lift and soar upward while they sank far down beneath us
BTS Hammerfield as Ernest once said has succeeded in modifying his metaphysics so as to give God's sanction to the Iron Heel and also to include much worship of beauty and to reduce to an invisible wraith the gaseous vertebrate described by Haeckel--the difference between Dr
BTS CHAPTER V THE LAW OF MEAT The cub's development was rapid
BTS As the sun was to the outside dweller this wall was to him the sun of his world
BTS she cried
BTS He was never disturbed over why a thing happened
BTS The money he had received for his furs and mittens and moccasins began to go
BTS and with the same cat-like swiftness he had slashed with his fangs and leaped clear
BTS He made no attempt to come ashore
BTS Next I became aware of stinging cheeks and nose and could feel blood dripping on my face
BTS Each building had to be stormed like a fort and the Mercenaries fought their way upward floor by floor
BTS Because he ran at the end of the longest rope the dogs had always the view of him running away before them
BTS He continued to grin with a sardonic humour with a cynical mockery and defiance
BTS Then we'll drop him over without any palavering unless our clerical-looking castaway has the burial service at sea by heart
BTS She's too smart to be shot in the open
BTS Again and again as he looked at each brutal performance the lesson was driven home to Buck a man with a club was a lawgiver a master to be obeyed though not necessarily conciliated
BTS But Ernest never lost his head in a situation
BTS He sucked meditatively at his pipe for some time before he went on
BTS With the fall of Constantinople in 1453 the Turks blocked the way of the caravans to India
BTS Now gentlemen follow me
BTS In truth his very death was incurred by his devotion to duty
BTS He sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great stiffness
BTS No high backbone of island sheltered us from the wind and it whistled and bellowed about the hut till at times I feared for the strength of the walls
BTS White Fang sprang to his feet and tore wildly around trying to shake off the bull-dog's body
BTS Here goes and bear with me if at first I seem irrelevant
BTS In the south-west and almost in our course I saw the pyramidal loom of some vessel's sails
BTS The cub received a clout on the other side of his head
BTS Head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth
BTS Every day I practised for hours in burying forever the old Avis Everhard beneath the skin of another woman whom I may call my other self
BTS I had stepped underneath the open hatchway so that I could see him
BTS The bull-dog did little but keep his grip
BTS In fact the very opposite was necessary
BTS Its effect on him was that of an impression of power
BTS There must be some less brutal way
BTS Better watch out Mr
BTS It was a knowledge bequeathed to him directly from the hunting generation of wolves
BTS Lip-lip became a nightmare to him
BTS That's our whole idea in a nutshell
BTS I saw the levelled revolver hesitate then sink down and heard the disgusted grunt of the policeman
BTS About his body there was a peculiar springiness or resiliency almost catlike and a quick alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of things seen and unseen
BTS Having completed my survey of the horizon I turned to my more immediate surroundings
BTS And as fast as capitalistic governments crashed cooperative commonwealths arose in their place
BTS It was better to eat small live things like ptarmigan chicks and to let alone large live things like ptarmigan hens
BTS Its members were fanatics madmen
BTS Nor until well out of sight did he stop to lick his bleeding wounds
BTS Scott who had been patting White Fang suddenly bent closer and pointed out fresh-made cuts on his muzzle and a gash between the eyes
BTS Harrison heard the order and understood what was demanded of him but hesitated
BTS The quiet water had become suddenly angry
BTS Thus it was that in obedience to the law laid down by his mother and in obedience to the law of that unknown and nameless thing fear he kept away from the mouth of the cave
BTS Gathering firewood and cooking dinner I answered lightly
BTS Grave dignified sombre a laugh made him frantic to ridiculousness
BTS He found himself an outcast in the midst of the populous camp
BTS I'll have you know that I do the swearing on this ship
BTS Oh Humphrey
BTS Looks for all the world like a big husky sled-dog Bill said
BTS It took Johansen insulting and reviling the poor wretch fully ten minutes to get him started again
BTS But Weedon Scott did not agree with his father
BTS Moral suasion was a thing unknown
BTS In the morning after several trials I found the point of balance in the foremast and attached my hoisting tackle a few feet above it
BTS It's a hell of a job Garthwaite grumbled
BTS There was a movement of the hand above him
BTS and when the whole arrangement was completed I could not but be startled by the power and latitude it gave me
BTS And here was where the difference came in
BTS Larsen I heard a muffled voice from within the mass
BTS His master rarely fed him
BTS that through it strange things were afoot and ranging
BTS The mate's gone so I can't afford to lose you too
BTS and again he ran at the head of the team the gut-whips of Mit-sah and Grey Beaver snapping behind their voices crying Ra
BTS And in vain he strove to gain the shelter of the cabin
BTS The lust to kill was on him
BTS While I was rigging it between the top of the spar and the opposite rail Wolf Larsen came on the scene
BTS The bonds of the flesh had little part in my cosmos of love
BTS The old man'll be wantin' yer on deck an' this ayn't no d'y to fall foul of 'im
BTS The master nodded his head
BTS Bah
BTS They walked always in the middle of the street
BTS He is overwrought
BTS The schooner Ghost bound seal-hunting to Japan
BTS He turned and leaped silently among his enemies
BTS As soon as the secret of the defection of the favored unions leaked out there were rumblings and mutterings in the labor world
BTS Fresh air was on my cheek and biting sweetly in my lungs
BTS This will mean deterioration of the labor castes and in the end they will become weaker and weaker
BTS There must be a full ward waiting for you
BTS He frankly states that the position he takes is based on no moral grounds that all the hunters could kill and eat one another so far as he is concerned were it not that he needs them alive for the hunting
BTS Without them he could not run his empire
BTS The boy glowered sullenly but refused to move
BTS I'll beat you out and I hope you no worse than that you rack your old engines into scrap
BTS I play the braver part
BTS All things are relative
BTS But you wrong me by withholding it I objected
BTS And not only did he learn by experience but instincts long dead became alive again
BTS he demanded or bellowed rather
BTS As well as I could make out the kneecap seemed turned up on edge in the midst of the swelling
BTS There was no whimpering nor wailing
BTS She was tired
BTS In other words because it wouldn't a-ben healthy he answered
BTS We were travelling faster and heeled farther over
BTS You'll find nothing gruesome down there he said only an unhurt man securely made fast to the ring-bolts
BTS He proceeded very slowly and cautiously an inch at a time
BTS It was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food
BTS At daybreak they limped warily back to camp to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers
BTS He had killed this god's dog bitten his companion god and what else was to be expected than some terrible punishment
BTS Dat Buck for sure learn queek as anyt'ing
BTS And yet he found time in which to love me and make me happy
BTS I cried reproachfully and reached for his book and opened it
BTS A crisis had come in world affairs
BTS For a moment I gazed upon the passion-wrought features of Peter Donnelly
BTS Look at me
BTS When you get a dollar hang on to it
BTS After his outbreak at the I
BTS We tried it
BTS He was impelled to do them and did not reason about them at all
BTS Look at that
BTS I looked hastily at the lantern
BTS What freak of fortune had brought it here here of all spots
BTS To make sure I returned and went through the steerage and forecastle and in the galley gathered up all the sharp meat and vegetable knives
BTS I
BTS but ah me little I knew him or knew that even then perhaps he was meditating an outbreak more terrible than any I had seen
BTS He did not deposit him at once in the bottom of the canoe
BTS An' so when I saw it run off across the snow I looked in the snow an' saw its tracks
BTS asked the imperturbable Smoke
BTS His comrades were on their feet wild with anger capable of any violence
BTS Even so Mr
BTS Matt shrugged his shoulders
BTS Buck did not comprehend that silent intentness nor the eager way with which they were licking their chops
BTS You are all playing the losing game and you are all squealing about it
BTS The case would not have been decided against him had there been no more to the affair than you have mentioned
BTS They were too cool-headed and courageous for that
BTS The manhood and the deep-hidden tender nature of their Bishop burst out and his Christian audience that loved him concluded that he was crazy
BTS We stopped the war with Germany
BTS Late at night two years after the Chicago Commune Ernest and I arrived together at the Benton Harbor refuge
BTS Corporations have been enthroned an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed
BTS then he turned and with the speed of an express train headed down upon him
BTS he asked
BTS I have no clothes nothing she objected
BTS Our brave comrades are coming Hartman said
BTS He did not know what to say
BTS It was scrawled over with geometrical diagrams and calculations of some sort
BTS On every hand were tall wooded knolls a group of them with all the seeming of having been flung there from some careless Titan's hand
BTS You are a man utterly without what the world calls morals
BTS The suddenness of it was stunning
BTS We were out of the Trades and the Ghost was forging ahead barely a knot an hour
BTS he cried down the open hatch
BTS A second hand took form in the darkness beside it
BTS But if the Oligarchy persists I asked him that evening what will become of the great surpluses that will fall to its share every year
BTS What's its bearings
BTS Then he would cast a glance of fear at the wolf-circle drawn expectantly about him and like a blow the realisation would strike him that this wonderful body of his this living flesh was no more than so much meat a quest of ravenous animals to be torn and slashed by their hungry fangs to be sustenance to them as the moose and the rabbit had often been sustenance to him
BTS The master stopped the carriage
BTS But when away from his god the pain and the unrest returned
BTS They loomed ominously above him
BTS The two men were murdered
BTS he had idle time in which to devote himself to thoughts of trickery
BTS By hand pressures after that he answered our questions and when he wished to speak he scrawled his thoughts with his left hand quite legibly on a sheet of paper
BTS He was almost at arm's length
BTS A fig for superstition I said on Friday morning
BTS Ernest shrugged his shoulders whimsically and accepted a cup of tea
BTS but he was cold under it all and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away
BTS But we do not know
BTS Not only did it use its own vast power but it used all the power of the United States Treasury to carry out its plans
BTS White Fang had now achieved a reputation in the land
BTS You are the champion of this whole audience
BTS Dr
BTS You're botherin' too much Bill came the sleepy response
BTS Imbecile
BTS Stay and watch it
BTS You must come now
BTS The second hut was easier to erect for I built it against the first and only three walls were required
BTS It did not seem possible that such frail craft could survive such stress of wind and water
BTS The hunters on the other hand had stronger and more diversified faces with hard lines and the marks of the free play of passions
BTS And as condition in his eyes had the seeming of form so he entered into what had been wall to him and bathed in the substance that composed it
BTS Say you lemme alone
BTS We are beaten
BTS Here was neither peace nor rest nor a moment's safety
BTS He has
BTS I had luncheon with Wilcox
BTS After a good day's killing I have seen our decks covered with hides and bodies slippery with fat and blood the scuppers running red
BTS She was without value to him
BTS he was demanding
BTS Even a man-animal a god White Fang ignored such was the terror he was in of losing his mother
BTS I could hardly believe my ears
BTS The sailor Johnson was swayed by idea by principle and truth and sincerity
BTS Henry propped himself up on an elbow and looked to see his comrade standing among the dogs beside the replenished fire his arms raised in objurgation his face distorted with passion
BTS but the blood she had lost had taken with it her strength and for all of a day and a night she lay by her dead foe's side without movement scarcely breathing
BTS I never knew what half a million dollars meant until I realized how much potatoes and bread and butter and meat it could buy
BTS ' But railways could not alone absorb rapidly enough those mighty floods of gold
BTS The guilty man or woman was placed in a specially constructed death-chair and under the supervision of competent physicians was destroyed by a current of electricity
BTS He did not check himself but drove in upon Spitz shoulder to shoulder so hard that he missed the throat
BTS I dwelt upon the idea
BTS As the fall of the year came on the moose appeared in greater abundance moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less rigorous valleys
BTS When the man brought him water he drank eagerly and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat chunk by chunk from the man's hand
BTS To be brutally beaten to be killed perhaps would not help my case
BTS Following the cook's instructions I had gone into Wolf Larsen's state-room to put it to rights and make the bed
BTS Especially interesting was Mr
BTS By them a large portion of the perplexing surplus was consumed
BTS Bill shoved his cup aside
BTS Of necessity many men were tried and condemned by proxy as in the case of General Lampton
BTS Every community was as completely isolated as though ten thousand miles of primeval wilderness stretched between it and the rest of the world
BTS Of a larger appetite and more luck in satisfying it
BTS One may see the soul stir in some men's eyes but his were bleak and cold and grey as the sea itself
BTS To him it signified death
BTS Charles and Hal begged her to get off and walk pleaded with her entreated the while she wept and importuned Heaven with a recital of their brutality
BTS Irresistible impulses seized him
BTS And furthermore I'm not done with you
BTS His small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light while he roared with fury at sight of Buck
BTS I glanced warily at him for I was on my knees taking the ashes from the stove
BTS It was patent that he had made a clean and secret sweep of everything before he disappeared
BTS She could not but know it as she swiftly drew away her hands and yet could not forbear one quick searching look before she turned away her eyes
BTS White Fang came in until he touched Grey Beaver's knee so curious was he and already forgetful that this was a terrible man-animal
BTS We were in imminent danger of being swamped by the whitecaps
BTS A general smile followed in which Wolf Larsen joined and the dinner went on smoothly thanks to me for he treated me abominably the rest of the meal sneering at me and patronizing me till I was all a-tremble with suppressed rage
BTS All this I saw and my brain now working rapidly I thought a thousand thoughts
BTS It remains for your breath to smash my prophecy
BTS Again I raised the gun
BTS As I drove away from Mrs
BTS That day they made forty miles the trail being packed
BTS He was awakened from self-consciousness but as he drew near his eyes took on a strange expression
BTS Cherokee wagged the stump of his tail in advertisement that he understood the meaning of the blows but that he knew he was himself in the right and only doing his duty by keeping his grip
BTS I Humphrey Van Weyden was in love
BTS Here it is The silver trumpets rang across the Dome
BTS There has been nothing like it in the history of the world
BTS The result was that the Iron Heel was firmly established in the New World
BTS You're a boat-puller now
BTS White Fang knew how to make it and when to make it
BTS We were already under way all sails set and drawing and the sheets being slacked off for a wind abeam as the last boat lifted clear of the water and swung in the tackles
BTS but he did not know the chewing method of fighting nor were his jaws adapted to it
BTS Wolf Larsen had returned to the poop and we stood in a silent group watching the lights rapidly cross our bow
BTS He could escape into safety while the god was scrambling to his feet
BTS Here the train was halted
BTS I held that space was an apparition of God and that soul was a projection of the character of God
BTS Then the boat emerged half swamped Leach flinging the water out and Johnson clinging to the steering-oar his face white and anxious
BTS With this triple killing his main troubles with dogs ceased
BTS At any rate it was a lie
BTS He was a master of law
BTS Very probably was Wolf Larsen's answer as he turned partly away from me and cried out Cooky
BTS Garthwaite and I at that time were trying to make our way westward to get out of the territory of street-fighting and we were caught right in the thick of it again
BTS Wolf Larsen was quite considerate the sailors helped me and I was no longer in irritating contact with Thomas Mugridge
BTS But to return to Harrison
BTS He burst upon them in a fury
BTS The penalty for failure was death
BTS and the two of them raged against each other unceasingly
BTS I could not reconcile these books with the man from what I had seen of him and I wondered if he could possibly read them
BTS But it is avoiding the real question I continued which is one of right
BTS There was no investigation no trial
BTS and Buck had memories of nights of vigil spent beneath trees wherein the hairy man roosted holding on tightly as he slept
BTS If for no other reason the memory of my poor old father and the way he was worked to death would prevent
BTS I could see a large black number on one of its sails and I had seen pictures of pilot-boats
BTS The forecastle scuttle was open
BTS But there was no rifle-firing for the reason that all their hunters were out in the boats or our prisoners
BTS Buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity
BTS Thus he was strong from the two days' eating a lynx had afforded him when the hungry wolf-pack ran full tilt upon him
BTS Also she was compelled to let her great colonies slip away from her
BTS Besides the women proved to be the strongest promoters of the strike
BTS After waiting several days father wrote to the secretary
BTS Besides it was not fear but terror that convulsed him
BTS His actions were theirs to command
BTS from a blind man
BTS As for Cooky if he isn't lively bat him between the eyes
BTS Doubt and distrust showed strongly in his face
BTS on wintry nights he lay at the Judge's feet before the roaring library fire
BTS We will I asserted still savagely for the destruction of my beloved shears had hit me hard
BTS I prophesied that you would not answer
BTS With one accord all eyes left the plates and settled on her
BTS This was the weapon the balloons used
BTS It was too good to lose but by nightfall I was exhausted
BTS A woman who earned eighteen hundred dollars a year was worth looking at
BTS An' in a box Henry answered
BTS Buck on the bank worried and anxious kept abreast of the boat his eyes never off his master
BTS I have thought about it often and I know
BTS It was the way he had learned
BTS I agree with you he answered
BTS That it was intrinsically valuable was a truism I had never questioned
BTS Not only does Thomas Mugridge continue to hate me but he has discovered a new reason for hating me
BTS A collision with the table partially knocked the wind from my body and brought me to myself
BTS His face was pale and he seemed suffering from nausea
BTS he demanded for the twentieth time with a helpless shrug of the shoulders
BTS I saw Mr
BTS I gave him rest--he who worked so hard for others my dear tired-eyed mortalist
BTS It was then that he sent for the Catholic priest Father Peter Durban and to him made confession
BTS She had been right
BTS How old is she
BTS In 1918 I was present at a meeting of the 'Frisco Reds
BTS Emotional delight is more filling and lasting than intellectual delight
BTS With nose serrulated by continuous spasms hair bristling in recurrent waves tongue whipping out like a red snake and whipping back again ears flattened down eyes gleaming hatred lips wrinkled back and fangs exposed and dripping he could compel a pause on the part of almost any assailant
BTS You have spoken much truth Mr
BTS I ground my teeth in my anger and determination till the man I was attending winced under my hand and Oofty-Oofty looked at me with curiosity
BTS Fore and aft there was nothing that could have surprised us more than his consequent behaviour
BTS days of calm when we floated on the lonely immensity of sea oppressed by its greatness and yet marvelling at the miracle of tiny life for we still lived and struggled to live
BTS And why can we not do it
BTS Life sums itself up to you in profits
BTS It seems unreal
BTS Can we trust our lives to it
BTS Ernest and his fellow-leaders from their prisons decided what should be done
BTS she drawled
BTS Everybody acknowledged Buck a magnificent animal but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their eyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings
BTS But don't do it just the same for I'd promptly break Mr
BTS What phrase
BTS to think and reason and in the spirit of him to be as alive as ever but in the flesh to be dead quite dead
BTS and now I hoisted the mainsail peak and throat at the same time
BTS I had never done any hard manual labour or scullion labour in my life
BTS Down
BTS but the next moment in a rush of anger he was upon Lip-lip and snapping viciously
BTS It was a long time before the cub left its shelter
BTS he had been cowed into subjection
BTS She recognized a flight that midmost broke
BTS We explain the nature of the conflict of interest that produces the class struggle
BTS The team dispersed in ignominious defeat and it was not until after dark that the dogs came sneaking back one by one by meekness and humility signifying their fealty to White Fang
BTS The executions were afterward apportioned by lot
BTS Another day of heart-breaking and dangerous toil saw us in camp with the two topmasts to the good
BTS This faithfulness was a quality of the clay that composed him
BTS A boat was being lowered
BTS it was that fabled sixth sense which conveyed to him the loom and feel of an object close at hand
BTS The burning of the great ghetto on the South Side had driven them forth into the inferno of the street-fighting and whither they wended and whatever became of them I did not know and never learned
BTS The day was like all the days
BTS I displayed it openly during our conversation but he took no notice of it
BTS Then there came a time when the grey cub no longer saw his father appearing and disappearing in the wall nor lying down asleep in the entrance
BTS Through the forest they crept noiselessly Buck at the hairy man's heels
BTS Oh many a Cup of this forbidden Wine Must drown the memory of that insolence
BTS This puzzled him
BTS And he read rightly and he read well
BTS ' It is a question not of grammar but of ethics I answered
BTS Not so with Collie
BTS Cry after cry and answering cries were turning the silence into a bedlam
BTS The Ghost is considered the fastest schooner in both the San Francisco and Victoria fleets
BTS He had never seen a dog go mad nor did he have any reason to fear madness
BTS I drove the little herd a dozen strong now what of the escapes she had permitted a hundred yards farther on
BTS In the files of the OUTLOOK a critical weekly of the period in the number dated August 18 1906 is related the circumstance of a workingman losing his arm the details of which are quite similar to those of Jackson's case as related by Avis Everhard
BTS Hello below
BTS He spoke enthusiastically with the love for a fine craft such as some men feel for horses
BTS That would settle it
BTS This I discovered when she nearly fell into the bunk during a sudden lurch of the schooner
BTS The noblest metaphysician of them all Ernest laughed
BTS Yet he knew that it was not permitted him to pursue and drag them down
BTS I'm just finishing the finishing touches
BTS I love you
BTS I raised a shout and she ran down to see
BTS We elect to be absurd and to return to the truly crude and wasteful methods of our forefathers
BTS But though he worked in the sled in the day White Fang did not forego the guarding of his master's property in the night
BTS Spitz was the leader likewise experienced and while he could not always get at Buck he growled sharp reproof now and again or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk Buck into the way he should go
BTS he never did more than turn his dull eyes upon the man then drop his head back to its customary position on his fore-paws
BTS Our boats hunted across the two or three miles of water between them and the point where the Macedonia's had been dropped and then headed for home
BTS Thirty-five sir
BTS Buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of murmured oaths and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy
BTS He relighted his cigar and glanced around
BTS It was for all the world like a wave tossed up by the sea
BTS Old memories were coming upon him fast and he was stirring to them as of old he stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows
BTS Each day they worked earned them thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets and they worked every day
BTS But the quick eye of Wolf Larsen caught him
BTS He whittled and listened gave monosyllabic replies and when it was asked terse advice
BTS I began to tremble
BTS maid wife or widow
BTS I queried
BTS We were well dressed and that was enough
BTS Trotting along in his silent way to investigate a new tepee which had been erected on the edge of the village while he was away with the hunters after moose he came full upon Kiche
BTS But in the moment he looked at Lip-lip his hair rose on end all along his back
BTS Then he cast an anxious look about him and said Because I've a good wife an' three of the sweetest children ye ever laid eyes on that's why
BTS Don't be a glutton Humphrey Maud chided me
BTS In the summer when there is a rush order I work from five in the morning to nine at night
BTS Wolf Larsen asked
BTS But I have yet to stamp upon others with them
BTS His world was very small
BTS Buck was raging
BTS The change in our fortunes had hastened my marriage and it was as a wife that I came to live in the four rooms on Pell Street in the San Francisco slum
BTS Why it would be rank ridiculousness for me to take that dog along he broke out after another pause
BTS But in this matter there was a difference and many differences
BTS He it was I know that carried some of Johnson's hasty talk to Wolf Larsen
BTS I want to get some sleep
BTS As the schooner paid off the fore- and main-sheets were slacked away for fair wind
BTS I asked
BTS Pivoting on his hind legs and snapping and gashing he was everywhere at once presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did he whirl and guard from side to side
BTS Not a word was spoken
BTS He suddenly thrust his head forward and nudged his way in between the master's arm and body
BTS There was no warmth no sign of fire
BTS And even while I was oppressed by the enormity of my sin for sin it was I chuckled with an insane delight
BTS Wickson said with slow deliberation
BTS Despite their changed and favorable conditions their hatred for the master class had not died
BTS The Bishop shook his head
BTS Kiche looked on anxiously
BTS He stood upon his right to go his way unmolested and to give trail to no dog
BTS All would be well
BTS At first speech in French is self-conscious a matter of the will
BTS It's a rookery the kind of a thing I've hunted for years
BTS And if the Plutocracy gets you first why it's only a matter of time when the Proletariat gets the Plutocracy
BTS This continued but every time the hand lifted the hair lifted under it
BTS They saw him with the eyes of their ancestors and by their inherited memory they knew White Fang for the wolf and they remembered the ancient feud
BTS all of them
BTS You have not yet picked out the flaw in my definition of philosophy
BTS If he persisted in the truth as he saw it he was doomed to an insane ward
BTS And then the wheel would reappear and Wolf Larsen's broad shoulders his hands gripping the spokes and holding the schooner to the course of his will himself an earth-god dominating the storm flinging its descending waters from him and riding it to his own ends
BTS Nor is that all
BTS He caught sight of White Fang and terror rushed into his face
BTS Here in Sierra Vista which was the name of Judge Scott's place White Fang quickly began to make himself at home
BTS It was the colossal bulk of them that impressed him
BTS It was in the debate on the bill to assist the unemployed
BTS I should have known the opportunity but it never came
BTS And that was all
BTS Look
BTS I'm not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he's around Pete announced conclusively nodding his head toward Buck
BTS He was standing in the companion-way only his head and shoulders visible staring straight at me
BTS It was not a pleasant face to look upon
BTS Again the Ghost sprang away and raced before the wind and for two hours Johnson and Leach pursued us
BTS They went into farm mortgages
BTS For that matter though not amative to any considerable degree so far as I have discovered I was never outside the atmosphere of women until now
BTS Wolf Larsen commanded the very second we had finished with the boat
BTS I felt that I was being torn to pieces
BTS You have been very wordy and all you have done is buzz
BTS Since it was to be done let it be done with despatch
BTS A man who leaves his money lying around the way you did deserves to lose it
BTS Only there is a hitch
BTS It was a rookery which had never been raided by the hunters and in consequence the seals were mild-tempered and at the same time unafraid
BTS Middle class 8429845
BTS but nevertheless a shame rises within me at the recollection and in the pride of my manhood I feel that my manhood has in unaccountable ways been smirched and sullied
BTS Mugridge's face turned white under its sooty veneer and when Wolf Larsen called for a rope and a couple of men the miserable Cockney fled wildly out of the galley and dodged and ducked about the deck with the grinning crew in pursuit
BTS They had travelled little more than a hundred yards when Henry who was in front bent down and picked up something with which his snowshoe had collided
BTS Of all persons in occupations seventy per cent come from the proletariat
BTS At first I could not understand
BTS I knew nothing of the minutiae of ropes and rigging of the trimming and setting of sails
BTS As the moose were coming into the land other kinds of life were coming in
BTS The thong grew taut
BTS One and all from time to time they felt his teeth
BTS It seemed monstrous impossible that our whole society was based upon blood
BTS But under it all they were men penetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence puny adventurers bent on colossal adventure pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and pulseless as the abysses of space
BTS Jibing the fore- and main-sails and setting the topsails again we headed back into the bank
BTS Ernest sprang out
BTS Wolf Larsen was my captain Thomas Mugridge and the rest were my companions and I was receiving repeated impresses from the die which had stamped them all
BTS There
BTS Weedon Scott debated with himself for a while and then said more gently You are right Matt
BTS Them animals is damn hungry an' once they start in they'll sure get you Bill
BTS They tried to lead the conversation away into easier channels
BTS A second cry arose piercing the silence with needle-like shrillness
BTS Then the Trust began to squeeze us out
BTS He came to know that it was not fear of him that drove the thief away but fear of Grey Beaver
BTS But these things had not been so
BTS This occurred with great frequency for once in full cry the dogs were prone to forget themselves in the excitement of the chase while White Fang never forgot himself
BTS Though stoutly mittened my fingers were cold and they pained from the grip on the steering-oar
BTS Do you know what they do to poor men in the States who like you do not work for their living
BTS They knew which side their bread was buttered on
BTS And not for nothing had he learned to walk softly when superior strength went by
BTS I asked
BTS Later on in the fall of the year he saved John Thornton's life in quite another fashion
BTS As a critic I was compelled to place you
BTS She shook her head with mock ruefulness
BTS Maud looked despair but I laughed and said it would do just as well
BTS It's not the nature of life to be otherwise
BTS She made some idle remark looking at me and laughed lightly enough
BTS Look again
BTS Neither buying nor selling they had no money and in the end their land was sold to pay the taxes
BTS For the time fear had been routed by growth while growth had assumed the guise of curiosity
BTS Again I turned my face to leeward and again I saw the jutting promontory black and high and naked the raging surf that broke about its base and beat its front high up with spouting fountains the black and forbidden coast-line running toward the south-east and fringed with a tremendous scarf of white
BTS Too much 'Frisco tanglefoot for the health of my crew
BTS It works
BTS It would be all up he answered
BTS he proclaimed
BTS It was stupid of me I know
BTS His tongue had tricked him
BTS This is a mistake
BTS The men addressed each other as Hal and Charles
BTS It was none of their business
BTS I felt myself masculine the protector of the weak the fighting male
BTS Thus do we poor humans attain our ends striving through carnage and destruction to bring lasting peace and happiness upon the earth
BTS second to surprise it and knock it off its feet
BTS Her head appeared under the flap of the sail
BTS Wickson went on coldly and dispassionately
BTS and by the time this part of my task was accomplished the Ghost was leaping into the south-west the wind on her quarter and all her sheets to starboard
BTS The vessels came together before I could follow his advice
BTS The muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into the blinding day the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud
BTS By the way do you believe in the immortal soul
BTS There had never been any labor troubles there
BTS Not a match did I bring
BTS What d'ye mean by that
BTS When the signal was given from every refuge all over the land and from the cities and towns and barracks devoted comrades were to go forth and blow up the wireless stations
BTS Then Jim Hall went to his living death
BTS Men were weak I say and because of their weakness we were compelled to make the only other reward that was within our power
BTS I may be taken off by some passing vessel perhaps she suggested
BTS It was patent that this terrible man was no ignorant clod such as one would inevitably suppose him to be from his exhibitions of brutality
BTS In the first day or so he saw more of them than he had seen Indians in all his life
BTS This was too much for White Fang
BTS Ahem we'll discuss that later he smiled as a bullet struck solidly into the cabin wall
BTS but the difference in their height was too great
BTS Then where could they possibly be
BTS Between us and the bottom of the sea was less than an inch of wood
BTS And of all unwarranted things
BTS Maud made fast and returned to the windlass
BTS Henry looked about with great carefulness and shook his head
BTS the third day forty miles which brought them well up toward the Five Fingers
BTS The dog-musher swore softly in awe-stricken accents
BTS There was puzzlement in his voice
BTS The troops we had fallen in with had held it back on the west
BTS And Hartman was right
BTS My brother told me about it when I was a little girl
BTS but when they took their seats in the spring of 1913 they found themselves without power of any sort
BTS But while he eyed the approaching hand he at the same time contrived to keep track of the club in the other hand suspended threateningly above him
BTS piping hot
BTS I saw the other one run off across the snow Bill announced with cool positiveness
BTS It was the summer of 1898 and thousands of gold-hunters were going up the Yukon to Dawson and the Klondike
BTS The automobiles on which they were mounted blocked the street compelling the soldiers to find positions in between and on the sidewalks
BTS I remembered the life-preservers stored in the cabin but was met at the door and swept backward by a wild rush of men and women
BTS He plunged into the forest and followed the river bank down the stream
BTS The loneliness of the man is slowly being borne in upon me
BTS Leach had worked himself into an ecstasy of impotent rage
BTS All right I'm willin' Matt agreed leaning the rifle against the woodpile
BTS Its flight was lame
BTS And now at this late date nothing remains but for the affair to take its place among the mysteries of history
BTS Won't you
BTS Sometimes he overstepped and stubbed his nose
BTS They were savages all of them who knew no law but the law of club and fang
BTS Maud interrupted
BTS Therefore was the father of Kiche a wolf
BTS But such fights were of brief duration
BTS Hello Hump he greeted me genially
BTS The unrest spread
BTS Calvin joined in the laugh against himself
BTS In the afternoon while the cook was below asleep and I was peeling the everlasting potatoes Louis dropped into the galley for a yarn
BTS It was the long wolf-howl full-throated and mournful the first howl he had ever uttered
BTS I can do what other men have done and I know that other men have clubbed seals
BTS It's no square Wolf Larsen said
BTS But with the master the cuff was always too light to hurt the flesh
BTS It was Henderson's boat and with him had been lost Holyoak and Williams another of the deep-water crowd
BTS He was abject before Wolf Larsen and almost grovelled to Johansen
BTS Sir
BTS And then the cub saw his mother the she-wolf the fearless one crouching down till her belly touched the ground whimpering wagging her tail making peace signs
BTS He no longer sprawled and straddled and already he was developing the gait of his mother slinking and furtive apparently without exertion yet sliding along with a swiftness that was as deceptive as it was imperceptible
BTS He's my old man
BTS In truth I was no longer the fine gentleman with a skin soft as a lydy's but only an ordinary and very worthless cabin-boy
BTS An' there's Smoke the black little devil didn't the Roosians have him for three years in the salt mines of Siberia for poachin' on Copper Island which is a Roosian preserve
BTS In the meantime Bill had bethought himself of the rifle
BTS He did not even appear on deck
BTS She'll be there in five or six hours with this wind
BTS For the Preacher loved life and did not want to die saying For a living dog is better than a dead lion
BTS I reckon it's up to me to kill 'm as I said I'd do
BTS He came back dragging a heavy sea-chest which he deposited on top of the trap
BTS The down-coming winter was harrying them on to the lower levels and it seemed they could never shake off this tireless creature that held them back
BTS He heard a shot then two shots in rapid succession and he knew that Bill's ammunition was gone
BTS They know their business better'n we do an' they ain't a-holdin' our trail this way for their health
BTS but he was the only unperturbed man aboard
BTS This was repeated a number of times
BTS The rasping scorching sands were a man's hard hands chafing my naked chest
BTS The master with his toe helped one sprawling puppy toward him
BTS You may die to-day this week or next month
BTS CHAPTER XXV THE TERRORISTS It was not until Ernest and I were back in New York and after weeks had elapsed that we were able to comprehend thoroughly the full sweep of the disaster that had befallen the Cause
BTS Hammerfield had been nearly killed in the Great Earthquake by a falling chimney
BTS It was my first descent into the forecastle and I shall not soon forget my impression of it caught as I stood on my feet at the bottom of the ladder
BTS The hard times of 1912 had already caused a frightful slump in the farm markets
BTS and father's happiness in our changed circumstances rounded out my own happiness
BTS It is true that we smaller capitalists are after profits and that the trusts are taking our profits away from us
BTS A man was quivering against my legs in a death-struggle
BTS for anything
BTS The bear has said that he will crush us
BTS for he had to make a living in addition to all his other labor
BTS I would call her and start
BTS I'll give you a thousand for him sir a thousand sir twelve hundred sir
BTS There is no Democratic Party
BTS The rabbit could not turn and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek
BTS I was aroused by a clod of earth striking at my feet
BTS I could see that she wavered
BTS No it is splendid and it is terrible too
BTS No more Spitz no more trouble sure
BTS But the cub was learning
BTS In the swamps and deserts and waste places from Florida to Alaska the small groups of Indians that survived were dancing ghost dances and waiting the coming of a Messiah of their own
BTS Some pitched the flies others cut firewood and pine boughs for the beds and still others carried water or ice for the cooks
BTS Weedon Scott reading the letter down in Circle City came upon the following That dam wolf won't work
BTS She sat crouched in the bottom of the boat her lips blue her face grey and plainly showing the pain she suffered
BTS It was old country to me that I knew and loved and soon I became the guide
BTS There was no place for her in his scheme of things as there was no place for him in hers
BTS Time and again he was cornered and the thing repeated though he was in poor condition or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him
BTS I cried five minutes later
BTS Van Weyden
BTS Likewise they advocated as a cure for local ills municipal ownership of such public utilities as water gas telephones and street railways
BTS Value of life
BTS but haply it may not be the change the bear anticipates
BTS But God has forsaken you small capitalists
BTS For a short three feet she was compelled to crouch then the walls widened and rose higher in a little round chamber nearly six feet in diameter
BTS He fired three careful shots
BTS Sauntering around the corner of the house in the early morning he came upon a chicken that had escaped from the chicken-yard
BTS I stepped out and advanced valiantly upon a long-maned bull in the midst of his wives
BTS That is why I cannot work in the shop
BTS And this out of all remains I made Ernest happy
BTS And the boy indicted Wolf Larsen as he had never been indicted before
BTS The sailors looked at me in consternation
BTS You must be very very careful of your health Cooky
BTS It's all right
BTS nothing remains but a bloody revolution of the working class
BTS You'll have to get a pry Matt counselled
BTS Then is it not irrational to destroy that cheap and efficient combination
BTS The roof barely cleared her head
BTS In all truth there in the labor-ghettos is the roaring abysmal beast the oligarchs fear so dreadfully--but it is the beast of their own making
BTS and thereat he was on his feet and raging his disappointment with tears in his eyes
BTS You make me all-fired tired
BTS Once again about and the Ghost headed out to open sea
BTS I wouldn't be s'prised to see it wag its tail
BTS It seemed to partake of her soul to have analogous attributes and to link it to life with the slenderest of chains
BTS Must be a tame wolf I reckon
BTS The boat had lowered its sail and run alongside
BTS Now and again he raised his head to note the dying down of the fire
BTS Not alone was he in the geographical Southland for he was in the Southland of life
BTS She found the pin with an adorable little cry and I turned my attention more fully to my steering
BTS Nothing was happening to them
BTS and the fifth turn about was taking a hand in the defence of its nearest mate
BTS Into the clearing where the moonlight streamed they poured in a silvery flood
BTS In all of which Ernest joined loyally and energetically though he could not forbear now and again from saying apropos of nothing in particular When it comes to powder chemical mixtures are better than mechanical mixtures you take my word
BTS That is the battle alignment
BTS There I disagree said the Bishop
BTS Here we had carried many loads of gravel from the creek-bed so that it was dry and warm a pleasant basking place
BTS Bah
BTS The wood was seasoned and dry and it was tied so closely to his neck that he could scarcely get his teeth to it
BTS But it is equally true that he then withdrew leaving the gang to receive the punishment of the outraged gods
BTS Possibly his success in capturing so many hunters and boats had counteracted the customary reaction
BTS So that at the end of five days we found ourselves short but four men Henderson Holyoak Williams and Kelly and were once more hunting on the flanks of the herd
BTS He was still breathing heavily from the exertion he had made
BTS he is too often sad
BTS in other words they were of no importance either for wealth or position or exceptional ability
BTS but he must have the advantage of every chance
BTS Again they fell to quoting and Maud gave Dowson's Impenitentia Ultima
BTS Life had a thousand faces and White Fang found he must meet them all thus when he went to town in to San Jose running behind the carriage or loafing about the streets when the carriage stopped
BTS He knew an overpowering desire for the protection and companionship of man
BTS This was certainly better than the life he had lived in the cage of Beauty Smith and it was necessary that he should have some god
BTS I felt rather timid and apprehensive for she had come to search Humphrey Van Weyden's soul and Humphrey Van Weyden had nothing of which to be particularly proud since his advent on the Ghost
BTS Under the capitalist regime these periods of hard times were as inevitable as they were absurd
BTS I had used eight shells for lighting fires before I hit upon the device of banking the embers with wet moss and there remained not over a hundred shells in the box
BTS These men wanted dogs and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs with strong muscles by which to toil and furry coats to protect them from the frost
BTS No was his answer
BTS Please don't she begged
BTS The difference between them was that the guard carried a bunch of keys and a revolver
BTS Hal guided at the gee-pole and Charles stumbled along in the rear
BTS For the possession of a flesh-and-blood god he exchanged his own liberty
BTS He even robbed Grey Beaver's snare of a rabbit at a time when Grey Beaver staggered and tottered through the forest sitting down often to rest what of weakness and of shortness of breath
BTS Don't you see
BTS The last growl could never be extracted from him
BTS The hunter golden bearded like a sea-king came over the rail and dropped on deck
BTS And in but a short while he had carried all the articles from the cache and lowered them down to me
BTS Her own terror rushed upon me and in that moment of fear the most terrible fear a man can experience I knew that in inexpressible ways she was dear to me
BTS It was a long ripping slash and deep as well
BTS He was a gloomy morose fellow and he showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone and further that there would be trouble if he were not left alone
BTS An unduly long summer would have been his thought had he thought about it
BTS That had given them an unfair advantage
BTS Nor has the worthlessness of the working class
BTS For some time the two men amused themselves with watching the movement of vague forms on the edge of the firelight
BTS To begin with at the midday dinner Wolf Larsen informed the hunters that they were to eat thenceforth in the steerage
BTS Both are apologists for the Oligarchy
BTS Again he yielded to the tying of a thong around his neck by Grey Beaver and again Beauty Smith came to claim him
BTS Oh shet up your croakin'
BTS Hand-clapping and pleased cries from the gods greeted the performance
BTS But father was nothing if not a scientist
BTS Men gasped and began to breathe again unaware that for a moment they had ceased to breathe
BTS At first he had known surprise
BTS The Trust was in control
BTS Also the great machinist strike had been broken
BTS He waited
BTS PART II CHAPTER I THE BATTLE OF THE FANGS It was the she-wolf who had first caught the sound of men's voices and the whining of the sled-dogs
BTS Some dam day heem keel dat Buck
BTS But even as he reached and before his fingers had closed on the missile she sprang back into safety
BTS I wisht we was pullin' into McGurry right now he began again
BTS but I found that I was now looking on it for the first time
BTS This was the moment of danger
BTS He sat by John Thornton's fire a broad-breasted dog white-fanged and long-furred
BTS I see
BTS I set the sail laid one tack out of the cove and on the other tack made our own little inner cove
BTS And so fresh from the soft southern world these dogs trotting down the gang-plank and out upon the Yukon shore had but to see White Fang to experience the irresistible impulse to rush upon him and destroy him
BTS Where were we to begin
BTS Here Collie
BTS There one day closing a cab he encountered Mr
BTS Everhard was right in the essential particulars though his date of the introduction of the bill is in error
BTS They were being tried for high treason and their places were taken by the creatures of the Iron Heel
BTS But your strength is detachable
BTS He is certainly an individualist of the most pronounced type
BTS I was stiff and lame and cried out with pain when the bed-clothes touched my poor finger-ends
BTS Sometimes Mercedes sided with her husband sometimes with her brother
BTS The only discussion--and that arose afterward--was when we should be married
BTS White Fang had already scented it
BTS There never was a time when there wasn't trouble when you and that brother of yours got together and I'll lay twenty to one on that
BTS It seemed rather a frank and open countenance which frankness or openness was enhanced by the fact that he was smooth-shaven
BTS A Russian could mean but one thing a cruiser
BTS And furthermore he himself was free
BTS The fingers could not close on it
BTS He did not question it nor puzzle over it
BTS Also he appreciated the power with which they administered the law
BTS Calvin shook a troubled head
BTS England was destined shortly to lose India while behind that event loomed the struggle between a united Asia and the world
BTS White Fang crouched down and backed away bristling showing his fangs his eyes malignant with menace
BTS One moonlight night running through the quiet forest One Eye suddenly halted
BTS Everything now went smoothly
BTS But Mugridge had little stomach for a dip in it
BTS And since he had not taken him with him before so now he could look to be left behind
BTS The metaphysician reasons from theory to facts the scientist reasons from facts to theory
BTS I had seen whisky drunk such as whisky-and-soda by the men of the clubs but never as these men drank it from pannikins and mugs and from the bottles great brimming drinks each one of which was in itself a debauch
BTS The facts of life took on a fiercer aspect
BTS Everywhere institutions and governments were crashing
BTS I laughed incredulously
BTS Why do you not call your soldiers in Mr
BTS Because I am a bigger bit of the ferment than you
BTS By that last statement you have given me back my premise
BTS But don't you care to escape as well as we
BTS Two were members of the Fighting Groups and the third Grace Holbrook entered a group the following year and six months later was executed by the Iron Heel
BTS The capitalist system will fall to pieces
BTS CHAPTER XIV THE BEGINNING OF THE END As early as January 1913 Ernest saw the true trend of affairs but he could not get his brother leaders to see the vision of the Iron Heel that had arisen in his brain
BTS Such high souls are made for crucifixion
BTS You see the masters are quite sure that they are right in what they are doing
BTS We say that the class struggle is a law of social development
BTS Only Spitz quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth snarling with horrible menace as though to frighten off impending death
BTS The other men came up and surrounded her and felt her and pawed her which actions she made no attempt to resent
BTS They had been for several weeks very turbulent and sullen and for that reason had been kept in camp
BTS Love alone is stronger than sin--stronger than death
BTS Wolf Larsen put thumb and forefinger to the wrist and counted the pulse
BTS From pavement to pavement and covering the sidewalks it lay there spread out quite evenly with only here and there a lump or mound of bodies to break the surface
BTS and so through the generations clients and lawyers pursued the illusion
BTS And I bent my head and kissed her hair softly so softly that she did not know
BTS And I could see their wan white hands from which the blood had been pressed at work upon the cloth out of which had been made my gown
BTS O'Brien contended it was Thornton's privilege to knock the runners loose leaving Buck to break it out from a dead standstill
BTS She let out a shrill shriek and bore in upon us
BTS You are  She was now staring at me in wide-eyed wonder
BTS Denied their usual food-supply weakened by hunger they fell upon and devoured one another
BTS I tell you we are on the verge of the unknown he insisted
BTS You are in the midst of a transition stage now in economic evolution but you do not understand it and that's what causes all the confusion
BTS The stick's as clean as a whistle
BTS It seemed incredible that the next surge should not crush the Ghost down upon the tiny eggshell
BTS I remembered hazily the physics of my school days while the last few months had given me practical experience with mechanical purchases
BTS Without moving and being part of the yeast there would be no hopelessness
BTS White Fang looked on at first
BTS Most savage of all was the Japanese Oligarchy that arose
BTS In this time of misery White Fang too stole away into the woods
BTS Often the streets were blocked by mountains of debris that compelled us to go around
BTS Wolf Larsen put the wheel hard up to port and we began to pay off
BTS Bring on your tainted money was the expressed sentiment of the Church during this period
BTS Are you in pain
BTS 'Tis not what I mean but what the Wolf 'll mean
BTS Could it be that our eyes were speaking beyond the will of our speech
BTS This portion was composed of the non-killers and the small killers
BTS For now the dogs hated him hated him for the extra meat bestowed upon him by Mit-sah
BTS By the very nature of the socialist state the German population would consume all that it produced
BTS He did not steal for joy of it but because of the clamor of his stomach
BTS Once Maud screamed in terror as a cow thrust an inquisitive nose toward her foot and several times I quickened my pace for the same reason
BTS Further he had no thousand dollars
BTS Later on in the galley I noticed that his ear was bruised and swollen
BTS It was the Wild still clinging to him asserting itself through him
BTS I prompted
BTS He had broken it
BTS Each saw the other
BTS He shrank down under it
BTS What do you think
BTS They looked upon him as legitimate prey and as legitimate prey he looked upon them
BTS and those that fled left two behind who would quarrel no more
BTS Of the steamer herself nothing was to be seen
BTS It was the divine flashing through us
BTS You know nothing and worse than nothing about the working class
BTS Instead of the great host the Mercenaries had hoped to gather together they succeeded in driving no more than forty thousand of the wretches into the lake
BTS He did not stand erect but with trunk inclined forward from the hips on legs that bent at the knees
BTS And for the space of several minutes he lay there quiet indulging his grotesque fancy
BTS What did it matter
BTS Not at all
BTS I never heard
BTS With them it was snap and slash and get away snap and slash and get away
BTS You may be a number one tip-top minin' expert all right all right the dog-musher delivered himself oracularly but you missed the chance of your life when you was a boy an' didn't run off an' join a circus
BTS She cried in general and she cried in particular over each discarded thing
BTS For that matter it was her presence which enabled Smoke to act as he did
BTS But the compensations of such religion are denied Wolf Larsen
BTS He manoeuvred for the final rush
BTS The water rushed into his lungs instead of the air that had always accompanied his act of breathing
BTS I beat out the burning remnants of straw in the bunk then made a dash for the deck for fresh air
BTS pooh
BTS It was its absolute simplicity that convinced even while one continued to doubt
BTS Ernest was madly impatient to be out in the world and doing for our ill-fated First Revolt that had miscarried in the Chicago Commune was ripening fast
BTS I shook my head
BTS It was evidently an affair of moment
BTS It has been truly said that a little learning is a dangerous thing and you have exemplified it to-night with your madcap theories
BTS The circle of flame and coals was breaking into segments with openings in between
BTS Here take a drink of this
BTS held its convention that night in San Francisco
BTS The day was a repetition of the days that had gone before
BTS He is clear up in the air
BTS Look at 'im run
BTS He watched the door for his antagonist to enter
BTS There is much good in us though you give us credit for no good at all
BTS He appeared the same physically as when last I saw him but he was gloomy and silent
BTS It did not fall
BTS Through the trees the mouth of the alley could be seen opening out on a moonlit glade
BTS What I don't know
BTS His face underwent a sudden change
BTS At such times her running mates flashed their teeth and growled threateningly across at each other
BTS Growl he would from the moment the petting began till it ended
BTS If he has destroyed the shears I shall do nothing except begin over again
BTS You must stand off from him Matthewson protested
BTS Their attitude toward him was so broadly tolerant and kindly that it was really patronizing
BTS He buckled down with a will and did his best though it was all new and strange
BTS Joe was snapping like a demon
BTS At two in the morning the boat's bow touched the beach of our own inner cove and I staggered out to make the painter fast
BTS Who threw the bomb we do not know but the one thing we are absolutely sure of is that we did not throw it
BTS Dead things did their bidding
BTS ' And then he turned and left me
BTS Numbers of the buildings held out over a week while one held out eleven days
BTS ' I looked at him triumphantly
BTS I have worked I do work I cried impetuously as though he were my judge and I required vindication and at the same time very much aware of my arrant idiocy in discussing the subject at all
BTS She shrugged her shoulders
BTS A certain deliberateness characterized his attitude
BTS At a bound Buck took up the duties of leadership
BTS She shook down her hair and it fell about her in a brown cloud hiding her face and shoulders
BTS But her coming to the table had something amusing in it
BTS Strike-breaking as an occupation will cease
BTS I leaned toward her
BTS Leach's rage was no longer impotent
BTS The Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal the like of which they had never seen before
BTS Fantastic as the situation was a land-lubber second in command I was nevertheless carrying it off well
BTS My cursed imagination saw her beaten and mangled against the rocks and it was too terrible
BTS the prisons will be turned into hospitals and the criminal will disappear with his crime
BTS The next moment I knew not what was happening
BTS Wolf Larsen called up
BTS Pig
BTS The Bishop's views are just as perilous to society
BTS And yet the Trust produces milk more cheaply than could the independent dairymen
BTS A big jackrabbit crossed our path leaping swiftly and silently like a deer
BTS I remember later in the voyage seeing Kerfoot another of the hunters lose a finger by having it smashed to a jelly
BTS The Black Hundreds were reactionary mobs organized by the perishing Autocracy in the Russian Revolution
BTS It was a mad revolt
BTS Johansen do you know anything about navigation
BTS The ground had been bought outright and the house had been paid for when it was built
BTS At other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between his legs and slept
BTS He had left the cave and run down to the stream to drink
BTS He was bewildered by the tremendous and endless rush and movement of things
BTS He compelled them to an unremitting respect for him
BTS When I took the steering-oar I had first to unbend her cramped fingers
BTS The porcupine met his approach with a furious squealing and a clashing of its long teeth
BTS Then I compelled her to stand up and though she would have fallen had I not supported her I forced her to walk back and forth the several steps between the thwart and the stern-sheets and finally to spring up and down
BTS Feel them he commanded
BTS A lead keel of fabulous but unknown weight makes her very stable while she carries an immense spread of canvas
BTS It's unfortunate he continued
BTS Did you see them leading him so solicitously from the platform
BTS Do you know where you can get plenty of lead
BTS Scott
BTS Instead of crossing the street I hurried after the man
BTS It floated too low and was shot full of holes before it could reach the fortresses
BTS Bitter experiences these which perforce he swallowed calling upon all his wisdom to cope with them
BTS So long as you exist there is a vital need for hell-fire in the Cosmos
BTS The oars struck the water and with a few strokes the boat was alongside
BTS He said it was in poor taste utterly profitless anyway and not in harmony with university traditions and policy
BTS Every little while she emitted a low growl and at times when it seemed to her he approached too near the growl shot up in her throat to a sharp snarl
BTS I promise you
BTS CHAPTER I MY EAGLE The soft summer wind stirs the redwoods and Wild-Water ripples sweet cadences over its mossy stones
BTS My pocketbook is stuffed with the old coinage and it's a stubborn thing
BTS And when on the still cold nights he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and wolflike it was his ancestors dead and dust pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him
BTS Carlson afterward reported several blisters and much grievous loss of skin due to the smallness of the shoes but he succeeded in doing gallant work with them
BTS He was often called the greatest lawyer in the country--corporation lawyer of course
BTS In the meantime Harrison had started out on the halyards
BTS A soft light suffused his face and his eyes glistened as though somewhere in the deeps of his being his ancestors had quickened and stirred with dim memories of tips received in former lives
BTS He dozed despite himself crouching by the fire the blankets about his shoulders the axe between his knees and on either side a dog pressing close against him
BTS And so was recorded the second epitaph in two days
BTS I don't know I don't know Bill muttered ominously
BTS It was an accident
BTS I knew the kind so thick and so close of texture that it could resist the rain and not be soaked through after hours of wetting
BTS His hand was sweeping nervously across his face as though he were brushing away cobwebs
BTS It's burned badly
BTS She was as frightened as I at the prospect and we had reason to be gazing at close range at the gleaming teeth and dog-like mouths
BTS I reached my hand and felt for his
BTS whereupon he cried more hopelessly and helplessly than ever
BTS Your education is only half completed then he said dryly and turned to her
BTS Then came the day when through the open cabin door White Fang saw the fatal grip on the floor and the love-master packing things into it
BTS and father with his long and peaceful life was instanced as a shining example of how the bacillus of violence worked
BTS There is not enough work for the young
BTS I had learned of the device from the talk of the hunters and it was a simple thing to manufacture
BTS And no one interfered
BTS Humphrey Van Weyden the cold-blooded fish the emotionless monster the analytical demon of Charley Furuseth's christening in love
BTS Wolf Larsen regarded me with smiling eyes
BTS Calvin said stubbornly
BTS But his pursuers forestalling him he doubled back across the cabin passed over the galley and gained the deck by means of the steerage-scuttle
BTS They gave a multitude of excuses but not one house would consider the book
BTS He described his ambitions and ideals and his conception of the paradise wherein lived the people of the upper classes
BTS Charity begins at home
BTS Your stomachs are round with the plenitude of eating
BTS so he chose a new way to intimidate me
BTS He had been transferred from asylum to asylum
BTS He was surprised at the commonness of the clay
BTS there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked
BTS Thus White Fang was kept in training
BTS Matt rushed in but quicker than he was White Fang
BTS It was the Wild in him the fear of hurt and of the trap that had given rise to the panicky impulses to avoid contacts
BTS There on the beach not fifty feet away bow on dismasted was a black-hulled vessel
BTS I have demonstrated to you mathematically the inevitable breakdown of the capitalist system
BTS He bounded towards her joyously and she met him with shrewd fangs that laid his cheek open to the bone
BTS He nodded cheerfully
BTS Wickson--men worth a few millions who were adherents of the arch-oligarchs
BTS The old man wants you
BTS At sound of this the cry of Life plunging down from Life's apex in the grip of Death the fall pack at Buck's heels raised a hell's chorus of delight
BTS In the midst of your own profit-making along comes the trust and takes your profits away from you
BTS He tells me that the day we were rescued even while I was in the cabin two men were drowned deliberately drowned murdered
BTS White Fang had never been very demonstrative
BTS CHAPTER V THE SLEEPING WOLF It was about this time that the newspapers were full of the daring escape of a convict from San Quentin prison
BTS Often at night we rode over the mountains for exercise and we rode on Wickson's horses
BTS Matt concurred
BTS A squirrel running around the base of the trunk came full upon him and gave him a great fright
BTS She rested her hand appealingly on mine and sent my pulse fluttering
BTS And once declared against him they found good reason to continue declared against him
BTS I wished merely to prepare you for the worst if the worst is to come
BTS And I would go on deck beckon Louis to me and learn from him what was to be done
BTS The fortresses were crowded with Mercenaries the wind blew in the right direction and up went our balloons from one of the office buildings in the city
BTS And it is a sadness as deep-reaching as the roots of the race
BTS The sneer was wholly in his voice
BTS So run away he did violating his own nature and pride with every leap he made and leaping all day long
BTS Buck's restlessness came back on him and he was haunted by recollections of the wild brother and of the smiling land beyond the divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches
BTS There seemed a certain spice about it such as men must feel who take delight in making pets of ferocious animals
BTS It was about us veiling and hiding us in its dense wet gauze
BTS Never in his brief cave-life had he encountered anything of which to be afraid
BTS Seems to me Henry they're stayin' remarkable close to camp Bill commented
BTS An' after that she ate Bill
BTS The mental processes of the man with whom one disagrees are always wrong
BTS Comrade after comrade men and women failed in their attempts and were cruelly executed by the Oligarchy
BTS For some time she stood alone
BTS He aroused in them their instinctive fear of the Wild and they greeted him always with snarl and growl and belligerent hatred
BTS He came to know that men were more just children more cruel and women more kindly and more likely to toss him a bit of meat or bone
BTS Our only consolation is philosophic
BTS They went their ways with great haste and definiteness withal there was a curious indecision in their movements as though they expected the buildings to topple over on them or the sidewalks to sink under their feet or fly up in the air
BTS You have merely made a few excited and dogmatic assertions about my mental caliber
BTS It won't do you any good to repeat anything I've said
BTS There'll be more than smoke in my petards
BTS Because it was unknown it was hostile to him
BTS Never he swore had there been the like of this animal
BTS This time though we were continually half-buried there was no trough in which to be swept and we drifted squarely down upon the upturned boat badly smashing it as it was heaved inboard
BTS He told us much though he told us more of the joy he had experienced in doing the Master's bidding
BTS The whip was whistling savagely when once more Mercedes interfered
BTS So it was that the socialists succeeded in making Australia and New Zealand into cooperative commonwealths
BTS The sapling remained bent above him
BTS His face was blistering in the heat his eyebrows and lashes were singed off and the heat was becoming unbearable to his feet
BTS Thus the dog behind could never catch up with the one in front
BTS Grundy
BTS You make me sick
BTS It was between him and the master cutting him off
BTS Nay the trusts did more than stand firm
BTS It was an intolerable period of anxiety
BTS Gif it to heem by Gar
BTS He had been over this ground before when it was bare but now a village occupied it
BTS I had folded up the blankets but she now proceeded to spread them out on the bottom
BTS I could not agree with Ernest
BTS White Fang in the very nature of him could never know anything about gods
BTS he barked
BTS For the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason and it was because of his great love for John Thornton that he lost his head
BTS Are you  I began
BTS I felt myself slipping into unconsciousness and tried with all the power of my will to fight above the suffocating blankness and darkness that was rising around me
BTS Ernest was upon him like a flash
BTS Verbal contradictions called BULLS were long an amiable weakness of the ancient Irish
BTS I don't like the looks of it
BTS Symons's lines came into my head I wandered all these years among A world of women seeking you
BTS A moment later he was straying away again from his mother
BTS With a roar that was almost lionlike in its ferocity he again hurled himself at the man
BTS They must have a sanction for their acts
BTS And the Church ignored it
BTS Now he could expect a beating as fearful as any he had received from Beauty Smith
BTS Jerk open the doors Hump I was commanded
BTS was the dog-musher's expression of astonishment
BTS And is that all
BTS What have they done for mankind beyond the spinning of airy fancies and the mistaking of their own shadows for gods
BTS An' wasn't there the Governor of Kura Island an' the Chief iv Police Japanese gentlemen sir an' didn't they come aboard the Ghost as his guests a-bringin' their wives along wee an' pretty little bits of things like you see 'em painted on fans
BTS The suck of the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was frightful and Thornton knew that the shore was impossible
BTS I nodded my head and proceeded to make a flank attack on the nearest harem
BTS I could sail them better than make them and I had no doubt of my power to bring the schooner to some northern port of Japan
BTS He was transferred from one part of the country to another
BTS You'll both be proletarians before you're done with it
BTS What occurred in those intervals I know not and never shall know
BTS Then it was that Beauty Smith had talk with him again about the sale of White Fang
BTS They were his environment these men and they were moulding the clay of him into a more ferocious thing than had been intended by Nature
BTS If capital consumed its share the sum total of capital could not increase
BTS but let him become bored or let him have one of his black moods come upon him and at once I am relegated from cabin table to galley while at the same time I am fortunate to escape with my life and a whole body
BTS Good-bye Matt old man
BTS Also it very frequently got out special editions of from two to five millions
BTS In an insane fit of jealousy he killed his wife--a very common act in those times
BTS I was conscious only of an overmastering rage
BTS We shall survive and we shall overthrow the trusts
BTS Wolf Larsen had procured a rifle and was throwing a cartridge into the barrel
BTS The old girl knows how to walk
BTS Continually changing its intensity and abruptly variant in pitch it impinged on his nerves and senses made him nervous and restless and worried him with a perpetual imminence of happening
BTS They were truly representative middle-class business men
BTS Satisfied with the honesty of his and the Kanaka's sleep Wolf Larsen passed on to the next two bunks on the starboard side occupied top and bottom as we saw in the light of the sea-lamp by Leach and Johnson
BTS The Ghost blanketed it
BTS But ever her eyes looked bravely at me and ever her lips uttered brave words
BTS Beauty Smith started
BTS Maud was only faint and dizzy and I left her lying on the deck when I took my second plunge below
BTS The wind balked my every effort ripping the canvas out of my hands and in an instant undoing what I had gained by ten minutes of severest struggle
BTS He kept it in his hand and steadfastly proffered it
BTS But there were many police and watchmen in evidence and now and again automobile patrols of the Mercenaries slipped swiftly past
BTS In the juggling of events such a war would cause in the reshuffling of the international cards and the making of new treaties and alliances the Oligarchy had much to gain
BTS He did not know what to do it was all so unprecedented
BTS But those terrible hands of his
BTS The mob's coming back
BTS I tried to cry out but was too exhausted
BTS Maybe he is in Chicago now and all is well
BTS Intellectually they were children inhabiting the physical forms of men
BTS And thereafter in the orgy of horror that raged through the succeeding hours I was able to take a calm interest
BTS We ran past our line of boats and bore down upon the first weather boat of the other line
BTS Blows were raining upon him from all sides
BTS Wolf Larsen at once squared away and ran down along the rim of the fog-bank
BTS He talked to White Fang as White Fang had never been talked to before
BTS CHAPTER V THE COVENANT When December was well along Grey Beaver went on a journey up the Mackenzie
BTS It ran up the tree and from a point of safety chattered back savagely
BTS Unfortunately when running free it is impossible to lash the wheel so I faced an all-night watch
BTS It will make a sensation I asserted
BTS The stiff breeze and heavy sea which had sprung up the previous afternoon had been moderating all morning so that it was now possible to lower the boats for an afternoon's hunt
BTS How distinctly do I remember his poor pitiful gnarled hands as he lay there on the pavement--hands that were more hoof and claw than hands all twisted and distorted by the toil of all his days with on the palms a horny growth of callous a half inch thick
BTS The oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him
BTS but what a pony is I don't know
BTS He took no notice of me
BTS Behind law must be force to execute the law
BTS From Spitzbergen through the Arctic and across Canada and the Barrens he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them
BTS By the time Cassiar Bar was reached he was so weak that he was falling repeatedly in the traces
BTS Several days more passed before Johnson crawled on deck and went about his work in a half-hearted way
BTS He stole a glance upward
BTS There were swift commands on deck a stamping of feet and a slapping of reef-points as the Ghost shot into the wind and about on the other tack
BTS He never wasted his strength never tussled
BTS What does that mean
BTS and while he disliked it in the learning of it unknown to himself he was learning to like it
BTS We looked at each other in consternation
BTS His resignation was demanded that was all
BTS He swept his arm in an impatient gesture toward a number of the sailors who were working on some kind of rope stuff amidships
BTS While my hope and faith in human life still survived Wolf Larsen's destructive criticism he had nevertheless been a cause of change in minor matters
BTS She seemed to be searching for something that she could not find
BTS I can shoot you now as I stand here
BTS CHAPTER XIII THE GENERAL STRIKE Of course Ernest was elected to Congress in the great socialist landslide that took place in the fall of 1912
BTS His neck was the neck of a prize-fighter thick and strong
BTS What are you then
BTS Bread and butter silks and jewels dollars and cents and incidentally the closing up of the overland trade-routes to India were the things that caused the voyages of discovery
BTS I was learning fast but I learned not fast enough to realize then the peril of our position
BTS Louis tells me that the gossip of the sailors finds its way aft and that two of the telltales have been badly beaten by their mates
BTS Judge Scott commanded
BTS When it reared the master put the spurs to it and made it drop its fore-legs back to earth whereupon it would begin kicking with its hind-legs
BTS The inner doors to the entrance were locked and bolted
BTS Are you all agreed so far
BTS though the gigantic caldron continued to bubble in the distance dull roars of explosions came to us from all directions and the smoke-pillars were towering more ominously in the heavens
BTS It is well known that he toiled hard for liberty and suffered sore
BTS Humphrey
BTS They have only to see us
BTS Francois followed him up whereupon he again retreated
BTS He had shown signs of consciousness and she had spoken to him eliciting no response
BTS White Fang followed and lay down beside her
BTS I felt a wilting sensation a sinking at the heart and I might just as well say a giddiness
BTS White Fang seeming to sum up strength in all his qualities nevertheless suffered from one besetting weakness
BTS Then it so happens that I am behaving differently for my purse and my soul have both been touched
BTS He came in among them panting covered with dust
BTS Yet the command to the Church was 'Feed my lambs' Ernest sneered
BTS Spitz was a practised fighter
BTS and in this he was encouraged and trained by Grey Beaver
BTS he asked seriously
BTS No mention there of class hatred he smiled back
BTS Henry called
BTS Yonson I said
BTS ' His face turned red and he was so confused that he forgot to tip me
BTS Whenever we approached such localities the guards turned us back and sent us around
BTS He stamped them into the snow under him in the wallowing struggle
BTS He was fighting grimly and silently for life
BTS As I say while I appreciated the power of the terrific denunciation that swept out of Wolf Larsen's mouth I was inexpressibly shocked
BTS Having cast off the lashings I hoisted first on the forward tackle then on the aft till the boat cleared the rail when I lowered away one tackle and then the other for a couple of feet till it hung snugly above the water against the schooner's side
BTS And he had done nothing but put his hand upon my arm and squeeze
BTS Lend me a hand
BTS He could not encounter that howling horde with his tail and hind-quarters
BTS But these wills were always broken and very often by the very lawyers that had drawn them up
BTS In consequence the strange dogs he encountered had no chance against him
BTS But you have the concrete wealth twenty-four billions of it and the Plutocracy will take it away from you
BTS I hope my face does not appear angry I answered seriously
BTS This pamphlet had a small circulation among workingmen
BTS Oh as a revolutionist I have about eight chances to the workingman's one of being injured or killed he answered carelessly
BTS He was bearded and gaunt and dirty but I succeeded in remembering him as the stalwart youth that had spent several months in our Glen Ellen refuge three years before
BTS Though the Bishop was warm the poor swollen hands of the old woman were already cramping with the cold
BTS said John Thornton
BTS White Fang stood before him growling fiercely
BTS He bristled fiercely and looked ominously across the shin-bone at White Fang
BTS While he was struggling to his feet the young dog sank teeth twice into his shoulder
BTS Whenever they propagate ideas that menace the Plutocracy they lose their jobs in which case if they have not provided for the rainy day they descend into the proletariat and either perish or become working-class agitators
BTS Whereupon he sat up and ki-yi'd louder than ever
BTS Not an Irish name the captain snapped sharply
BTS The sled was upside down and jammed between a tree-trunk and a huge rock and they were forced to unharness the dogs in order to straighten out the tangle
BTS I told you it was hopeless Matt Scott said in a discouraged voice
BTS His mate looked at him anxiously
BTS Charles demanded rather shortly
BTS They were greatly excited and made many noises with their mouths
BTS What do you say to a cup of coffee
BTS He cooked breakfast in the darkness and at nine o'clock when with the coming of daylight the wolf-pack drew back he set about the task he had planned through the long hours of the night
BTS The next instant he was on his feet but in that instant Cherokee's teeth closed on his throat
BTS He fed the dogs cooked and ate his supper and made his bed close to the fire
BTS Dawn was breaking through the windows and dimming the electric lights
BTS Why couldn't one of you just one of you get me a knife when I sung out
BTS CHAPTER XXXVIII I think my left side is going Wolf Larsen wrote the morning after his attempt to fire the ship
BTS By some freak of pressures his frail body had snapped the strong man's leg like a pipe-stem
BTS He opened it and began to read 'Section One be it enacted and so forth and so forth that the militia shall consist of every able-bodied male citizen of the respective states territories and District of Columbia who is more than eighteen and less than forty-five years of age
BTS He picked it up in his mouth
BTS Yes Beauty Smith grunted shrinking away
BTS Thornton was running behind encouraging Buck with short cheery words
BTS and the dead man dying obscenely buried sordidly and sinking down down  Then it was that the cruelty of the sea its relentlessness and awfulness rushed upon me
BTS And through it all Buck staggered along at the head of the team as in a nightmare
BTS Burton and O'Sullivan were in it
BTS She is asleep
BTS Not quite entirely had the porcupine unrolled when it discovered its enemy
BTS Embittered by his fate brooding over his wrongs he became an anarchist--not a philosophic anarchist but a mere animal mad with hate and lust for revenge
BTS Flinging his brands at the nearest of his enemies the man thrust his smouldering mittens into the snow and stamped about to cool his feet
BTS There were many signs of the battle that had been fought and of the lynx's withdrawal to her lair after having won the victory
BTS I can't keep his feet on the earth
BTS PART III CHAPTER I THE MAKERS OF FIRE The cub came upon it suddenly
BTS It flowed along smoothly and neither fear nor foe lurked by the way
BTS And ever out of the north-east the brave wind blows driving us on our course two hundred and fifty miles between the dawns
BTS He can gnaw through leather as clean as a knife an' jes' about half as quick
BTS You can't expect 'm to come out a white an' shinin' angel
BTS It was surely dead
BTS I remember once on deck in bright day touching him on the shoulder as preliminary to giving an order
BTS There was nothing for the dogs to do save the hauling in of meat now and again that Thornton killed and Buck spent long hours musing by the fire
BTS You
BTS We will say for the sake of round figures that the total production of wealth in the United States is one year is four billion dollars
BTS But why stronger
BTS I had had no responsibilities at all
BTS She did not snap nor threaten to snap
BTS He is greatly disgusted with the outlook and I am given to understand that Wolf Larsen bears a very unsavoury reputation among the sealing captains
BTS His was a better far better nervous mental and muscular co-ordination
BTS He was regarded as the most fearful of wild beasts and this was borne in to him through the bars of the cage
BTS He greeted me with one of his whimsical smiles
BTS The master rode alone that day
BTS Cold and cheerless the wind beating on our faces the white seas roaring by we struggled through the day
BTS The palaces of the Church should be hospitals and nurseries for those who have fallen by the wayside and are perishing
BTS Our courses were converging like the sides of an angle the vertex of which was at the edge of the fog-bank
BTS What d'ye say
BTS To-day we know better but our knowledge does not overcome the fact that Ghent remains the most abused innocent man in all history
BTS He clung on for a moment long enough to drag the god over backward
BTS And I was not strong
BTS Opened up top and bottom like a sieve
BTS For two reasons Ernest said
BTS You will be discharged was the warning
BTS It was he who snarled warningly at the younger members of the pack or slashed at them with his fangs when they ambitiously tried to pass him
BTS They are no good sir
BTS White Fang still wrought up and bristling growled and growled the hair slowly lying down the crooning note remote and dim but growing in his throat
BTS There was a smack of success in her words
BTS Values were pitifully and inconceivably shrunken and the trusts added hugely to their holdings even extending their enterprises into many new fields--and always at the expense of the middle class
BTS so don't let that hinder you
BTS He does not lose anything for with the loss of himself he loses the knowledge of loss
BTS At the first hint of conflict the whole team drew together and faced him
BTS All were quiet and subdued and leave-taking was done with low voices
BTS you are
BTS Round and round and back again stumbling and falling and rising even uprearing at times on his hind-legs and lifting his foe clear of the earth he struggled vainly to shake off the clinging death
BTS For a time each blow brought a yelp from him
BTS One thousand dollars if you take me ashore
BTS Lift up that end there damn you
BTS Besides it did not seem to him that it was intended he should fight with the dog he saw before him
BTS The hunters too are supposed to be in command of the watches subject always to the orders of Wolf Larsen
BTS Perhaps the jaw was too large
BTS The rest of the team however had grown unruly during the last days of Spitz and their surprise was great now that Buck proceeded to lick them into shape
BTS Then before him at his feet he saw an extremely small live thing only several inches long a young weasel that like himself had disobediently gone out adventuring
BTS The white fangs
BTS Colonel Van Gilbert was a great corporation lawyer
BTS His laughter jarred upon me
BTS Freedom to roam and run and lie down at will had been his heritage
BTS It was Spitz
BTS So were his brothers and sisters
BTS They had crept in while Buck and Spitz were fighting and when the two men sprang among them with stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back
BTS But when he challenged the truism I was speechless
BTS Wasn't I a-layin' on the Emma L
BTS This glimpse I had caught of his other side must have emboldened me for I resolved to speak to him about the money I had lost
BTS And when they take me out of Congress Ernest replied coldly and put me against a wall and blow my brains out--what then
BTS where are you
BTS I will always pay my dues and when the cooperative commonwealth comes I will be glad
BTS And again the doubt assailed me
BTS You call me a pessimist
BTS Then there was the campaign
BTS My man she said looking at me for an instant with tremulous lids which fluttered down and veiled her eyes as she snuggled her head against my breast with a happy little sigh
BTS Something had gone wrong with him
BTS Wolf Larsen nodded approval and relinquished the wheel to me
BTS I had already remarked that his language was excellent marred with an occasional slight inaccuracy
BTS He clutched its slippery top with both hands releasing Buck and above the roar of the churning water shouted Go Buck
BTS Yes you did father meditated
BTS Having instructed Thomas Mugridge as to what he was to do I clambered into the fore-rigging a few feet
BTS Wolf Larsen 'll do for me I know it
BTS She was thrilling to a desire that urged her to go forward to be in closer to that fire to be squabbling with the dogs and to be avoiding and dodging the stumbling feet of men
BTS The eyes themselves were of that baffling protean grey which is never twice the same
BTS Piece by piece he ate all the meat and nothing happened
BTS As Matt had pleaded for White Fang when he had been bitten it was now Weedon Scott's turn to plead
BTS It was Death's turn and it's all in the family anyway
BTS You have talked about other things and things concerning other things but you have not answered
BTS A snarl was the answer
BTS Henry laughed defiantly
BTS Keep back he warned me
BTS Throw away that tent and all those dishes who's going to wash them anyway
BTS He was master of the situation
BTS He had driven his teeth into the sacred flesh of one of them and could expect nothing but a most terrible punishment
BTS But I shall menace their money-bags
BTS Of all this White Fang knew nothing
BTS He straightened up in time to see a dim form disappearing across the snow into the shelter of the dark
BTS In both countries the socialists came out in bold declaration against the war and threatened the general strike
BTS By oligarchs and comrades on the inside who were high in authority place had been made for us we were in possession of all necessary documents and our pasts were accounted for
BTS Under the approaching smoke the hull and upper-works of a steamer were growing larger
BTS The only crime of Moyer and Haywood is that they have been unswervingly true to the working class
BTS During that period I used to marvel at my own metamorphosis
BTS I've lost one of my precious hair-pins
BTS I felt her mittened hand come out to mine
BTS The crowd was watching curiously
BTS Yet she steadfastly refused to marry
BTS Men and women devoted their lives to the Cause and new-born babes were sealed to it as of old they had been sealed to the service of God
BTS From him White Fang had learned much of his own insignificance
BTS I could never forgive myself
BTS He knows the secrets of a score of our refuges
BTS The nails were discoloured and black while the skin was already grained with dirt which even a scrubbing-brush could not remove
BTS Congressman Wiley in the brief discussion that was permitted said that the bill 'provided for a reserve force to take the mob by the throat'--you're the mob gentlemen--'and protect at all hazards life liberty and property
BTS This feeling had been accentuated by the Ishmaelite life he had led from his puppyhood
BTS White Fang knew why he was being beaten
BTS Cherokee was too squat too close to the ground
BTS While the revolutionists were wiped out the loss was not one-sided
BTS I discovered that for those ten years my gain was just equivalent to a manager's salary
BTS It was wanton slaughter and all for woman's sake
BTS His brain worked in dim ways
BTS He was so eminent a scientist that such an announcement coupled with the reason for his enforced resignation would have created somewhat of a furor all over the world
BTS For every man who betrayed us from one to a dozen faithful avengers were loosed upon his heels
BTS Sooner or later he would accomplish his purpose get the grip that would win the battle
BTS From the way he cut up the other time you went away I wouldn't wonder this time but what he died
BTS The flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists
BTS It was patent to everybody that the boy was afraid
BTS The Sunland was very dim and distant and such memories had no power over him
BTS Sheets were trimmed and Wolf Larsen proceeded to put the Ghost through her paces
BTS At last the gage of battle had been thrown down
BTS Some of the coal dust had coated his face and the sweat from his exertions was running in streaks
BTS and trust the oligarchs to find a way
BTS For no other reason did Hurlbert die under torture refusing to the last to betray his comrades
BTS Judge Scott's suggestion of a trained nurse was indignantly clamoured down by the girls who themselves undertook the task
BTS It was farm-bred and fat and tender
BTS For the last time he rushed
BTS But he was thrown down and choked repeatedly till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass collar from off his neck
BTS Henry made no reply and plodded on alone though often he cast anxious glances back into the grey solitude where his partner had disappeared
BTS His enemy was too big
BTS Even in death she seemed loath to part with that which had caused her death
BTS Louis gave a spoke and temporized
BTS Thomas Mugridge is a sneak a spy an informer
BTS Further she was unafraid of things
BTS The socialists used to foretell with joy he said the coming of the day when organized labor defeated on the industrial field would come over on to the political field
BTS They were half-brothers only they did not know it
BTS Yet we spend as freely as you was Maud Brewster's contribution
BTS He never left this cell
BTS He was battling like a giant and I did not guess it
BTS I have no experience
BTS But it's to trouble he'll come with Wolf Larsen as the sparks fly upward
BTS His reason was unseated by the blind yearning of the flesh to exist and move at all hazards to move to continue to move for movement was the expression of its existence
BTS I picked up a seal-club
BTS They're remarkable thin
BTS Besides I was myself aware of hurt at thought of this man whom I had tried to kill dying alone with his fellow-creatures so near
BTS His pale wishy-washy eyes were swimming like lazy summer seas though what blissful visions they beheld were beyond my imagination
BTS It was after Everhard's execution that his wife went to Wake Robin Lodge a small bungalow in the Sonoma Hills of California
BTS The Iron Heel is here
BTS In the morning we had breakfast and were at work by daylight
BTS If I tried to enter your father's house at night to steal his dividends from the Sierra Mills what would he do
BTS Kowalt
BTS It was remarkably calloused
BTS I met men incoherent with indignation at the brutality of prize-fighting and who at the same time were parties to the adulteration of food that killed each year more babes than even red-handed Herod had killed
BTS Furthermore there was no dog like him on the Mackenzie nor the Yukon
BTS You've found your legs with a vengeance
BTS How had it happened
BTS Kill me
BTS As usual his was the sheer materialistic side and Maud's was the idealistic
BTS So far as he was concerned they did not exist
BTS Men and women disappeared our nearest and dearest comrades
BTS The door opened and Weedon Scott stepped in
BTS One other adventure was destined for him that day
BTS It seems to me impossible sometimes that they ever had mothers
BTS Then Scott looked around the room
BTS There's that fake train in front of us
BTS But how comes it that you are here
BTS He is a lump of an animal without any head
BTS I queried
BTS White Fang began by ignoring him
BTS I asked
BTS It was not his way
BTS Quarter was neither given nor taken and in the fighting the revolutionists had the advantage of being above
BTS Everhard unpalatable though it has been
BTS I looked at the bleak inaccessible wall at my back and know the profundity of despair
BTS The same with a returning explorer from the polar regions or the latest literary or artistic success
BTS So he started out to look for the cave and his mother feeling at the same time an overwhelming rush of loneliness and helplessness
BTS I'm like the man from Texas he said
BTS And now I guess you can go away
BTS What was done
BTS Where are the mothers of these twenty and odd men on the Ghost
BTS Good dwellings modern and sanitary were built for them surrounded by spacious yards and separated here and there by parks and playgrounds
BTS Stand from under you Johansen
BTS It is like yeast a ferment a thing that moves and may move for a minute an hour a year or a hundred years but that in the end will cease to move
BTS She came close to me and shouted I'm dreadfully afraid
BTS He had done this thing before somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world and he was doing it again now running free in the open the unpacked earth underfoot the wide sky overhead
BTS All my work had been for nothing
BTS He walked for miles around knolls over ridges and through canyons and finally covered the trail in the running water of a creek-bed
BTS The laughter of men was a hateful thing
BTS And ships must visit the station
BTS White Fang tried the trick once too often
BTS Being a female she possessed no such instinct
BTS Father had been politely abused in the capitalist press the tone of the abuse being to the effect that it was a pity so great a scientist should leave his field and invade the realm of sociology about which he knew nothing and wherein he had promptly become lost
BTS In reality this was the act of classification
BTS Or if you will the sum of his desires is his soul
BTS The Ghost at the moment was uptossed on a sea and I caught a clear view of a small steamship two or three miles away rolling and pitching head on to the sea as it steamed toward us
BTS Didn't Lang include your Kiss Endured' among the four supreme sonnets by women in the English language
BTS He is helpless and frightened I imagine for the first time in his life
BTS A man's half licked when he says he is
BTS His strength left him and the last his mates saw of him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them
BTS The book is a good example of what Everhard would have called bourgeois thinking
BTS But it was Boats over
BTS My ribs kicked loose from my back again
BTS And you
BTS And that was really the situation
BTS He looked appealingly around the table but no one answered for him
BTS And mind you it's for your own soul's sake
BTS Hold on don't go yet
BTS Some time later as he was going aboard his steamer to sail to England he was approached by another reporter who wanted to know if he had changed his opinion of Chicago
BTS You have been blind and greedy
BTS Nevertheless one hundred and forty pounds to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion
BTS It was agitated by no tremor of anticipation
BTS It was not that kind of a club
BTS That means  she began
BTS He had the Bishop's experience to lesson from and he lessoned well
BTS It would remain constant
BTS Inside this circle he crouched his sleeping outfit under him as a protection against the melting snow
BTS It was not until the Second Revolt was crushed that the 'Frisco Reds flourished again
BTS At least there would be no lid to the trap
BTS Just so he went on
BTS It was patent to us what had happened
BTS To them this was the one feature of the day though it was good to loaf around after the fish was eaten for an hour or so with the other dogs of which there were fivescore and odd
BTS And so I gazed upon Maud's light-brown hair and loved it and learned more of love than all the poets and singers had taught me with all their songs and sonnets
BTS Now we have to do it all over again
BTS And damned glad you were to let them have it
BTS This had been Maud's idea and she had herself jealously gathered all the moss
BTS Another lesson
BTS yet this in itself was not so remarkable being done by the same creatures that flung sticks and stones to great distances
BTS He had gone to the roots of White Fang's nature and with kindness touched to life potencies that had languished and well-nigh perished
BTS Then why did you advise father to accept the vacation
BTS Maud Brewster
BTS Not necessary at all
BTS One quill he had carried away in his muzzle where it had remained for weeks a rankling flame until it finally worked out
BTS Mr
BTS Don't go please don't go
BTS She turned her head and beheld the sight
BTS It was ridiculous and ungainly lying there on his back with legs sprawling in the air
BTS In that day it was the custom of men to compete for purses of money
BTS At the same time he was made aware of a sensation of hunger
BTS 'Oo's goin' to do it
BTS Then you are an individualist a materialist and logically a hedonist
BTS There was no discussion about it
BTS There were both partners of the big drug firm of Kowalt  Washburn and Mr
BTS A heavy swivel-hook baited with fat salt-pork was dropped overside
BTS Of course life is valueless except to itself
BTS They went into the multitudinous divisions of the government took service in the colonial possessions and by tens of thousands went into the various secret services
BTS What was happening in the cities of the labor castes and Mercenaries
BTS There's the beauty of it
BTS for the wolf finding that no harm was intended finally sniffed noses with him
BTS He is a favourite of yours I said
BTS These misguided people sacrificed their own lives wantonly very often made our own plans go astray and retarded our organization
BTS Kelly cried stepping between me and the ladder his right hand shaped into a veritable strangler's clutch
BTS and I knew that a tie or a tacit something existed between us which had not existed before
BTS I shot a glance at the woman but she was leaning back in the arm-chair her eyes closed unutterably tired
BTS Larsen asked of me
BTS I found Wolf Larsen in the cabin stripped and bloody waiting for me
BTS Our lips were dry and cracked nor could we longer moisten them with our tongues
BTS The thunder of the streets smote upon his ears
BTS Wolf or dog it's all the same he's ben tamed 'ready
BTS Twenty feet away towered a huge dead spruce
BTS My lawyers and agents had taken care of my money for me
BTS I could not follow his reasoning but I was soon to learn it
BTS They had but one alternative--to leave the soil and become vagrants in brief to starve
BTS I was told that they thanked no one for instructing them in their social duties
BTS As he dozed off he was aroused by his comrade's voice
BTS but the enormous strength of the man was too much for my fortitude
BTS But there was little time for laughter in those days what of our heavy work and of the awfulness of Wolf Larsen's living death
BTS As she filled away and heeled the arm-chair began to slide across the cabin floor and I sprang for it just in time to prevent the rescued woman from being spilled out
BTS Shorn of its glamour and romance Arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and womanhood
BTS And there's not a soul in this world except myself that cares whether they starve or not
BTS Why my dear fellow you will live for ever
BTS Francois was surprised too when they shot out in a tangle from the disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble
BTS But it could not last long
BTS Instead he pointed towards the wall of darkness that pressed about them from every side
BTS but there were no sleds in the Southland nor did dogs pack burdens on their backs
BTS Get out of my way or I'll fix you
BTS Into his snarl he incorporated all that was vicious malignant and horrible
BTS For half a day this continued
BTS Remember that
BTS Understand
BTS The capitalistic system so far as they were concerned had hopelessly broken down
BTS I felt as though I should faint and reached out to the rail for support
BTS But she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody trampled snow almost literally torn to pieces the swart half-breed standing over her and cursing horribly
BTS Here we would catch a train to New York
BTS It was at the very beginning of the twentieth century A
BTS It was before this steady wind that he hoped to make the major portion of the run to Japan curving south into the tropics and north again as he approached the coast of Asia
BTS One was blown to pieces in the air the expedite exploding and the shock of it disrupted the second balloon which fell prettily into the remaining fortress
BTS I had never before seen him stripped and the sight of his body quite took my breath away
BTS My mind to me a kingdom is was the answer
BTS But he is not all wolf interposed Beth standing for her brother in his absence
BTS There was nothing stirring amidships
BTS The workers threw down their tools and left their tasks by the millions
BTS Standard Oil and Rockefeller--see upcoming footnote Rockefeller began as a member
BTS He towered like a Goliath above Wolf Larsen
BTS but both sides together were bewildering
BTS They came of generations of poor unlettered people peasants of the sea who sowed their sons on the waves as has been their custom since time began
BTS Sparkling points of light spluttered and shot past me
BTS As if in answer a great screaming roar went up dim with distance punctuated with detonation after detonation
BTS The Mercenaries were killing without quarter
BTS I have a counter proposition to make and for the good of your soul
BTS I shall always love it
BTS Humanity would be better and happier for it life fairer and sweeter
BTS I thought he must be somebody was the faro-dealer's comment
BTS This is the beginning
BTS He could not go beyond it
BTS The function of the corporation lawyer was to serve by corrupt methods the money-grabbing propensities of the corporations
BTS In camp he kept close to Mit-sah or Grey Beaver or Kloo-kooch
BTS In his random reading he had never chanced upon the Rubaiyat and it was to him like a great find of treasure
BTS The hunters have experimented and practised with their rifles and shotguns till they are satisfied and the boat-pullers and steerers have made their spritsails bound the oars and rowlocks in leather and sennit so that they will make no noise when creeping on the seals and put their boats in apple-pie order to use Leach's homely phrase
BTS They shook their heads
BTS The spar could not have missed me by many inches while it spurred me to action
BTS To sights and sounds and events which required action he responded with lightning-like rapidity
BTS Also he stood less in fear of them than formerly stalking among them with a certain careless ease that was as new to him as it was enjoyable
BTS order
BTS One does not give up a god easily and so with White Fang
BTS The other mug was fixed plenty
BTS Delay meant the coming against him of all the young dogs
BTS At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states
BTS Old One Eye was not interested at all but he followed her good-naturedly in her quest and when her investigations in particular places were unusually protracted he would lie down and wait until she was ready to go on
BTS It was the Ghost
BTS Watch out
BTS They're pretty wise them dogs
BTS But as she stitched on in silence I noticed the sadness in her pleasant eyes and the droop of her mouth
BTS I have a dread that he will turn upon them unexpectedly some day
BTS His money his position his culture could not save him
BTS Occasionally a solitary male was driven out by the sharp teeth of his rivals
BTS An outcast himself from the pack of the part-grown dogs his sanguinary methods and remarkable efficiency made the pack pay for its persecution of him
BTS They invaded the entrance killing the wounded and searching out the unhurt that like ourselves were playing dead
BTS Surely
BTS Wolf Larsen was apprehensive
BTS the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent
BTS You are sure of your resurrection
BTS Nothing was before us but the three or four months' hunting on the sealing grounds
BTS There was a puff of white smoke a burst of flame and the rough edge of the paper was alight
BTS And that the strength in me had quieted her and given her confidence filled me with an exultant joy
BTS In the Wild he had hunted live meat that was infinitely timid and he knew the advantage of surprise
BTS These quarrels were very common in those irrational and anarchic times
BTS He was adjusting himself
BTS I had seen the mechanism of the primitive fighting beast and I was as strongly impressed as if I had seen the engines of a great battleship or Atlantic liner
BTS Good-by
BTS He got out of bed carefully so as not to disturb the sleep of his comrade and threw more wood on the fire
BTS Of course my philosophy had always recognized the inevitableness of the love-call sooner or later
BTS but the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability to flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his hide
BTS The three men in it gazed at us suspiciously
BTS I don't know but it is there somewhere
BTS White Fang picked out the post for himself and Matt backed his judgment with strong language after the experiment had been tried
BTS Lively now
BTS She appealed to everybody and to everything finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries
BTS You were afraid to die
BTS He waited his opportunity to slink out of camp to the woods
BTS Is it not true that a machine-loom will weave more cloth and weave more cheaply than a hand-loom
BTS I think I have read something about them
BTS In order to face the constant danger of hurt and even of destruction his predatory and protective faculties were unduly developed
BTS They began to drop off to be brushed off against the sharp edge of the scuttle to be knocked off by the legs which were now kicking powerfully
BTS As yet it was not necessary to have recourse to the secret militia law
BTS Thank you Ernest said gravely
BTS It won't kill him I said
BTS And who knows
BTS It was a gala day
BTS I had unloaded the boat and carried its contents high up on the beach where I had set about making a camp
BTS Sight and scent became remarkably keen while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril
BTS Sir he said to the Skookum Bench king no sir
BTS Where we were I did not know though there was quite a likelihood that we were in the vicinity of the Ghost
BTS Do you know what I am going to do
BTS and he resolved to investigate after he had finished the business in hand
BTS he asked impatiently
BTS The Cause for this one time was lost but the Cause would be here to-morrow the same Cause ever fresh and ever burning
BTS Look at him Hump Wolf Larsen said to me look at this bit of animated dust this aggregation of matter that moves and breathes and defies me and thoroughly believes itself to be compounded of something good
BTS Then she looked at me and her face turned slowly toward the beach
BTS This murmur arose from all the land fraught with the joy of living
BTS One of the machines swerved wildly at high speed half a block down and the next moment already left well behind it the pavement was torn into a great hole by a bursting bomb
BTS His views were perilous to society and society could not conceive that such perilous views could be the product of a sane mind
BTS Step by step by the might of his arms the whole pack of men striving to drag him back and down he drew his body up from the floor till he stood erect
BTS Not for nothing had he first seen the light of day in a lonely lair and fought his first fights with the ptarmigan the weasel and the lynx
BTS At any rate the blues were gone and the blue devils had not put in an appearance
BTS He lets me take the work home now that I am old and the noise of the machine bothers my head
BTS Every man was tearing himself loose even Matthewson
BTS But does she work
BTS I demanded
BTS But you who read Spencer and Darwin and have never seen the inside of a school how did you learn to read and write
BTS These were always males and they were pressingly insistent on joining with One Eye and his mate
BTS There were the master's two sisters Beth and Mary
BTS You see labor has nothing concrete of which to be despoiled
BTS The fuel had run out and there was need to get more
BTS A sailor from time to time and quite methodically as a matter of routine dropped a canvas bucket into the ocean at the end of a rope hauled it in hand under hand and sluiced its contents over the prostrate man
BTS We did not have long to wait
BTS I worked my way through doing janitor-work
BTS A little later he made the end of the gaff where astride the spar itself he had a better chance for holding on
BTS Having learned to snuggle White Fang was guilty of it often
BTS It is the only answer that could be given
BTS He would die for the right if needs be he would be true to himself sincere with his soul
BTS For the first time in his fighting history men saw White Fang lose his footing
BTS so that I forgot myself and my mate's duties and took no part in helping the new-comers aboard
BTS Nature is a spendthrift
BTS Henry rolled over angrily on his side but was surprised that Bill made no similar display of temper
BTS For the Ghost so far as the seamen were concerned was a hell-ship of the worst description
BTS I demanded
BTS It was a little stream rising from springs and the hottest summer never dried it up
BTS The flesh and the qualms of the flesh she was heir to but the flesh bore heavily only on the flesh
BTS The sound of his voice made Maud quickly draw close to me as for protection and she rested one hand on my arm while we parleyed
BTS Wolf Larsen cried suddenly to the boat-puller
BTS I am like a sober man looking upon drunken men and greatly weary wishing he too were drunk
BTS The seals could depart on their mysterious journey into the south at any time now for all we cared
BTS He was aware of a certain strange satisfaction as though some need were being gratified as though some void in his being were being filled
BTS I dared not cross the continent in my own character
BTS We were not mere gloomy conspirators
BTS You have all the advantage
BTS In the ebb of their fortunes this sum was their total capital
BTS There is a large balance left over unconsumed
BTS It should be unnecessary to state at least to my friends that I was shocked
BTS Here he was compelled to violate his instinct of self-preservation and violate it he did for he was becoming tame and qualifying himself for civilisation
BTS A week later the Post Office Department ruled that the paper was seditious and barred it entirely from the mails
BTS question through the pages of every text-book written on the subject and stored on the shelves of your subsidized libraries
BTS I have an income I answered stoutly and could have bitten my tongue the next instant
BTS They are powerful in all the great railways of New York north east and west except one where their share is only a few millions
BTS With it we would repel the invasion of the regular army
BTS Looks almost cinnamon to me
BTS One night there was a heavy snowfall and in the morning Pike the malingerer did not appear
BTS To-morrow when the Great Revolt breaks out and all the world resounds with the tramp tramp of the millions the Oligarchy will realize and too late how mightily that band of heroes has grown
BTS There is no balance in their lives
BTS Came days of fog when even Maud's spirit drooped and there were no merry words upon her lips
BTS I had read sea-romances in my time wherein figured as a matter of course the lone woman in the midst of a shipload of men
BTS You have proved that to my satisfaction as well as yours
BTS I lived through three days of the Chicago Commune and the vastness of it and of the slaughter may be imagined when I say that in all that time I saw practically nothing outside the killing of the people of the abyss and the mid-air fighting between sky-scrapers
BTS White Fang was furious
BTS He was in the same position in which I had left him and his head was rocking almost writhing from side to side
BTS His reasoning was justified for the boat rushed at once into the wind and the hunter sprang aft to take the boat-steerer's place
BTS But father was wise enough to see it
BTS There was purpose in his method something for him to do that he was intent upon doing and from which nothing could distract him
BTS The clay of White Fang had been moulded until he became what he was morose and lonely unloving and ferocious the enemy of all his kind
BTS Her stick was tied to a peg in the ground and she could not follow him
BTS and he will embody his message in his introductory remarks
BTS I managed to make my way forward but there was little choice of sides for the weather-rail seemed buried as often as the lee
BTS The hand at my throat relaxed
BTS There are viols in your voice he said bluntly and his eyes flashed their golden light
BTS There was no room in their theoretical social evolution for an oligarchy therefore the Oligarchy could not be
BTS and while he faced that aspect uncowed he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused
BTS So long as the system of capitalistic production existed labor and capital continued to quarrel over the division of the joint-product
BTS But she was right
BTS Buck writhed his lips into the preliminary of a snarl but sniffed noses with him Whereupon the old wolf sat down pointed nose at the moon and broke out the long wolf howl
BTS Henry nodded his head approvingly
BTS I was in touch with great souls who exalted flesh and spirit over dollars and cents and to whom the thin wail of the starved slum child meant more than all the pomp and circumstance of commercial expansion and world empire
BTS Life
BTS His body was slender and rangy and his strength more stringy than massive His coat was the true wolf-grey and to all appearances he was true wolf himself
BTS but all the same you might be able to do us a favour some time when we need it damn bad
BTS This happened only last year and now she had been renamed
BTS Never was there so fine a display of the solidarity and the power of labor
BTS He smelled the meat carefully
BTS I trapped him behind large palms and rubber plants though he did not know he was trapped
BTS White Fang was in Grey Beaver's camp when Beauty Smith first visited it
BTS But this was accomplished only through my merging my life completely into his
BTS and to him as to the cold-tubbing races the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver
BTS This much I learned of him before I went to bed and I lay long awake listening in memory to the sound of his voice
BTS Let me tell you
BTS Billee wagged his tail appeasingly turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail and cried still appeasingly when Spitz's sharp teeth scored his flank
BTS I have heard you grow eloquent over the brave trade-wind
BTS The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me
BTS The student thinks in English and then transmutes into French or reads in French but transmutes into English before he can understand
BTS Wolf Larsen answered and as he started to ascend the stairs I cocked my revolver
BTS He haled forth Wolf Larsen's soul naked to the scorn of men
BTS He ran the gamut of denunciation rising to heights of wrath that were sublime and almost Godlike and from sheer exhaustion sinking to the vilest and most indecent abuse
BTS It was then that the white men rushed in visiting their wrath heavily on the pack while White Fang went free
BTS You are one with a crowd of men who have made what they call a government who are masters of all the other men and who eat the food the other men get and would like to eat themselves
BTS Some bands in strong positions fought gallantly but in the end every deserter from the militia met death
BTS This was more of the terrible unknown
BTS Therefore capital does not consume its share
BTS Jehovah was anthropomorphic because he could address himself to the Jews only in terms of their understanding
BTS Yes I said
BTS For look you he was saying as I see it a man does things because of desire
BTS The audience was agitated but unresponsive
BTS On either side stretched lawns their broad sweep broken here and there by great sturdy-limbed oaks
BTS He gave a short laugh
BTS You seem to worship at the shrine of fact Dr
BTS So White Fang hung around the landing with the disreputable gang of Indian dogs waiting for steamers
BTS Ain't thinkin' it'll hurt my digestion
BTS For myself beyond a word or so of suggestion or correction now and again I took no part
BTS There were lip-exclamations of approval on the part of the women and hoarser notes of confirmation came from the men
BTS High up on the beach of the second cove from ours we discovered the splintered wreck of a boat a sealer's boat for the rowlocks were bound in sennit a gun-rack was on the starboard side of the bow and in white letters was faintly visible Gazelle No
BTS Distribution was as confused and irrational as the whole general system of society
BTS Then we entered the fog
BTS After that the rest of you can come at me--but one at a time remember
BTS There was a hint just a slight hint of physical feebleness in his voice and it was so strange that I looked quickly at him
BTS I am very ignorant she pleaded
BTS They've got away with better men than you an' me Bill answered
BTS came the sharp command and this time he obeyed
BTS and the boats were hoisted in amid curses which if curses had power would have settled Death Larsen for all eternity Dead and damned for a dozen iv eternities commented Louis his eyes twinkling up at me as he rested from hauling taut the lashings of his boat
BTS By the light of the fire he crooked his fingers slowly and repeatedly now one at a time now all together spreading them wide or making quick gripping movements
BTS A hundred yards farther on Buck came upon one of the sled-dogs Thornton had bought in Dawson
BTS and Proletariat class 20393137
BTS At any rate we are safe now
BTS I neglected the boat and had the sail spilling the wind again and again such was my delight in following her every movement as she searched through the blankets for the pin
BTS I asked
BTS It looked at them in a strangely wistful way after the manner of a dog
BTS to decline
BTS That he's going home some day to see his mother I answered diplomatically
BTS The young leader snarled terribly but his snarl broke midmost into a tickling cough
BTS And in these cities will the oligarchs dwell and worship beauty
BTS Does capital consume all of its two billions
BTS The man smiled grimly and brought a hatchet and a club
BTS To get it patented to make money from it to revel in piggishness with all night in while other men do the work
BTS he was doing that for which he was made killing meat and battling to kill it
BTS Calvin Ernest said slyly
BTS The latter was not to be censured for his misjudgment
BTS I had not thought of it I replied wagging my head sagely
BTS She had discovered the china plate from which she was eating
BTS And then while I worked at building the hut Maud tried out the oil from the blubber and kept a slow fire under the frames of meat
BTS Matt stood staring along the sights at the empty space of snow which had been occupied by White Fang
BTS Johansen Wolf Larsen said briskly to the new mate keep all hands on deck now they're here
BTS With him were other boys
BTS They were not half living or quarter living
BTS Besides there was his old antipathy to being touched
BTS nor did he say anything further about my leaving his ship alone
BTS I suppose I'll have to hire one somewhere
BTS Then he resumed his course and trotted on along the base of the bluff
BTS Johnson I corrected and reached out my hand for his
BTS The dog-musher laid his hand on Beauty Smith's shoulder and faced him to the right about
BTS Incidentally the sled went faster and thus by cunning indirection did man increase his mastery over the beasts
BTS It was directly above him
BTS And I'll bet he sleeps in it Harrison added
BTS In loud voices they shouted over the day's fighting wrangled about details or waxed affectionate and made friends with the men whom they had fought
BTS These then were the cool captains of industry and lords of society these snarling growling savages in evening clothes
BTS There was soon literally no field of industry where their millions were not at work
BTS The natural course of his life had been diverted and recoiling from his kind he had clung to the human
BTS Yet again in this new orientation it was the thumb of circumstance that pressed and prodded him softening that which had become hard and remoulding it into fairer form
BTS Ah now you are up in the air again Ernest remarked dryly
BTS Get up now
BTS Van Weyden
BTS I asked
BTS The beggar came aboard without a cent
BTS God is noddin' and not doin' his duty though it's me as shouldn't say it
BTS All the fighting blood of his breed was up in him and surging through him
BTS this air does give one an appetite
BTS In the face of labor-saving machinery of organized production of the increased efficiency of combination you would set the economic sun back a whole generation or so to the time when there were no great capitalists no great machinery no railroads--a time when a host of little capitalists warred with each other in economic anarchy and when production was primitive wasteful unorganized and costly
BTS I did not dream of what was to occur until it did occur but he knew from the very first what was coming and awaited it bravely
BTS He tripped and was pulled off his feet
BTS They were short of weight and in poor condition when they made Dawson and should have had a ten days' or a week's rest at least
BTS Then there was a payment of bets and money clinked in Beauty Smith's hand
BTS Father wrote to the publishers and was informed that the plates had been accidentally injured
BTS The Bishop obeyed Christ's injunction and got locked up in a madhouse
BTS No coffee I said regretfully passing her buttered sea-biscuits and a slice of canned tongue
BTS He did not wait
BTS Now mother
BTS CHAPTER XX The remainder of the day passed uneventfully
BTS Their only effect upon him however was to make him uneasy and restless without his knowing what was the matter
BTS To crawl is piggish
BTS Outside was the common domain of all gods the roads and streets
BTS He was quick in his classification for he knew them at once for man-animal noises
BTS Ah he remarked with a wry pucker of his mouth I see you still believe in such things as right and wrong
BTS When he dozed upon his ears would steal the faint whispers of hidden trickles of running water and he would rouse and listen intently
BTS And it did
BTS Will you have some beef
BTS He had learned control and poise and he knew the law
BTS Ernest came one afternoon with father
BTS We dared not encourage such a spirit
BTS He carried himself with pride as though forsooth he had achieved a deed praiseworthy and meritorious
BTS Talk of a mess
BTS The Plutocracy had passed sentence on him
BTS I gave the actual facts of the case the long years Jackson had worked in the mills his effort to save the machinery from damage and the consequent accident and his own present wretched and starving condition
BTS He had seen dogs change owners in the past and he had seen the runaways beaten as he was being beaten
BTS But the Outside dogs though practically broken in since their landing did not amount to much
BTS She looked over the breakfast noting detail after detail
BTS Everhard was the father of this curious army and its accomplishments and successful persistence for three hundred years bear witness to the wisdom with which he organized and the solid foundation he laid for the succeeding generations to build upon
BTS and from him he was now to learn much of the change and development that had taken place in himself
BTS A boy's cap was perched on her head and her hair light brown and arranged in a loose and fluffy order that caught the sun seemed an aureole about the delicate oval of her face
BTS I didn't mean it Tommy' 'e was snifflin'
BTS It smacked of danger
BTS I left him lying on the poop
BTS Nope
BTS It flows on and on and it flows from competition to combination and from little combination to large combination and from large combination to colossal combination and it flows on to socialism which is the most colossal combination of all
BTS True I noticed a certain aloofness on the part of my general friends but this I ascribed to the disapproval that was prevalent in my circles of my intended marriage with Ernest
BTS T'row down de club Perrault commanded
BTS There was something tenacious about that lily-frail body of hers a clutch on existence which one could not reconcile with its patent weakness
BTS And the same with all the other unions outside the combination
BTS But we are not so made
BTS Bishop Morehouse was leaning forward and listening intently
BTS and second to the fact that they were less sensitively organized
BTS Then there were a number of grammars such as Metcalf's and Reed and Kellogg's
BTS Then White Fang to show his friendship will have to be chief mourner at the funeral laughed the master
BTS He knew how to take advantage of every cover to crawl on his belly like a snake and like a snake to leap and strike
BTS The frivolity of the laughter-loving Latins is no part of him
BTS They paid a fat dividend that quarter
BTS I am told that their children played in the parks during those terrible days and that their favorite game was an imitation of their elders stamping upon the proletariat
BTS And if it storms very hard
BTS I had forgotten to make provision for a flag-halyard
BTS White Fang heard it first and he was bristling with recognition while Grey Beaver still nodded stupidly
BTS It was a fresh breeze very fresh but I resolved to run as long as I dared
BTS But it lost time that night
BTS ' You are a sort of monster I added audaciously a Caliban who has pondered Setebos and who acts as you act in idle moments by whim and fancy
BTS There was no movement no sound
BTS They called themselves Sour-doughs and took great pride in so classifying themselves
BTS But blood had been shed and it was through no whim of Wolf Larsen that he had gone over the side with his scalp laid open
BTS With some difficulty and at the expense of a wetting to the waist I climbed aboard
BTS CHAPTER XXIII Brave winds blowing fair swiftly drove the Ghost northward into the seal herd
BTS No thought of disloyalty I am sure has ever entered his mind during all that time
BTS And the Church is dumb to-day
BTS We've only just started and we can't quit at the beginning
BTS He on the other hand learned that it was not necessary to use his teeth upon them
BTS What was the matter
BTS Dead astern sir
BTS but I knew that it would work and I felt myself a man of power as I looked at it
BTS There's too much of the schoolboy in me
BTS That will of his was breaking down
BTS Cawn't even carry a bit of tea aft without losin' it
BTS Hoist in your boat I said he repeated this time in sharper tones as they hesitated to do his bidding
BTS I never was
BTS Miss Brentwood thinks I am as mild as a kitten and as good-natured and stolid as the family cow
BTS I almost think I could have loved him for that alone
BTS in 1904 435040
BTS She broke the hearts of scores of our young comrades and scores of others she captured and by their heart-strings led into our organization
BTS He did a man's full work in that alone
BTS The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars
BTS Vast populations grew frenzied over such phrases as an honest dollar and a full dinner pail
BTS Is he like you
BTS but now their place was in my heart
BTS But he put the Ghost through her best paces so as to get between the deserters and the land
BTS I glanced up
BTS The door to his state-room was closed
BTS The two dogs were whimpering and snarling at his feet but she took no notice of them
BTS Grey Beaver would not have camped on the near side of the Mackenzie and White Fang would have passed by and gone on either to die or to find his way to his wild brothers and become one of them a wolf to the end of his days
BTS Again his stern mouth framed the twisted smile as he said Oh just to be alive to be living and doing to be the biggest bit of the ferment to the end to eat you
BTS By looking closely and steadily at where a pair of eyes burned in the darkness the form of the animal would slowly take shape
BTS He betrayed the inaccuracies of the self-read man and it must be granted the sureness and directness of the primitive mind
BTS Then during this same period there was the case of Moyer and Haywood two strong fearless leaders of labor
BTS After a time the voices died away and some time after that he crept out to enjoy the success of his undertaking
BTS The quivering came to an end suddenly
BTS The dog-musher secured a club and went over to the chained animal
BTS Later how much later I have no knowledge I came to myself with a start of fear
BTS It was a time of confusion and violence
BTS Being in no haste Indian fashion he hunted his dinner in the course of the day's travel
BTS and he delivered a multitude of blows
BTS Buck was the exception
BTS They were hard as iron
BTS The doctors had always said that I had a remarkable constitution but I had never developed it or my body through exercise
BTS They were adrift four days
BTS They do not know mankind nor society and yet they set themselves up as arbiters of the fates of the hungry millions and all the other millions thrown in
BTS In doing this they had protected both themselves and the gods whose companionship they shared
BTS I dare not come within reach of his arms and he knows that so long as his resistance is passive I cannot shoot him
BTS Matt it was who tried to put him into the harness and make him haul sled with the other dogs
BTS He was thinking deeply and I could see the lines of decision forming in his face
BTS Was your branch store the cause of it
BTS Without doubt he was on my trail for we had long since learned that my disappearance had been cause of deep concern to the secret service of the Oligarchy
BTS It is a kingly word
BTS Buck rushed at the splintering wood sinking his teeth into it surging and wrestling with it
BTS Next he dragged a dying woman over on top of me and with much squeezing and shoving crawled in beside me and partly over me
BTS But I say Hump he called down
BTS But to-night I'm Number 27 of the 'Frisco Reds
BTS they were slack and absent-minded in their service and they whispered gloomily to one another in the far end of the car next to the kitchen
BTS They are not philosophers
BTS It is the Master's work
BTS Came the day when Grey Beaver deciding that the liability of her running away was past released Kiche
BTS The very thing Mr
BTS The Ghost was hove to
BTS One of our generalizations is that every system founded upon class and caste contains within itself the germs of its own decay
BTS Asmunsen amiably confessed to the weakness
BTS In my fear I had forgotten that I was there to get the bull instead of to make him run
BTS As for myself I was oppressed with nightmare
BTS He complained of great pain in his head and it was during this period that he arranged a system of communication against the time when speech should leave him altogether one pressure of the hand for yes two for no
BTS Number four boat
BTS drowned his voice and he stood disdainfully till the din had somewhat subsided
BTS Hunting their living meat as the Yeehats were hunting it on the flanks of the migrating moose the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the land of streams and timber and invaded Buck's valley
BTS Johnson must have joined him immediately so that his abject and grovelling conduct on deck for the past few days had been no more than planned deception
BTS White Fang had practically ceased struggling
BTS And so with me if I should exercise what little moral courage I may possess
BTS Each shift brought the grip closer to his throat
BTS He sprang back with a snort
BTS Hist will ye
BTS Far and faint it was in the remote distance the cry of the hungry wolf-pack as it took the trail of other meat than the man it had just missed
BTS as many times as it doubled my strength that many times was doubled the length of rope I heaved in
BTS Thornton commanded
BTS or I'll sail you all into Kingdom Come
BTS Wolf Larsen pursed his lips in a long quizzical whistle
BTS Sometimes he exchanged the rapier for the club and went smashing amongst their thoughts right and left
BTS He had for the moment mistaken me for the man he hated
BTS While Maud was passing me the provisions and I was storing them in the boat a sailor came on deck from the forecastle
BTS no I won't
BTS Now they were really shocked and they sat wordless until Mr
BTS Though in splendid physical trim a thirty-six-hour trick at the wheel was the limit of my endurance
BTS He struck Cherokee about the head savagely again and again
BTS nor did he attempt to charge in when Sol-leks was once more brought forward
BTS He was right he knew he was right and he was unafraid
BTS You have used the wrong initial consonant he smiled in answer
BTS When they halted it halted throwing up its head and regarding them steadily with nostrils that twitched as it caught and studied the scent of them
BTS White Fang had quieted down and ceased snarling
BTS Her simple faith in the immediate future took me aback
BTS that dog's ben through hell
BTS With a long running-line coiled down in the stem I rowed well out into our little cove and dropped the anchor into the water
BTS Eh
BTS Life lived on life
BTS I had observed Henderson and Smoke loitering about the deck all morning and I now learned why they were there
BTS I cried
BTS They were capable of snapping a man off like a fly from a whip-lash
BTS Only he did not know it for an entrance
BTS She sprang away yelling with pain and while he took delight in the smell of burning flesh and hair he watched her shaking her head and growling wrathfully a score of feet away
BTS And repeatedly Ernest warned father to cease fighting and to take to cover
BTS Therefore the good is liked
BTS That is all
BTS and still others were lapping water from the pool
BTS Imagine so salty a phrase on the lips of the Humphrey Van Weyden of a few months gone
BTS There is no getting away from it
BTS Asmunsen
BTS All his life he had tended and operated on the soft humans of civilisation who lived sheltered lives and had descended out of many sheltered generations
BTS It's by hard work I got to my present exalted position
BTS Had he done so I should have managed somehow to carry Miss Brewster away with me
BTS But what struck me most forcibly was the total lack of sympathy on the part of the men whom I served
BTS Look at the intelligence of him Scott went on hastily
BTS She was following my advice
BTS Her beam or width is twenty-three feet and her length a little over ninety feet
BTS For the first time in their lives they knew industrial peace
BTS You are all squealing
BTS Sons will succeed fathers and there will be no inflow of new strength from that eternal reservoir of strength the common people
BTS How can I ever trust you again
BTS It was as though our last stormy meeting was forgotten
BTS P
BTS Must a' butted clean through it b'gosh
BTS There are the jute mills you know and the same thing goes on there
BTS White Fang flattened his ears ingratiatingly but remained where he was making no attempt to approach
BTS On the sled securely lashed was a long and narrow oblong box
BTS and from the poop we watched him turn and start aft on our track
BTS Let me prophesy
BTS To-night he is chairman of the I
BTS In this instance I could not see but I could hear the impact of the blows the soft crushing sound made by flesh striking forcibly against flesh
BTS below there
BTS She turned and trotted back into the forest to the great relief of One Eye who trotted a little to the fore until they were well within the shelter of the trees
BTS His suspicions had been aroused
BTS It was another instance of the plasticity of his clay of his capacity for being moulded by the pressure of environment
BTS he asked
BTS The weight of iron dragged it down
BTS My only doctrine is the doctrine of expediency and it makes for surviving
BTS He looked at me insolently
BTS Bill nodded
BTS At the end of half an hour one man stated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds and walk off with it
BTS Because men groping in the Arctic darkness had found a yellow metal and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find thousands of men were rushing into the Northland
BTS Now MUSH
BTS His body was sagging at the hips his great shoulders were drooping and shrinking forward
BTS By some freak of the waters I had been swept clear under the forecastle-head and into the eyes
BTS But it seems you have breath to use and I'll give you a chance to use it
BTS As the time went by I marvelled that I was still alive
BTS What I did find was monstrous selfishness and heartlessness and a gross gluttonous practised and practical materialism
BTS That's why we live so long
BTS He made a futile rush at White Fang clipping the empty air with an outraged snap
BTS I realized that all those potatoes and that bread and butter and meat were mine and that I had not worked to make them
BTS Asmunsen replied curtly
BTS He came back with it and assaulted the window of a store behind us
BTS The very thing
BTS Van Weyden stand by to pass the head-sails over
BTS Yet they were more fortunate than the Grangers who captured a dozen state governments and who in the spring were not permitted to take possession of the captured offices
BTS yet White Fang divined that it was his master's food he ate and that it was his master who thus fed him vicariously
BTS Their children--always the young life that it is their instinct to protect
BTS You spend what you haven't got and in return you get greater value from spending what you haven't got than I get from spending what I have got and what I have sweated to get
BTS Three Eagles was going away on a trip up the Mackenzie to the Great Slave Lake
BTS As quietly as was possible I clewed up the topsails lowered the flying jib and staysail backed the jib over and flattened the mainsail
BTS At her solicitation I let her take the watch till midnight it was then nine o'clock but I wrapped her in blankets and put an oilskin about her before I lay down
BTS He was sounding the deeps of his nature and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he going back into the womb of Time
BTS Hammerfield was angry righteously angry
BTS But the trusts themselves arose out of competition Mr
BTS All the work was in the preparation
BTS There was nothing strange about it
BTS Yet all three animals were keyed to a tenseness of living that was almost painful and scarcely ever would it come to them to be more alive than they were then in their seeming petrifaction
BTS The right foot was missing amputated neatly at the ankle
BTS while he would have welcomed with delight Lip-lip and the whole snarling cowardly pack
BTS Too damned fat and lazy to stand a four-hour watch
BTS Charles sat down on a log to rest
BTS Matt demanded
BTS All night I steered without relief the wind slowly and steadily increasing and the sea rising
BTS And you are mad cosmos-makers
BTS He at once put the Ghost upon her course a course which meant the seal herd and not Yokohama harbour
BTS My feet went out from under me
BTS It can never be taken away from me because it can never be found
BTS No spring or rebound was left in them
BTS The weasel was a drinker of blood and it was ever her preference to drink from the throat of life itself
BTS Well you'll know all right when we pull into McGurry
BTS For centuries the Wild had stood for terror and destruction
BTS Even the labor castes of the city were alive with revolt
BTS The Macedonia belching the blackest of smoke from her funnel was charging down upon us from out of the north-east
BTS For your own good I warn you
BTS I thought so he muttered
BTS To live
BTS Whom
BTS Life or death
BTS I asked
BTS We'll send you to Congress and it will be all right they told him at one of our secret meetings
BTS It is interesting to note the virilities of language that were common speech in that day as indicative of the life 'red of claw and fang' that was then lived
BTS I had not realized there could be so much pain in a kick
BTS There was no hope for him
BTS At that time he was a mere puppy soft from the making without form ready for the thumb of circumstance to begin its work upon him
BTS He's not clean crazy sure
BTS was Hans's contribution
BTS Karl Marx--the great intellectual hero of Socialism
BTS Now and again a pair of eyes moved or disappeared to appear again a moment later
BTS 'You might give me back my home' I said 'and my stock in the Sierra Mills
BTS It should never occur again
BTS The afternoon would show far more accomplished
BTS Do you know you are deaf in the right ear
BTS Mr
BTS The hell
BTS Each year one had come from the press and to me each was the advent of the year
BTS It is wrong
BTS In order to make the exhibition interesting he was kept in a rage most of the time
BTS Has the Church protested
BTS A standing army of professional soldiers was created officered by members of the Oligarchy and known as the Mercenaries
BTS The scientist reasons inductively from the facts of experience
BTS I really believe that a finely-organized high-strung man would suffer twice and thrice as much as they from a like injury
BTS Besides all my brother critics were with me
BTS Violent death ever stalked in their midst
BTS As I say the sight gratified me
BTS He was not a free agent
BTS I cannot see hearing and feeling are leaving me at this rate I shall soon cease to speak
BTS He came cringing and crawling into the firelight
BTS They gave trail to him when he came and went or walked among them and when he asserted his will they obeyed
BTS You can sit on a chair
BTS For he knew that there floating in the blue above him was meat the meat his stomach yearned after so insistently
BTS His master's voice acted on Buck like an electric shock He sprang to his feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous departure
BTS Calvin who were themselves farmers long since expropriated captured the farmers and threw their political strength away in a vain campaign
BTS And then I realized something more
BTS they are made to show honor to those who have lost the sense even of shame
BTS Before Colonel Van Gilbert had succeeded in sitting down Ernest was on his feet and had sprung forward
BTS Gentlemen a metaphysician is a medicine man
BTS The longer he walked the better he walked
BTS Once in the pursuit of a rabbit which she ordinarily would have caught with ease she gave over and lay down and rested
BTS To run down meat was to experience thrills and elations
BTS I have paid my dues for twenty-two years
BTS Then I recollected Maud
BTS He had been guilty of running the Ghost several points off her course in order that what little wind there was should fill the foresail and hold it steady
BTS Henry I was a-thinkin' what a blame sight luckier he is than you an' me'll ever be
BTS it was the sum of the terrors of the unknown the one culminating and unthinkable catastrophe that could happen to him about which he knew nothing and about which he feared everything
BTS They're weak as water if you want to know came the reply from one of the men
BTS Where's Lord Alfred
BTS Eh
BTS There was a grunt from Weedon Scott's bunk and a stir of blankets
BTS White Fang sprang clear just in time to escape the descending blow
BTS What chance had I
BTS She rushed upon White Fang in frenzied wrath
BTS Twilight had set in by the time this was accomplished
BTS The cub snarled a little at the touch of the hand and the hand flew back to administer a clout
BTS Then my knees gave from under me and I sank down myself again but overcome by shock at knowledge of what I had so nearly done
BTS Matt might talk gently to him or swear at him it was all the same
BTS As the years went by we bought back those bonds
BTS Because of White Fang's very great love a cuff from the master hurt him far more than any beating Grey Beaver or Beauty Smith had ever given him
BTS This ecstasy this forgetfulness of living comes to the artist caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame
BTS When Buck and Curly grew excited half wild with fear he raised his head as though annoyed favored them with an incurious glance yawned and went to sleep again
BTS I was so comfortable and secure that even his flaming lyrics failed to stir me
BTS And all the time our men waited in the refuge weapons in hand--automatic revolvers and rifles to say nothing of half a dozen infernal machines of Biedenbach's manufacture
BTS These were conscious actions and were the results of his first generalisations upon the world
BTS In the end it will take it all away from you
BTS Then there were comrades these were the women for the men would be busy elsewhere who were to post the proclamations from our secret presses
BTS Among others to show the whimsicality of their deadly seriousness may be mentioned the following The Bleeding Hearts Sons of the Morning the Morning Stars The Flamingoes The Triple Triangles The Three Bars The Rubonics The Vindicators The Comanches and the Erebusites
BTS It goes through the factory and comes out in the form of shoes worth let us say two hundred dollars
BTS All he could hope for all he sought was some hole to crawl away in and hide like any animal
BTS Purpose
BTS He put his hand upon her head and she only crouched closer
BTS He was a carnivorous animal
BTS You know you only mean that in relation to human life for of the flesh and the fowl and the fish you destroy as much as I or any other man
BTS We watched him travel slowly inward threading about among the harems along what must have been the path
BTS Thanks to my brother Death I've lighted on a fortune
BTS He left the chair just as he sat in it squarely springing from the sitting posture like a wild animal a tiger and like a tiger covered the intervening space
BTS and for weeks upon end they would camp here and there the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire
BTS They were coated solidly with ice and the two men kept them on the run around the fire sweating and thawing so close that they were singed by the flames
BTS but single fight was denied him
BTS He knew he was at last answering the call running by the side of his wood brother toward the place from where the call surely came
BTS I ran forward and had the downhaul of the flying jib all in and fast as we slipped by the boat a hundred feet to leeward
BTS He sat for a long while upon the sled
BTS In less than an hour I had the maintopmast on deck and was constructing the shears
BTS The young fellow laughed and followed his captor into the house
BTS Silently without flinching he took a second cut in his forward rush and as he leaped for the throat the groom cried out My God
BTS He stalked the quarry and found it to be a porcupine standing upright against a tree and trying his teeth on the bark
BTS Good-bye Lucifer I whispered to myself as I softly closed the door
BTS She regarded him with amazement unconcealed
BTS There was no answer
BTS This accomplished he cruised back and forth across what he knew must be their course
BTS Page one hundred and twenty-six 'The cycle of class struggles which began with the dissolution of rude tribal communism and the rise of private property will end with the passing of private property in the means of social existence
BTS Nothing happened though the adjacent portions of the tepee moved
BTS This gentleness and violence on his part was a curious blend similar to the one in his carriage of awkwardness and ease
BTS A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed his muscles swelled out and the flesh came back to cover his bones
BTS Mercedes looked at them imploringly untold repugnance at sight of pain written in her pretty face
BTS You have gone up in the air and are arranging a division between the kind of men that ought to be but are not
BTS Hints that were untrue of course were given of insubordination all over the land crudely disguised with complacent references to punitive measures to be taken
BTS That night he lifted the long wolf-howl
BTS We followed in his wake a space then dropped down a zigzag trail that he disdained into a group of noble redwoods that stood about a pool of water murky with minerals from the mountain side
BTS I asked
BTS Hammerfield taunted him
BTS I shall have to arm myself before I dare go on deck with him
BTS Wolf Larsen who had sat about and listened all afternoon and never opened his mouth had taken himself off to the galley and started his supper
BTS Fortune seemed to favour him
BTS Against the wall near the head of the bunk was a rack filled with books
BTS wherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans with Buck and half a dozen other dogs faced into the East on an unknown trail to achieve where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed
BTS I had seen a distant headland past the extreme edge of the promontory and as we looked we could see grow the intervening coastline of what was evidently a deep cove
BTS The potatoes he murmured faintly
BTS If she were heading south-west as Johnson had said the wind then I calculated was blowing nearly from the south
BTS The trial was prompt and brief
BTS This is the idea of Miss Brentwood
BTS and in that moment I hated him
BTS For the first time I knew the wonderful truth of his words
BTS The Group was composed only of men
BTS No nevaire
BTS I saw Maud my Maud straining and struggling and crushed in the embrace of Wolf Larsen's arms
BTS But it is unlawful was the protest
BTS Day by day unions and more unions voted their support to the socialists until even Ernest laughed when the Undertakers' Assistants and the Chicken Pickers fell into line
BTS But that leap was never made
BTS He wondered how and when the meal would begin
BTS Then he discovered him standing where he had been lying near to the stove
BTS Ye should iv seen the old man's face
BTS To the rear from around the last bend and plainly into view on the very trail they had just covered trotted a furry slinking form
BTS Wolf Larsen shouted springing himself to the rope in advance of the quickest
BTS Also and quite as a matter of course as though in his life he had already made a thousand toilets he proceeded to lick away the dry clay that soiled him
BTS The figures of misery would have precipitated the revolution that even now is gathering
BTS You would escape the problem of the surplus by not producing any surplus
BTS Henderson duplicated it selecting Harrison's right oar
BTS During the early summer in the last days of the famine he met Lip-lip who had likewise taken to the woods where he had eked out a miserable existence
BTS It's got away with three of our dogs an' we oughter put a stop to it
BTS Whither was I drifting
BTS And I thought of his father who had lied and stolen for him and been worked to death
BTS Stop it if you can
BTS he demanded
BTS It was what might be termed a sinewy knotty strength of the kind we ascribe to lean and wiry men but which in him because of his heavy build partook more of the enlarged gorilla order
BTS but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil
BTS Be sure and lock the front door
BTS They were perambulating skeletons
BTS No mention is made of him anywhere save in the Everhard Manuscript
BTS He glanced casually at the huddling dogs
BTS Each building was a possible ambuscade
BTS Where's my wife
BTS I was supposed to be Ernest's sister
BTS It was all very silly he knew
BTS The revolutionists maintained schools of acting in all their refuges
BTS And how do you propose to avoid producing a surplus
BTS the Bishop demanded warmly
BTS It is piggishness and it is life
BTS It was by the merest chance that we had found each other in that terrible city
BTS This was a serious masquerade on the part of Avis Everhard
BTS You're right Matt
BTS But I don't think we'll ever need to call our men out again
BTS So he arose and trotted forlornly back to camp pausing once and twice to sit down and whimper and to listen to the call that still sounded in the depths of the forest
BTS This was her day and it came not often when manes bristled and fang smote fang or ripped and tore the yielding flesh all for the possession of her
BTS Louis gazing fixedly betrayed a trouble in his face he was not quite able to hide
BTS They do get on the nerves horrible  Henry sympathised
BTS but Ernest shrugged his shoulders and with an I have nothing to say went on eating salted almonds
BTS We of the East have seen to very little of you too little indeed of the Dean of American Letters the Second
BTS The police had broken countless heads with their riot clubs
BTS Further letting drop the volume during a lurch of the ship a sheet of paper fell out
BTS Life in general might still be sacred but life in the particular case of Thomas Mugridge had become very profane indeed
BTS Do be cautious she called after me
BTS I remember thinking how comfortable it was this division of labour which made it unnecessary for me to study fogs winds tides and navigation in order to visit my friend who lived across an arm of the sea
BTS The general tone of the team picked up immediately
BTS Hadn't seen it for three years he said
BTS but Maud advanced the theory to prepare me for disappointment I do believe if disappointment were to come that we had discovered an unknown rookery
BTS What if we crush the bear
BTS He could feel the pricking and stinging of the old anger as it strove to rise up in him but it strove against love
BTS Finally the additional quarter of a cent was denied us
BTS He left his personal feelings at home when he went down to the office
BTS But I knew and his genius and my judgment were vindicated when he made that magnificent hit with his Forge
BTS His club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs and the grub-box was capsized on the ground
BTS It will though when I learn to steer which I certainly shall
BTS You have made no food
BTS There was fresh meat in camp
BTS The regular troops fought the farmers as savagely as had they been Indians
BTS Besides I was not skilled in the speech of eyes
BTS It took the place of like which latter had been the highest feeling that thrilled him in his intercourse with the gods
BTS But should you change your belief to something that menaces the established order your preaching would be unacceptable to your employers and you would be discharged
BTS She had heard the cry of her cub and was dashing to save him
BTS There was a correspondence in rhythm between the growls and the movements of the man's hands
BTS I was beginning to see through the appearances of the society in which I had always lived and to find the frightful realities that were beneath
BTS His brow clouded at the allusion
BTS Latimer pulled and the next couple of steps were made with a rush
BTS So Omar so I so you even you for you rebelled against dying when Cooky sharpened a knife for you
BTS Both men stopped
BTS He said much more of the same vague sort and I couldn't pin him down to anything specific
BTS All I do is to put it on a star revolve the scale till it is opposite those figures on the map underneath and presto
BTS Hammerfield who said It is when their thinking is wrong that they are asked to resign
BTS When Thornton's partners Hans and Pete arrived on the long-expected raft Buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to Thornton
BTS Who earned it
BTS And I could see Charley Furuseth as I had said good-bye to him that morning lounging in a dressing-gown on the be-pillowed window couch and delivering himself of oracular and pessimistic epigrams
BTS Why with all that wonderful strength have you not done something
BTS As it was the situation stopped there in the only way it could
BTS You have not told the whole story I said with conviction
BTS Jump Buck
BTS It came upon me suddenly as strange that nothing moved aboard
BTS The men rode and ran by turn and the dogs were kept on the jump with but infrequent stoppages
BTS He was sore beset
BTS If it were his eyeballs only that were affected or if his optic nerve were not wholly destroyed the explanation was simple
BTS And as Buck understood the oaths to be love words so the man understood this feigned bite for a caress
BTS Chopping down young saplings he made them cross-bars of a scaffold by lashing them high up to the trunks of standing trees
BTS And they were forgetting themselves now
BTS CHAPTER XX A LOST OLIGARCH But in remembering the old life I have run ahead of my story into the new life
BTS There was no need for him to go and see what had happened
BTS The forecastle was like an angry hive of bees aroused by some marauder
BTS You and I are just like them
BTS It was ahem shall we say Providence
BTS A gaping throat explained the manner of his death
BTS He was not so large he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds for his mother Shep had been a Scotch shepherd dog
BTS He was realising his own meaning in the world
BTS He is a puppet
BTS In the middle of it White Fang rushing in sank his teeth into Lip-lip's hind leg
BTS Latimer reached down with his free hand
BTS But he won't pull those chaps around from the look of it he added pointing at the Macedonia's third boat for which I had been steering and which was now nearly abreast of us
BTS Spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown slashing Buck down the shoulder and leaping clear
BTS Hammerfield he was unused to this fierce infighting as Ernest called it
BTS The Scotch half-breed called a halt and took him out of the team making the next dog Sol-leks fast to the sled
BTS No one accepted his offer and he went on In which event I'll lay ten to one there's trouble breezing up
BTS when he could no longer pull he fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to his feet again
BTS Crickets sang in the nights and in the days all manner of creeping crawling things rustled forth into the sun
BTS easy as she goes Wolf Larsen finally said
BTS And none so poor not even Hump to do him reverence he sneered
BTS We saw the police disappearing down the cross-streets on the run and knew that something terrible was coming
BTS What you need is quinine an' I'm goin' to dose you up stiff as soon as we make McGurry
BTS Buck did not read the newspapers or he would have known that trouble was brewing not alone for himself but for every tide-water dog strong of muscle and with warm long hair from Puget Sound to San Diego
BTS You see with these additions I've about all the crew I want
BTS The new-comer did not understand
BTS He was obviously questing back through Ernest's reasoning in search of an error
BTS He stood on his dignity and when they attempted it his warning snarl and bristling mane were anything but playful
BTS and I could see sympathy warm in her eyes
BTS On the other hand when there have been accidents increased expenses of operating or contracts with less profitable terms I have always succeeded in getting the railroad to lower its rate
BTS I keep square all right with my own conscience
BTS We do get justice
BTS People eat therefore they must procure the wherewithal
BTS He cleared the sheet and was free to return slightly downhill now along the halyards to the mast
BTS and his blood carried it to the farthest reaches of his body building it into the toughest and stoutest of tissues
BTS And it's slack off the sheets for Japan
BTS Because of this he made heroic efforts to arise and at last he stood on his four legs tottering and swaying back and forth
BTS One result of this was to make White Fang more ferocious and indomitable and more solitary
BTS Wouldn't take a sou less so help me
BTS then I whirled around abruptly and confronted--the Bishop
BTS He no longer was afraid of anything
BTS And so it ended with the phrase she knew had all power over me
BTS Matt reached for the rifle and at the same moment White Fang snarled
BTS Again his face became impassioned and he lifted it not to me but to heaven
BTS It was all I could do to keep from groaning aloud
BTS I debated a moment looking him squarely in the eyes
BTS she asked him
BTS This meant me I thought and then the blankness and darkness rose over me
BTS There came a day when Billee the good-natured fell and could not rise
BTS All is granted
BTS Fully a score he could count staring hungrily at him or calmly sleeping in the snow
BTS In those days it was still the custom to fill the living rooms with bric-a-brac
BTS The capitalist being selfish wants all he can get in the division
BTS We'll say we thought it was the mate said one
BTS Symptoms I said
BTS He kept Francois busy for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take place sooner or later
BTS Here is a shoe factory
BTS It partook of the magnitude and volume of distant thunder and it came to us directly from leeward rising above the crash of the surf and travelling directly in the teeth of the storm
BTS It is just as mysterious to me
BTS Three times he struggled to his feet striving to gain the galley and each time was knocked down
BTS Ernest stopped and put the question point blank to a number of the men
BTS Out of this water I could see the two masts rising and that was all
BTS What else could that expression have meant that dancing tremulous light and a something more which words could not describe
BTS Then you were not at liberty to tell the whole truth as you had sworn to do
BTS To that intelligence there could be no objective knowledge of a body
BTS As Buck drew himself together to spring after them out of the tail of his eye he saw Spitz rush upon him with the evident intention of overthrowing him
BTS What has happened
BTS Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost
BTS On examination we found that he had three
BTS When Mit-sah cried out his command for the team to stop White Fang obeyed
BTS I know that I could not avoid dropping my eyes and I was quite relieved when I passed him on and turned to greet Bishop Morehouse--a favorite of mine a sweet and serious man of middle age Christ-like in appearance and goodness and a scholar as well
BTS The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed
BTS And yet Maud declared that she had never felt better or stronger in her life
BTS No reference was made on either side to the destruction of the shears
BTS that he was glad there was an impending struggle
BTS He no longer felt anything though very faintly he could hear the impact of the club upon his body
BTS Why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate
BTS Home with you you wolf
BTS Pertonwaithe's great house I looked back at it and I remembered Ernest's expression that they were bound to the machine but that they were so bound that they sat on top of it
BTS He dogged his master's heels whenever he left the cabin and haunted the front stoop when he remained inside
BTS The noise he made was too much for the moose-bird who sought safety in flight
BTS He knew the injustice and greediness of the older dogs when meat or fish was thrown out to be eaten
BTS At first this caused trouble for the other dogs
BTS There were no snap judgments
BTS The whole thing was so unlike the Wolf Larsen I had known
BTS I saw more of Wolf Larsen than ever when we had gained the grounds
BTS I smiled in superior fashion and slacking off on one of the boom-guys and taking in on the other swung the mast perfectly in the centre of the deck
BTS What power have the farmers
BTS The state court sustained the decision
BTS When they arrived at Skaguay they were apparently on their last legs
BTS The unrest of the dogs had been increasing and they stampeded in a surge of sudden fear to the near side of the fire cringing and crawling about the legs of the men
BTS and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst even Spitz left him alone
BTS Mugridge called an 'owlin' sou'-easter
BTS The old-party orators were usually greeted with empty halls though occasionally they encountered full halls where they were so roughly handled that more than once it was necessary to call out the police reserves
BTS A revolver-shot rang out
BTS Each was nothing that the other was everything that the other was not
BTS The cabin was small to begin with and to move around as I was compelled to was not made easier by the schooner's violent pitching and wallowing
BTS And why do you think I have made this thing
BTS It was well I did for it covered the boat fully a third of the way aft and three times in the next several hours it flung off the bulk of the down-rushing water when the bow shoved under the seas
BTS Have you a catacomb here
BTS In some way the third finger had been crushed to a pulp
BTS Put Cooky to work on it
BTS I am doomed to be broken he said to me
BTS 'Tis a visitation for his black-hearted deeds and there's more behind and comin' or else  Or else I prompted
BTS It employs forty thousand lawyers to defeat the people in the courts
BTS The belly flashed white in swift upward rush
BTS To him it stood as the greatest of hurts
BTS but in the face of them my reason tells me wrong and most wrong that to dream and live illusions gives greater delight
BTS If one doesn't get you the other will
BTS And it is of course over-estimated since it is of necessity prejudiced in its own favour
BTS When I was promoted to foreman I got married then the family came and
BTS what of the destruction of the farmers and the middle class
BTS And while the whole face was the incarnation of fierceness and strength the primal melancholy from which he suffered seemed to greaten the lines of mouth and eye and brow seemed to give a largeness and completeness which otherwise the face would have lacked
BTS perfectly well
BTS 'Cos you've 'urt yer pore little leg pore little mamma's darlin'
BTS And I make free to say that for the time being life assumed the same sordid values to me
BTS He now reasoned it
BTS I have no fictions that make for nobility and manhood
BTS They wanted blood and revenge
BTS And history tells of opportunities that came to the slaves who rose to the purple he answered grimly
BTS Really it is impossible he said
BTS The next moment soldiers were clearing the galleries and I saw no more
BTS but the wreck was securely lashed for it could be patched and made whole again
BTS He could now see the man-animals driving back the dogs with clubs and stones defending him saving him from the savage teeth of his kind that somehow was not his kind
BTS I've got a sled standing outside now with twenty fiftypound sacks of flour on it Matthewson went on with brutal directness
BTS Where's the mate
BTS The porcupine rolled itself into a ball radiating long sharp needles in all directions that defied attack
BTS many great factories were standing idle against the time when the surplus should be gone
BTS Beauty Smith enjoyed the task
BTS If labor wins your way will be easy
BTS With a shrug of the shoulders but with the warmest admiration and pride at heart for this woman I equipped her with the broken oar and took another for myself
BTS I crept to the front of the store
BTS he cried
BTS but that Wolf Larsen stormed the last strongholds of my faith with a vigour that received respect while not accorded conviction
BTS There were cats at the houses the master visited that must be let alone
BTS And the song would be 'Blessed are the trusts
BTS The issue is the Workers versus the Plutocracy
BTS I glanced up
BTS A little less than a hundred years ago and a little more than six hundred years after the death the confession of Pervaise was discovered in the secret archives of the Vatican
BTS It was his mate who relieved him from the quandary in which he found himself
BTS Once more the clenched fists went upward and he groaned
BTS Then he stood without movement as before the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him
BTS Take him away Scott commanded and Tim Keenan dragged Cherokee back into the crowd
BTS There was more cursing and a mocking laugh and when all was quiet I stole outside and found a heavy knife imbedded over an inch in the solid wood
BTS Also he had once nearly had an eye poked out by a toddling papoose
BTS Asmunsen
BTS Perhaps she had gone up
BTS Dat one dam bully dog
BTS I could have thought him the old Wolf Larsen and yet there was in his movements a vague suggestion of weakness and indecision
BTS Something was impending
BTS You say something else
BTS I was opening a can of tongue at the moment and I sprang to the sheet and cast it off just in time
BTS The usual fire was necessary to save them
BTS It crushed them into the remotest recesses of their own minds pressing out of them like juices from the grape all the false ardours and exaltations and undue self-values of the human soul until they perceived themselves finite and small specks and motes moving with weak cunning and little wisdom amidst the play and inter-play of the great blind elements and forces
BTS But I had not reckoned upon the colossal task the reefing of three sails meant for one man
BTS The three partners were lining a long and narrow poling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty-Mile Creek
BTS At such moments starting from a windward roll I would go flying through the air with dizzying swiftness as though I clung to the end of a huge inverted pendulum the arc of which between the greater rolls must have been seventy feet or more
BTS of going out with the boats from the time I could crawl
BTS This had been one of the things taught him by the master and White Fang obeyed though he lay down reluctantly and sullenly
BTS I looked with misgiving toward the south-west and thought of the six hundred miles of hardship before us ay if it were no worse than hardship
BTS His fee for this one act was five hundred thousand dollars
BTS also my wisdom returned with me
BTS No visitors were allowed while it was the Philomath's policy to permit none of its discussions to get into the papers
BTS Wages are going to be advanced and hours shortened in the railroad unions the iron and steel workers unions and the engineer and machinist unions
BTS He had ceased from his growling and stood head up looking into their faces
BTS It means hundreds of thousands a year to the stockholders he said
BTS So greatly had he suffered and so far gone was he that the blows did not hurt much
BTS So he patiently went the round of the publishing houses
BTS He cared to serve nothing
BTS The Bishop nodded
BTS There were no dairymen only a Milk Trust
BTS Straight forward he raced the boat-puller Harrison at his heels and gaining on him
BTS They enforced their live strength with the power of dead things
BTS You have no right to put temptation in the way of your fellow-creatures
BTS Turn in all hands and get some sleep
BTS At first the cubs whimpered and cried but for the most part they slept
BTS It was true there were other dogs There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place but they did not count
BTS There seemed a tacit conspiracy against Jackson and I was aware of a thrill of sympathy for the whining lawyer who had ingloriously fought his case
BTS But then I had not seen a woman for a very long time
BTS Hammerfield was temporarily crushed and the battle raged on in new directions
BTS He went about in it with greater confidence with a feeling of prowess that had not been his in the days before the battle with the lynx
BTS So snug and warm was it that he was loath to leave it when Francois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire
BTS It ended with Johnson flinging off Louis's detaining arm and starting forward
BTS So with a You beast
BTS They go away in the fall so I must soon begin to lay in a supply of meat
BTS The lightened sled bounded on its side behind them
BTS And still in the air the she-wolf's jaws closed on the lean yellow body and the weasel knew death between the crunching teeth
BTS The Iron Heel will not be able to prevent it and in the end caste will destroy the Iron Heel
BTS But the gates of speech were closed and we too rose from the table and laughed awkwardly
BTS and it was for this reason when the Second Revolt was crushed that they too were crushed by the united oligarchies of the world their socialist governments being replaced by oligarchical governments
BTS Mercedes's scream came to their ears
BTS Grey Beaver was breaking the lump of tallow in half
BTS His voice grew strong and confident and it glowed as he glowed and as the thoughts glowed that poured out from him
BTS I asked a note of protest in my voice
BTS I knew it now for what it was
BTS It was from the east and like a whisper it came and went
BTS He was a beautiful creature almost feminine in the pleasing lines of his figure and there was a softness and dreaminess in his large eyes which seemed to contradict his well-earned reputation for strife and action
BTS But the slope grew more gradual and its base was grass-covered
BTS masters in the art were developing and a fund of tricks and expedients was being accumulated
BTS She had not moved
BTS They wasted their time sending us here
BTS All his days no matter what the odds he had never run from a fight
BTS There was not the faintest whisper of air nothing moved not a leaf quivered the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air
BTS As they slid along noiseless as shadows in the moonlight they came upon a run-way
BTS I bet none of the others would do it
BTS He merely thrashed his team-mates
BTS And he went about it in a way that reminded me of a story out of Boccaccio
BTS He felt strangely numb
BTS Shoulder to shoulder he struck her squarely
BTS I had seen the people of the abyss before gone through its ghettos and thought I knew it
BTS I make up for it in part by doing my own cooking though sometimes I get something to eat in cheap coffee-houses
BTS These are merely a few of the things that went through my mind and are related for the sake of vindicating myself in advance in the weak and helpless role I was destined to play
BTS He had killed man the noblest game of all and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang
BTS I lay back against Ernest in the automobile and with apathetic eyes watched the soldiers trying to get the machine out of the city
BTS Their ribs is like wash-boards an' their stomachs is right up against their backbones
BTS The continual brutality around me was degenerative in its effect
BTS The resulting wreck tied the line up for days
BTS Then White Fang struck
BTS He started for the companion-way and stepped forward quite as I had been accustomed to see him do
BTS Then the sheet gave with greater ease and Wolf Larsen was beside me heaving in alone while I was busied taking up the slack
BTS For that matter the strength of the Revolution during these frightful twenty years has resided in nothing else than the sense of righteousness
BTS But when I came to make the bed I found between the blankets dropped apparently as he had sunk off to sleep a complete Browning the Cambridge Edition
BTS And so according to the clay of his nature and the pressure of his surroundings his character was being moulded into a certain particular shape
BTS Not a word that Bishop Morehouse had uttered was in print
BTS I shrank back from my own conclusions
BTS Nilson was standing at the wheel and the Cockney's hurtling body struck his legs
BTS Just as I contended right along
BTS What'd I want to kick 'm for
BTS The bow plunged down just missing me and sending a swash of water clear over my head
BTS Certainly among my many new trades I shone least as a sail-maker
BTS Also this live thing was meat
BTS I had lost my watch and had no idea of the time
BTS He was gone eight hours and he came back through the darkness hungrier than when he had started
BTS The boat lost headway and as we lifted on a huge surge toppled and fell into the trough
BTS Not only was his body tired with the adventures it had undergone but his little brain was equally tired
BTS But we've come to it now
BTS However I am aching for a chance to kill you so go ahead and cut
BTS The people knelt upon the ground with awe
BTS The dogs were drawn apart the bull-dog struggling vigorously
BTS They're not our comrades he shouted in my ear
BTS It was quite similar to the one I had witnessed in the cabin
BTS Out of necessity we had to punish our traitors
BTS The fog was gone and in its place the sun sparkled crisply on the surface of the water I turned to the east where I knew California must lie but could see nothing save low-lying fog-banks the same fog doubtless that had brought about the disaster to the Martinez and placed me in my present situation
BTS A hundred was the reply
BTS On every side was the silence pressing upon them with a tangible presence
BTS Also the dogs ate one another and also the gods ate the dogs
BTS You are very kind I am sure she murmured
BTS The war was declared off and the populations of both countries returned to their tasks
BTS Not that Buck reasoned it out
BTS What then does the United States get in return from Brazil
BTS He hasn't a chance in ten thousand
BTS But you'll do
BTS This book continued to be secretly printed throughout the three centuries of the Iron Heel
BTS Back we held two miles and more to windward of the struggling cockle-shell when the flying jib was run down and the schooner hove to
BTS And then that night it rained and she was flooded out and driven back into the boat
BTS In consequence his forearm was ripped open to the bone
BTS while his brain thrust all awry by the unwonted stimulant permitted him to go any length to obtain it
BTS The pain was too great
BTS And on the morrow I awoke to find in myself a longing to see him again
BTS If you were really great really true to yourself you would join forces with Leach and Johnson
BTS one of the men asked
BTS but it was without power
BTS Kill me
BTS The others betrayed a well-mannered interest and urged Ernest for a statement of his views
BTS And what I say to you is true of all of you at this table
BTS They were taught and later they in turn taught that what they were doing was right
BTS The hand continued slowly to descend while he crouched beneath it eyeing it malignantly his snarl growing shorter and shorter as with quickening breath it approached its culmination
BTS He took to standing for long periods with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply
BTS The encouragement Buck gave the rebels led them into all kinds of petty misdemeanors
BTS The workingmen on the street railway furnish the labor
BTS They made the clothes but they shiver in rags and ask you the lawyer or business agent who handles your money for a job
BTS From the bull's side just forward of the flank protruded a feathered arrow-end which accounted for his savageness
BTS White Fang knew the meaning of home and though he did not understand the remainder of the master's language he knew it was his will that he should go home
BTS There was something about the slope of the shoulders and the fringe of silver hair between coat collar and slouch hat that aroused vague memories
BTS and White Fang's snarl slowly dwindled to a growl that ebbed down in his throat and ceased
BTS Sacredam
BTS They were seeing it then as they sat there and they were frightened by it
BTS She nodded her head
BTS Kobe was a shambles
BTS Some of the men were already departing
BTS Hartman gripped my arm and dragged me into a wide entrance
BTS In the meantime we would be doing our own work largely unhampered and gaining control of all the machinery of society
BTS Beauty Smith strode into camp and stood over White Fang
BTS Still she waited and looked at me
BTS At first she caressed the cub and licked his wounded shoulder
BTS We would be saved so much trouble if you did
BTS That was fair of Francois he decided and the half-breed began his rise in Buck's estimation
BTS This exploit was particularly gratifying to the three men
BTS but my heart was aching for the youth of him and I felt that I must either scream or burst into tears
BTS Then you separate sincerity from truth
BTS Outside the regular secret service of the Iron Heel there was further established a secret service of the Mercenaries this latter forming a connecting link between the police and the military
BTS When he ventured to run abreast of the older wolf which was seldom a snarl and a snap sent him back even with the shoulder again
BTS Get along home
BTS cried the other
BTS First there has been no need to enforce it
BTS Besides he was learning how to get along with Grey Beaver
BTS This time Wolf Larsen's command was thrillingly imperative
BTS But his case was deferred to next day principally for the reason that I did not know anything about broken ribs and would first have to read it up
BTS I cried trying to free my arm without hurting her
BTS that the sight and sense and touch of the loved one's hair was as much breath and voice and essence of the spirit as the light that shone from the eyes and the thoughts that fell from the lips
BTS So sleepily helpless was I that she was compelled to hold me in my chair to prevent my being flung to the floor by the violent pitching of the schooner
BTS And now if the gods be truly kind we shall drift by that next headland and come upon a perfectly sheltered beach where we may land without wetting our feet
BTS Labor is dreadfully underpaid
BTS and he's worth it or I'm a squarehead
BTS Billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night
BTS Haw
BTS She shook her head and gazed at me pitifully
BTS Time and again he fought it out with Leach who fought back always like a wildcat tooth and nail and fist until stretched exhausted or unconscious on the deck
BTS A shower of rain drove down upon us each drop stinging like a hailstone
BTS Kind of evened up the score a bit
BTS His chance for election was most favorable
BTS Yet the warm blood of the rabbit tasted good in his mouth
BTS He took the meat into his mouth and swallowed it
BTS And I have made a discovery
BTS This was the invidious distinction between them and the Sour-doughs who forsooth made their bread from sour-dough because they had no baking-powder
BTS His mother coming home growled as she smelt the wolverine's track and bounded into the cave and licked and nozzled him with undue vehemence of affection
BTS Smoke's mates were now smiling broadly
BTS But with such a powerful combination as the Oligarchy and the big unions is there any reason to believe that the Revolution will ever triumph
BTS Mush on there
BTS But the mystery and oppressiveness vanished after the first few seconds of waking when I identified the missing something as the wind
BTS Furthermore it was remarkably easy to overthrow a dog taken by surprise
BTS as is the good so is the sinner
BTS My father was a good man Ernest once said to me
BTS It shrouded Chicago in mystery and it suggested to the average Chicago reader that the Oligarchy did not dare give the local news
BTS He was ever a graceful man diplomatic tactful and considerate
BTS He saw Spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing
BTS But it was all needless
BTS He seemed pleased when I nodded my head with the customary Yes sir
BTS It made him frantic
BTS ' When he says 'free opportunity for all' he means free opportunity to squeeze profits which freedom of opportunity is now denied him by the great trusts
BTS It is for my child that I cry
BTS And by doing nothing they tied their war-lord's hands
BTS and this be the sign of it
BTS My youth has nothing to do with what I have enunciated
BTS To gam among the sealing-schooners is a substitute for the verbs to visit to gossip
BTS I set the breakfast-table in the cabin and at seven o'clock waited on the hunters and officers
BTS And here lying by the river bank through the long spring days watching the running water listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature Buck slowly won back his strength
BTS Then while some broke camp others harnessed the dogs and they were under way an hour or so before the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn
BTS A second and smaller sled was driven by Mit-sah and to this was harnessed a team of puppies
BTS It is a Titan's task
BTS It was in such a storm and the worst that we had experienced that I cast a weary glance to leeward not in quest of anything but more from the weariness of facing the elemental strife and in mute appeal almost to the wrathful powers to cease and let us be
BTS the blind fought the blind
BTS They came to him without effort or discovery as though they had been his always
BTS Both from his father the wolf and from Kiche he had inherited stature and strength and already he was measuring up alongside the full-grown dogs
BTS It is a base and unwarranted assumption
BTS But she proceeded to punish him roundly until he gave over all attempts at placation and whirled in a circle his head away from her his shoulders receiving the punishment of her teeth
BTS Tied securely White Fang could only rage futilely and endure the punishment
BTS I often doubt I often doubt the worthwhileness of reason
BTS We did try to organize but independent dairymen always broke through us
BTS I saw a hand shoot up to clasp his
BTS The aim of life was meat
BTS This is intolerable
BTS Skeet and Nig were too good-natured for quarrelling besides they belonged to John Thornton
BTS He also was addicted to crowding her to veering toward her till his scarred muzzle touched her body or shoulder or neck
BTS Is it because you have no answer
BTS There I encountered Maud
BTS There were still several hours of grey daylight and sombre twilight and he utilised them in chopping an enormous supply of fire-wood
BTS and with a deal of exertion got it on deck and into the boat
BTS You're quite an individual
BTS What do you make of those things
BTS It was caused by his trying to save the company a few dollars
BTS It was uncanny
BTS In splendor and in light the Pope passed home
BTS I shook my head saying Something has happened to him
BTS His grey eyes seemed metallic and steel-like as they flashed upon the crowd
BTS Thus it was with White Fang
BTS The jungle and the wilderness lurked in the uplift and downput of his feet
BTS Insult in its very nature is emotional
BTS It never seemed to me that she walked or at least walked after the ordinary manner of mortals
BTS I'm busy
BTS I don't see how I am to teach you I made protest
BTS The man-animals were gods unmistakable and unescapable
BTS Wickson was right
BTS And it is equally true that so long as you and yours and those that come after you have power that labor shall remain in the dirt
BTS Oh yes they did do something
BTS He turned brusquely away from us and began to question the new men
BTS And always he had a sharp and covetous eye for White Fang
BTS One of these was fidelity
BTS It was a pain and an unrest
BTS It was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears
BTS I therefore say to the rich among you that it is their duty to do what I have done and am doing
BTS Two years hence every office will be ours from the President down to the local dog-catcher
BTS He reached hastily for a brand to throw at her
BTS So he turned tail philosophically and trotted on up the stream
BTS To be cast away on an island had not entered into my calculations so we were without a kettle or cooking utensils of any sort
BTS Here was no meat nothing but a threatening and inedible silence
BTS and the Wild aims always to destroy movement
BTS it is the nearest I dare approximate it
BTS There were not even cabs on the streets
BTS With the exception of the huge bulks of the skin-lodges little could be seen save the flames of the fire broken by the movements of intervening bodies and the smoke rising slowly on the quiet air
BTS Slip it was my answer
BTS When I knocked the shackle-bolt loose the chain roared out through the hawse-hole and into the sea
BTS In the fall of the year when the first snows were falling and mush-ice was running in the river Beauty Smith took passage for himself and White Fang on a steamboat bound up the Yukon to Dawson
BTS I had backed away from him almost weeping at my inability to shoot him but not fool enough to put down the gun
BTS It had taken Cherokee a long time to shift that grip upward and this had also tended further to clog his jaws with fur and skin-fold
BTS But the work was going on everywhere
BTS We had been loafing along till now our sails shaking half the time and spilling the wind
BTS They complained
BTS Of the two of us you and I who is the greater coward
BTS I repeated the question
BTS I have heard of such things
BTS That you will not say Please please' too often
BTS They all'll be here in the mornin' hunkydory
BTS You see I was a creature of environment and at that time had strong class instincts
BTS He roared in a ferocious animal-like way and gave me a shove with his hand
BTS Kowalt spoke up
BTS Even they were frightened not at the boy's terrible words but at his terrible audacity
BTS I ran in close and struck another blow hitting the shoulder instead of the head
BTS They don't want the machines destroyed
BTS She looked me bravely in the eyes
BTS The Preacher found life and the works of life all a vanity and vexation an evil thing
BTS The dead man was an episode that was past an incident that was dropped in a canvas covering with a sack of coal while the ship sped along and her work went on
BTS Strike me blind if this ayn't gratitude for yer
BTS Squirrels were chattering birds singing and overhead honked the wild-fowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the air
BTS There was for me no strangeness to it to the rough clothes the coarse faces the wild laughter and the lurching cabin walls and swaying sea-lamps
BTS As night drew on the clouds darkened and the wind freshened so that when Maud and I ate supper it was with our mittens on and with me still steering and eating morsels between puffs
BTS and he saw me depart with such evident relief that I should have laughed had not my heart been so full of tears
BTS I cried out
BTS The big eat the little that they may continue to move the strong eat the weak that they may retain their strength
BTS This is sold abroad
BTS A sudden frightful expression distorted his well-bred face
BTS All right
BTS Yes sir was the meek reply as the offending head disappeared into the galley
BTS And what have you to say
BTS To the top of the foremast which was just lifted conveniently from the deck I attached the rigging stays and throat and peak halyards
BTS Sometimes they chanced upon other wolves usually in pairs
BTS Clear that raffle I answered pointing to the tangled wreckage overside
BTS He was not homesick
BTS The dogs never stopped
BTS I asked
BTS I've got my rights he whimpered
BTS Likewise he was made dizzy by this abrupt and tremendous extension of space
BTS The light had become painfully bright
BTS But it is the way of the metaphysicians and I forgive you
BTS Regardless of his bulging muscles and prize-fighter's throat he impressed me as an ingenuous boy
BTS others were long-legged too long
BTS and as I caught her arm to help her down the companion stairs I was startled by its smallness and softness
BTS You found that you were and that the men you talked with were
BTS I noticed the anxious light in Johnson's eyes but mistook it for the native shyness and embarrassment of the man
BTS My memory flashed back to that first thin little volume on my desk and I saw before me as though in the concrete the row of thin little volumes on my library shelf
BTS Thornton went on whittling
BTS She was strangely stirred and sniffed and sniffed with an increasing delight
BTS With full stomachs bickering and quarrelling began among the younger males and this continued through the few days that followed before the breaking-up of the pack
BTS And by that same method of reasoning the inductive method philosophy fuses all particular sciences into one great science
BTS From his mother he had inherited the heavier proportions of the dog so that he weighed without any fat and without an ounce of superfluous flesh over ninety pounds
BTS Your father
BTS Beginning here as though regretting her parsimony Nature had spread his features with a lavish hand
BTS It is very simple
BTS There you have it Hump he said closing the book upon his finger and looking up at me
BTS They looked at each other as they started to rise to their feet
BTS He could not follow for before his nose leaped the merciless fanged terror that would not let him go
BTS I contested myself with the fore crosstrees some seventy feet above the deck
BTS Oh well I don't mind telling you he said the next moment
BTS He may desire to escape pain or to enjoy pleasure
BTS How did you get wet
BTS When the two vessels were half-a-mile apart a third shot made another hole in our mainsail
BTS Immediately I classified him--a sort of prodigy I thought a Blind Tom of the working class
BTS His gaze and his hand-clasp grew firmer and steadier if that were possible
BTS We were working over him however when he signed for paper and pencil
BTS but I was not in the mood to have it forgotten
BTS He noticed my movement
BTS The terrible sea the frail boat the storms the suffering the strangeness and isolation of the situation all that should have frightened a robust woman seemed to make no impression upon her who had known life only in its most sheltered and consummately artificial aspects and who was herself all fire and dew and mist sublimated spirit all that was soft and tender and clinging in woman
BTS His face suddenly softened and he opened his watch and showed me a small photograph of a woman and two little girls pasted inside the case
BTS If it did it would not have any deposits in the savings banks
BTS If one of em' turns up missin' I'll go without my coffee
BTS and such was the curiousness of the game the way of life for one lay in the eating of the other and the way of life for the other lay in being not eaten
BTS He could feel a new stir in the land
BTS This hurt
BTS Do you still hear
BTS And as though answering my unspoken thought he wailed I never 'ad no chance not 'arf a chance
BTS Insidiously and by remote ways as well as by the power of stick and stone and clout of hand were the shackles of White Fang's bondage being riveted upon him
BTS An' 'tis with wonder I'm filled as to the workin' out iv things
BTS The stables were reached and there in the doorway lay Collie a half-dozen pudgy puppies playing about her in the sun
BTS Hans paid out the rope permitting no slack while Pete kept it clear of coils
BTS But when White Fang stopped without orders then it was allowed them to spring upon him and destroy him if they could
BTS Furthermore from the very beginning of the capitalist system capital has never consumed all of its share
BTS He couldn't a-done it himself that's sure
BTS It has been the law for years for nine years gentlemen
BTS The banks themselves constituting one of the most important forces of the Oligarchy continued to call in credits
BTS White Fang was awed
BTS It turns me sick even now when I think of it
BTS The morning of the fourth day found the wind diminished to a gentle whisper the sea dying down and the sun shining upon us
BTS Still nothing happened
BTS Never mind the exceptions and never mind the oppression and injustice in which the Iron Heel was conceived
BTS And it shall be done by power
BTS nor could it express itself in terms of itself
BTS His throat was afflicted by rigid spasms his mouth opened and in a heart-broken cry bubbled up his loneliness and fear his grief for Kiche all his past sorrows and miseries as well as his apprehension of sufferings and dangers to come
BTS There will be more of it
BTS In fact this oiliness or greasiness as I was later to learn was probably the most salient expression of his personality
BTS it's life
BTS Another great institution that had taken form and was working smoothly was the Mercenaries
BTS and when the strike-breakers were worsted by the labor unions the troops always appeared and crushed the unions
BTS A laboratory experiment was no experiment if it were not carried through in all its details
BTS Stealing backward glances as he ran he was always ready to whirl around and down the overzealous pursuer that outran his fellows
BTS Wants to know what has become of you and I don't know how to tell him
BTS This day was the very day of the explosion
BTS and here one afternoon I was drowsing half asleep over a volume of Mendenhall
BTS Let us go on
BTS I near died of the scurvy and was rotten with it six months in Barbadoes
BTS His eyes ceased to see visions
BTS In the full glare of the afternoon light crouching in the entrance of the cave the cub saw the lynx-mother
BTS she asked in a strained tense voice
BTS But he was still only a part-grown puppy and stronger than the call either of man or of the Wild was the call of his mother
BTS Eat 'm up
BTS His eyelids drooped and went shut and his whole body seemed to relax and flatten out upon the floor
BTS And I had not left the deck until three
BTS On your life don't stumble and go down
BTS Your error is that you failed to expect the worst
BTS From his book entitled The Battles of Labor is quoted the declaration that in some of the great historic strikes the employers themselves have instigated acts of violence
BTS The courts are in the hands of the trusts
BTS The footprint was much larger than the one his own feet made and he knew that in the wake of such a trail there was little meat for him
BTS He made overtures to White Fang from the first
BTS The Kanaka leaped backward to his bunk to return with a second leap flourishing a long knife
BTS He did not know what a fall was
BTS He rose to his feet and laughed awkwardly
BTS Yet it went deeper
BTS At four o'clock he executed a running jump gained the roof of the chicken-house and leaped to the ground outside whence he sauntered gravely to the house
BTS Asmunsen said
BTS but I knew she was wrong and I wondered if she likewise knew
BTS only you've got me where you want me
BTS I glanced at father and I was afraid he was going to giggle at the effect of this human bombshell he had been guilty of launching amongst us
BTS I call you metaphysicians because you reason metaphysically Ernest went on
BTS When I do not think of what is to come I think of what has been and is no more--my Eagle beating with tireless wings the void soaring toward what was ever his sun the flaming ideal of human freedom
BTS Also the wives and families of the traitors were ostracized while the corner groceryman who sold provisions to them was boycotted
BTS Most of us came in
BTS and the very conventionality of her tones and words with the host of associations it aroused of the old life on the other side of the world gave me a quick thrill rich with remembrance but stinging sharp with home-sickness
BTS Henry grunted with an intonation that was not all sympathy and for a quarter of an hour they sat on in silence Henry staring at the fire and Bill at the circle of eyes that burned in the darkness just beyond the firelight
BTS I am eating them now and you too
BTS I lifted the trap in the floor but for some moments gazed dubiously into the darkness of the lazarette beneath
BTS Ernest demanded
BTS Poor simple folk Ernest said to me in an undertone
BTS I noticed though that whenever one looked tired and lagged she let it slip past
BTS The savings bank deposit is simply a piece of the loaf put back on the shelf to be eaten next day
BTS On it came bellowing with brute rage
BTS From my fuller knowledge of the creature I now know that the posture was unconscious
BTS Next morning after breakfast Thomas Mugridge began his whet whet whet
BTS The mast was stepped
BTS On the sidewalk they were liable to have their skulls crushed by bricks and cobblestones thrown from windows and house-tops
BTS As he moved about or raised his arms the great muscles leapt and moved under the satiny skin
BTS They were not prepared for his swiftness and directness for his attack without warning
BTS I was ignorant of the simplest duties of mate and would have fared badly indeed had the sailors not sympathized with me
BTS No window
BTS He shifted his grip in a bit
BTS Dreams must be more substantial and satisfying
BTS He arose and began in a few well-chosen phrases that carried an undertone of faint irony to introduce Ernest
BTS Nineteen years have elapsed and despite our untiring efforts we have failed to find the man who really did throw the bomb
BTS As for myself I was in a daze
BTS But there were two other hands I answered
BTS I questioned eagerly
BTS Lost they indubitably were
BTS Simultaneously with the destruction of the Grangers came the revolt of the coal miners
BTS So out of the unpractical idea of profit-sharing arose the practical idea of grab-sharing
BTS That club was a revelation
BTS When he broke through into the ring Beauty Smith was just in the act of delivering another kick
BTS With condescension he accepted their condescension
BTS It was only a foot and a half long and in my superb ignorance I never dreamed that the club used ashore when raiding the rookeries measured four to five feet
BTS You never made anything in your own sweat
BTS His body wrapped limply about the fist like a wet rag about a stick
BTS And for two hours we sat there face to face whet whet whet till the news of it spread abroad and half the ship's company was crowding the galley doors to see the sight
BTS after that and only after that are their spirits ready for more refined nourishment
BTS I'll wager Dr
BTS The wolves were rushing him
BTS But there was one thing that he never outgrew his growling
BTS You are shivering now
BTS I could row no more
BTS but as it descended it slowly twisted so that square would not fit into square
BTS In Sacramento the capital of California the Grangers had succeeded in maintaining order
BTS I reeled away from him and leaned against the cabin in a half-fainting condition
BTS One foot also he held up after the manner of a dog
BTS So the cub had no quarrel with his hostile environment
BTS Van Weyden he said
BTS The overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead Buck and his mates struggling frantically under the rain of blows
BTS And ever the light grew brighter
BTS Then he smelled the strange fabric saturated with the man-smell
BTS Then they turned to White Fang
BTS Well you won't abide here long I can tell you
BTS well I wasn't my own boss any more
BTS As he turned his agonized face up to me I recognized him as Joseph Hurd
BTS Van Weyden good-night
BTS But a still greater cunning lurked in the recesses of the Indian mind
BTS The hunter had managed to get the boat before the wind again but we ran down upon it going at least two feet to its one
BTS Later in the day he chanced upon another stray chicken near the stables
BTS What do you think of him
BTS Wells was a sociological seer sane and normal as well as warm human
BTS She nodded emphatically
BTS Another famous organization of women was The Widows of War
BTS and though the meat was proffered to him with short inviting thrusts of the hand he refused to touch it
BTS Her joy at finding him seemed even greater than his joy at being found
BTS she cried
BTS They quickened the old life within him and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks
BTS Dr
BTS Owen affirmed with a complacent smile
BTS He'll bite
BTS The courts were in the hands of their enemies
BTS Danger lurked in contacts
BTS At the end of an hour the single and double blocks came together at the top of the shears
BTS She made no acknowledgment
BTS Very true Mr
BTS Financed by surplus capital from Standard Oil Ernest said
BTS but she was still hoisting the jib when I put the wheel hard down
BTS And the howling folly of it is that we are so helpless that such idiots really are managing our interests was Ernest's comment
BTS They sowed wind and wind and ever more wind
BTS Thus I was given to understand that he was the captain the Old Man in the cook's vernacular the individual whom I must interview and put to the trouble of somehow getting me ashore
BTS A few years ago we dairymen had everything our own way
BTS All of them would spring upon the hated leader only to find the tables turned
BTS The boat drew closer and closer hurling along through the seething green like a thing alive lifting and sending and uptossing across the huge-backed breakers or disappearing behind them only to rush into sight again and shoot skyward
BTS Asmunsen nodded
BTS For an immeasurable period lapped in the rippling of placid centuries I enjoyed and pondered my tremendous flight
BTS a bloody lie
BTS He kept awaking and cocking his ears at the bright world without where the April sun was blazing across the snow
BTS In the fortresses
BTS Then on one side and the other she ran along the base of the wall to where its abrupt bulk merged from the softer-lined landscape
BTS White Fang still danced on dodging and doubling leaping in and out and ever inflicting damage
BTS It reminded me of the great hoot-owl listening after its booming cry for the stir of its frightened prey
BTS When I say 'you' I mean the superintendent and the officials that you and the other stockholders pay to manage the mills for you
BTS The heritage was too compelling for a wolf that was only a cub
BTS The jib was rising
BTS He was making some sort of rattan-work and he toiled on stolidly while I talked with him
BTS The red-faced man had said that the tide was ebbing through the Golden Gate
BTS Then he broke loose
BTS But White Fang was unaware of it
BTS Well he said
BTS The indecisiveness or feebleness of his movements was more pronounced
BTS The houseman is very kind but he must have his rent
BTS But such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society
BTS But nobody else ever romped with White Fang
BTS It had long since passed into the stage where blows were required to rouse it
BTS It was the crucial moment
BTS And there's that broken oar ready to hand
BTS It was no light running now nor record time but heavy toil each day with a heavy load behind
BTS The quarter-strain of dog he had inherited from Kiche had left no mark on him physically though it had played its part in his mental make-up
BTS He was astonished
BTS but I confess my heart was in my mouth as I thought of going through the heart of that monstrous herd
BTS In the favored unions are the flower of the American workingmen
BTS I cut 'im in ribbons that's wot I did an' 'e a-squealin' all the time
BTS And between this and the smells arising from various pots boiling and bubbling on the galley fire I was in haste to get out into the fresh air
BTS Mercy was a thing reserved for gentler climes
BTS His face was anxious as was the face of my companion who had stumped over to the rail and was gazing with a like intentness in the direction of the invisible danger
BTS Mugridge had heard the Kanaka's warning cry and was screaming madly
BTS But that men should wreak their anger on others by the bruising of the flesh and the letting of blood was something strangely and fearfully new to me
BTS nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that direction as in the direction of Charles's political prejudices
BTS Yes it has been a bad summer
BTS But I must do these men justice
BTS We sprang together for the ladder but I raced past her to the deck
BTS Be a bad dog and I'll whale the stuffin' outa you
BTS This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun that there is one event unto all
BTS he groaned and the clenched fists were raised again to the infinite despair with which his throat vibrated
BTS Yep has fits the man said hiding his mangled hand from the baggageman who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle
BTS Hammerfield was never up against anything like it in his life he laughed
BTS My face was against his chest and I could not see but I heard Maud turn and run swiftly away along the deck
BTS The women were afraid
BTS Sometimes and rarely he managed to get his feet to the earth and for a moment to brace himself against White Fang
BTS He accompanied her joyfully about the camp
BTS Van Weyden will you take the wheel
BTS But I do not accept his estimate
BTS Supper was ready and Wolf Larsen and Maud were waiting for me
BTS I wish we could get some of it for the propaganda Ernest said wistfully
BTS thrust his loneliness more forcibly upon him
BTS He lay where he had fallen and from there he watched the man in the red sweater
BTS And still we stood the pair of us staring at each other
BTS This produced the desired effect
BTS I wanted to become a naturalist he explained shyly as though confessing a weakness
BTS Quite as though it had been a long-established custom of his he struck out with all his legs and began to swim
BTS And yet it does seem clear as print
BTS A moisture came into his eyes and as the whipping continued he arose and walked irresolutely up and down
BTS No life stirred
BTS Leach never changed his position on the edge of the bunk
BTS He was hanging by them head downward
BTS From a cache behind a hollow rotting log my companion brought out a variety of things--a fifty-pound sack of flour tinned foods of all sorts cooking utensils blankets a canvas tarpaulin books and writing material a great bundle of letters a five-gallon can of kerosene an oil stove and last and most important a large coil of stout rope
BTS I was struck a crushing stunning blow nowhere in particular and yet everywhere
BTS You wear the warm clothes
BTS Colonel Ingram had ingloriously bolted overturning a palm in his flight
BTS now
BTS And yet it was in precisely this way that he was treated
BTS In the past he had observed Lip-lip's persecution of White Fang
BTS The hand was jerked back and the teeth came together emptily with a sharp click
BTS but he preferred to eat what he killed himself
BTS Dr
BTS A whitecap foamed above it and broke across in a snow-white smother
BTS Each fall when the Yeehats follow the movement of the moose there is a certain valley which they never enter
BTS I felt myself a match for the most ferocious bull in the herd and I know had such a bull charged upon me that I should have met it unflinchingly and quite coolly and I know that I should have killed it
BTS '  In those days groups of predatory individuals controlled all the means of transportation and for the use of same levied toll upon the public
BTS Then was added to the uproar the cub's shrill yelp of pain and fright
BTS Grey Beaver picked up the paddle
BTS He was knocked off his feet
BTS You must go aboard Humphrey and find out she said
BTS The cabin-boy and he weighed one hundred and sixty-five at the very least crumpled up
BTS The night was a repetition of the night before save that the need for sleep was becoming overpowering
BTS He obeyed the impulse but was checked by the master's voice
BTS So it was arranged when I was released at the end of six months that I was to disappear and prepare a secure hiding-place for Ernest
BTS Ballingford looked pained then he brightened up and said Granted this horrible picture you have drawn yet you must confess that metaphysics was inherently potent in so far as it drew humanity out of this dark period and on into the illumination of the succeeding centuries
BTS The mountains and waste regions were filled with outlaws and refugees who were being hunted down mercilessly
BTS And still we lived and the boat lived and the wind blew unabated
BTS What are we going to have
BTS So had the other man Johnson
BTS Again Buck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory
BTS Then labor has received in wages during the same period two billion dollars
BTS The cook drew himself up in a smugly humble fashion a deprecating smirk on his face
BTS Oh she's a-comin'
BTS Then I realized that he was preparing to heave to and dropped to the deck to be in readiness
BTS And they made themselves many inventions I began merrily then paused to sniff the air
BTS Later on when I was an international spy I should have been less clumsy I am sure
BTS I knew every inch of the way
BTS At six feet the panicky thought rushed into my mind What if he will not run
BTS On board the schooner the boat-pullers and steerers are the crew
BTS As a sample of the decisions of the courts adverse to labor the following instances are given
BTS I was abnormal an emotionless monster a strange bookish creature capable of pleasuring in sensations only of the mind
BTS The maintopmast was over thirty feet in length the foretopmast nearly thirty and it was of these that I intended making the shears
BTS I'd let me soul an' body burn in everlastin' hell for them children of mine was his answer
BTS Calvin said tartly
BTS He walked boldly about the camp inflicting punishment in the night for what he had suffered in the day
BTS Besides you know we can't hurt Johnson's soul
BTS My voice sounds faint and far
BTS And in the dirt it shall remain so long as I and mine and those that come after us have the power
BTS Van Weyden
BTS It had no hair protection
BTS And so with the Oligarchy
BTS And so I was kept in touch with all that was happening in the world without
BTS His father he had already come to recognise his father as the one other dweller in the world a creature like his mother who slept near the light and was a bringer of meat his father had a way of walking right into the white far wall and disappearing
BTS Cooky cannot hurt you
BTS He hesitated while he groped in his vocabulary and framed a complete answer
BTS This was dead in our teeth but I took in the sea-anchor and set sail hauling a course on the wind which took us in a south-south-easterly direction
BTS As a result driven back upon themselves from every side the traitors and their families became clannish
BTS You've only got three cartridges an' there's no tellin' what might happen
BTS Calvin work all your nights and days to organize the farmers along with the rest of the middle class into a new political party
BTS Sometimes she whirled with him
BTS It's all right for you 'Ump
BTS and though he listened through long vigils the mournful howl was never raised
BTS As he did so a draught of air fanned him and a large winged body swept ominously and silently past
BTS Again the rope was attached and he was launched and again he struck out but this time straight into the stream
BTS Because of all this he became possessed of a great pride in himself which communicated itself like a contagion to his physical being
BTS And I observed also that his whole body had unconsciously drawn itself together tense and alert
BTS He waited until he was sure of striking before the squirrel could gain a tree-refuge
BTS At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front
BTS and there were times when a single dog scored deeply on him
BTS Nor was he executed by the comrades as is commonly supposed
BTS His shoulders relaxed and drooping and his head on his knees advertised that he had given up the struggle
BTS To all appearances he looked like a dog that had been strangled to death
BTS When the sled started he floundered in the soft snow alongside the beaten trail attacking Sol-leks with his teeth rushing against him and trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side striving to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled and all the while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain
BTS Beyond his snuggling and the throwing of a crooning note into his love-growl he had no way of expressing his love
BTS Once they came upon a path blazed through the forest an ancient path and the Lost Cabin seemed very near
BTS At last organized labor had learned its lesson
BTS Presently John D
BTS They learned that it was when a steamer first tied to the bank that they had their fun
BTS I scarcely dared look at her just then for the fear of betraying myself
BTS I found none clean noble and alive though I found many who were alive--with rottenness
BTS But the hopelessness of it I protested
BTS That is a question you must settle with Mr
BTS Conventional or habitual values meant nothing to him
BTS He swam directly to the beach and clambered out into a small opening between two harems the masters of which made warning noises but did not attack him
BTS The camp-sounds came to his ears
BTS This was Francois's speech next morning when he discovered Spitz missing and Buck covered with wounds
BTS By eleven o'clock the sea had become glass
BTS And after that  She looked at me queerly
BTS The air was vibrant with things happening and impending
BTS well done
BTS I ask you to prove it to yourself
BTS Here Colonel Van Gilbert writhed in his chair
BTS There are not enough soup-kitchens and bread-lines to go around you know and when men have nothing in their purses they usually die and die miserably unless they are able to fill their purses pretty speedily
BTS His world was gloomy
BTS His life flickered out in the storm I said
BTS There was no suggestion of form in the utter blackness
BTS Then an old wolf gaunt and battle-scarred came forward
BTS The next day we waited and the next and still he made no sign
BTS Van Weyden Wolf Larsen said the following morning at the breakfast-table How do things look
BTS a laugh that was as rough and harsh and frank as the sea itself
BTS But Wolf Larsen was the man-type the masculine and almost a god in his perfectness
BTS She has broken down at last I thought
BTS The driver was perplexed
BTS I had seen the boat-steerers and hunters set their spritsails many times yet this was my first attempt
BTS Too late One Ear learned his mistake
BTS Possibly I recited with a certain joyous lilt which was my own for his memory was good and at a second rendering very often the first he made a quatrain his own he recited the same lines and invested them with an unrest and passionate revolt that was well-nigh convincing
BTS Owen answered
BTS But his curiosity was rampant and several minutes later he was venturing forth on a new quest
BTS yet the boats lowered day after day were swallowed up in the grey obscurity and were seen no more till nightfall and often not till long after when they would creep in like sea-wraiths one by one out of the grey
BTS Maud was all this to me an unfailing source of strength and courage
BTS You have left the real and solid earth and are up in the air with a word for a flying machine
BTS All but White Fang was averse to friendship
BTS Here he comes now she whispered
BTS I was groping into his soul-stuff as he made a practice of groping in the soul-stuff of others
BTS One crawled through tight-locked briers and branches and found oneself on the very edge peering out and down through a green screen
BTS Grey Beaver again made him fast with a thong and in the morning turned him over to Beauty Smith
BTS Many young men fled into the mountains to escape serving in the militia
BTS The hard times
BTS Hump if you will look on the west coast of the map of Norway you will see an indentation called Romsdal Fiord
BTS Darkness was coming on and for a while he played about among the trees pleasuring in his freedom
BTS Maud looked at me and I understood
BTS That was on the second day
BTS They growled and barked like detestable dogs mewed and flapped their arms and crowed
BTS I am disgusted with you gentlemen members of my class
BTS 'You hardly behave as if your purse had been touched she said smilingly
BTS And as this idea of fulfilling Wolf Larsen's order persisted in my dazed consciousness I seemed to see him standing at the wheel in the midst of the wild welter pitting his will against the will of the storm and defying it
BTS Confess now in warning me for my own good that you are very consistent
BTS I began as a little lad on the spindles
BTS It affected their minds as the many atmospheres of deep water affect the body of the diver
BTS Hunger he had known
BTS In the afternoon Smoke and Henderson fell foul of each other and a fusillade of shots came up from the steerage followed by a stampede of the other four hunters for the deck
BTS They follow my track by the clouds above O'er the fathomless tropic blue
BTS Since you are not yet case-hardened tell me what you think right now about the general editorial policy
BTS We ran down the flying jib hauled the jib-sheets to wind-ward and the main-sheet flat and came up into the wind
BTS How could his answers be damaging if he had the right on his side
BTS She seemed to smile at him showing her teeth in an ingratiating rather than a menacing way
BTS I'll wager they've made a text-book out of his 'Benevolent Feudalism
BTS Henry called after him
BTS No there is nothing left for us but the open boat I iterated stoutly
BTS White Fang snarled at the sound of his voice but this time did not leap away from under the hand that was caressing his head and the back of his neck with long soothing strokes
BTS Colonel Van Gilbert became known as Snarling Van Gilbert
BTS You do not like me
BTS And because of all this he carried himself more boldly with a touch of defiance that was new in him
BTS And of course you will all keep my secret
BTS Why don't you change the basis of your coinage then
BTS So clearly could one see canon gorge and precipice and the shadows that lie therein that one looked unconsciously for the white surf-line and bellowing caverns where the sea charges on the land
BTS I noticed they grinned with satisfaction whenever they looked at the Macedonia's smoke which was rising higher and higher as she approached from the west
BTS They worked for wages
BTS Jordan's book I believe
BTS But he fooled the others just as he had fooled Miss Brentwood
BTS Thomas Mugridge routed me out at half-past five much in the fashion that Bill Sykes must have routed out his dog
BTS Oh one of them crackerjack minin' experts
BTS The pitch to which he was aroused was tremendous
BTS It seemed likely to bear fruit
BTS Of course he answered you took into consideration the audience to which it was addressed
BTS Exasperation and anger were flushing the face of Dr
BTS We refuse to perish
BTS Seven of your thin little volumes are on my shelves
BTS And unconsciously this way and that he glanced for avenues of escape
BTS He'll have to go back for the rest of his boats
BTS The motor-centres too I suggested
BTS There was a strong smell of pine and subtle wood fragrances filled the air reminding him of his old life of freedom before the days of his bondage
BTS If you will wait please until I come back I answered
BTS I'll go out the back
BTS Unsafe as was his present position he was loath to forsake it for the more unsafe position on the halyards
BTS Ask Captain Larsen I answered composedly and coldly though inwardly my blood was boiling at the thought that she should be witness to such brutality
BTS Obedience rigid undeviating obedience was what was exacted of him
BTS Father in fact was delighted
BTS There was much in other matters for White Fang to learn
BTS And furthermore such was the strangeness of it White Fang experienced an unaccountable sensation of pleasure as the hand rubbed back and forth
BTS her large eyes larger than usual what of the purpose in them looked penetratingly into mine
BTS She smiled at me whimsically gloriously and I knew there was no need for forgiveness
BTS Was I then being carried out to sea
BTS One of the pleasant and axiomatic fictions they have created is that they are superior to the rest of mankind in wisdom and efficiency
BTS When I tried to pin him down to what my home life had to do with swerving the university from its high ideal he offered me a two years' vacation on full pay in Europe for recreation and research
BTS He shook his head
BTS He don't like the old man no more nor you or me
BTS Automatically his eyes were adjusting themselves to the brightness focusing themselves to meet the increased distance of objects
BTS The face with large features and strong lines of the square order yet well filled out was apparently massive at first sight
BTS Life itself is unsatisfaction but to look ahead to death is greater unsatisfaction
BTS We cannot fail
BTS She was like a bit of Dresden china and I was continually impressed with what I may call her fragility
BTS Lip-lip was White Fang's own kind and being only a puppy did not seem dangerous
BTS I finished my work and had opened the door to leave when he spoke to me
BTS but Ernest like the rest of his comrades was working for assurances from the labor leaders that they would call out their men in the next general strike
BTS every movement of a muscle from the heave of the shoulders to the tightening of the lips about the cigar was decisive and seemed to come out of a strength that was excessive and overwhelming
BTS We were surveying the completed seal-skin roof
BTS It followed down after him pressing more closely against him
BTS I'll bushwhack her as sure as my name is Bill
BTS They are glazing
BTS It was like the grip of death
BTS The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip
BTS and so it was that he exalted what he deemed his mortality
BTS Not permitted himself to run with the pack the curious state of affairs obtained that no member of the pack could run outside the pack
BTS You have eyes you have seen I answered almost brutally what of the pain and fear at my own heart
BTS I felt proud of myself as we sat down to the table
BTS At the first cut of the whip White Fang left the chicken for the man
BTS Again I heaved it up to its old position for I had now another idea
BTS She flung it back with a sudden adroit movement and her face emerged smiling
BTS It was Wolf Larsen's last word bosh sceptical and invincible to the end
BTS And each year something happened and I did not go
BTS The strike had tied everything up so that nobody could work
BTS Oh I intend being very careful I answered
BTS No effort of faith is necessary to believe in such a god
BTS By the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation the sled was a quarter of a mile away
BTS They are strong hands
BTS Something is burning Maud said with sudden conviction
BTS And third he must act for the benefit of his race
BTS His face and neck were hidden beneath a black beard intershot with grey which would have been stiff and bushy had it not been limp and draggled and dripping with water
BTS Still the punishment delayed
BTS In which case we were another hundred and fifty miles to the bad
BTS He had just destroyed little live things
BTS Each time that she reappeared was a miracle
BTS Besides I shall do the clubbing
BTS The newspapers in 1902 of that era credited the president of the Anthracite Coal Trust George F
BTS the dog-musher exclaimed at supper one night
BTS The automobile containing the officer who had asked the question darted on
BTS Smoke who had descended to the deck and was now standing by my side began to chuckle in a significant way
BTS The man who travelled loud-stepping the direct line to the cabin door he let alone though he watched him vigilantly until the door opened and he received the endorsement of the master
BTS I scarcely know where to begin
BTS I was aware of a pent stifled feeling
BTS The man's as contrary as air currents or water currents
BTS And she had been steering seven hours
BTS But that is equivalent to one hundred and forty-four miles in twenty-four hours I added reassuringly
BTS Something terrible is going to happen in Chicago she said
BTS Don't deny it
BTS Maud had finished her task and come aft where she stood beside me a small cap perched on her wind-blown hair her cheeks flushed from exertion her eyes wide and bright with the excitement her nostrils quivering to the rush and bite of the fresh salt air
BTS It moved with commingled mistrust and daring cautiously observing the men its attention fixed on the dogs
BTS He sorrowed too loudly and woke up Grey Beaver who beat him
BTS It is a parasitic growth that battens on the capitalist class
BTS Always when hardest pressed for food he found something to kill
BTS Apt scholar that he was they were equally apt teachers never allowing him to linger long in error and enforcing their teaching with their sharp teeth
BTS I wonder I wonder I repeated pacing up and down
BTS The papers were filled with tales of violence and blood
BTS Kelly ripped up a bottom board and began paddling but dropped it with a cry of pain as its splinters drove into his hands
BTS They had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit these dogs that were ill-tamed wolves
BTS Ernest proceeded with his attack
BTS Human kindness was like a sun shining upon him and he flourished like a flower planted in good soil
BTS It was a wistfulness bred of hunger as cruel as its own fangs as merciless as the frost itself
BTS Served 'm right
BTS She clumsily hinted as much when she invited me
BTS Buck heard them go and raised his head to see Pike was leading Sol-leks was at the wheel and between were Joe and Teek
BTS And now breakfast
BTS Look sharp or you'll get doused was Mr
BTS Do you think so
BTS He did not reason the question out in this man fashion
BTS An' dat Buck fight lak two hells was Francois's answer
BTS At night camp was made
BTS How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment
BTS but to them in turn it had been passed down through all the generations of wolves that had gone before
BTS I was interested as to which quatrain he would like best and was not surprised when he hit upon the one born of an instant's irritability and quite at variance with the Persian's complacent philosophy and genial code of life What without asking hither hurried Whence
BTS I'd rather disappoint you he laughed and turned on his heel and went aft
BTS All this was a matter of development and took time
BTS The difference between you and the Eskimo who makes a fur-clad blubber-eating god is merely a difference of several thousand years of ascertained facts
BTS In part the decision read There is no reasonable ground for interfering with the liberty of persons or the right of free contract by determining the hours of labor in the occupation of a baker
BTS The country would never have permitted it
BTS but you can depend upon it that blessed brother of mine has twigged our little game and is just a-humping for us
BTS They've half got you a'ready a-talkin' like that Henry retorted sharply
BTS Then stay with us and discuss it
BTS the great mass of the people still persisted in the belief that they ruled the country by virtue of their ballots
BTS Three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour making a total of nine and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Canon
BTS Maud was trembling
BTS And when he put the wheel hard over and the Ghost's bow swung off there was nothing for the hunters to do but obey and make the best of a risky chance
BTS No matter what their fighting experience they had never encountered a dog that moved so swiftly as he
BTS Such boldness on the part of a man of my own class would have been almost unforgivable
BTS And even Billee the good-natured was less good-natured and whined not half so placatingly as in former days
BTS You said yourself that he'd done right
BTS And what does that mean
BTS Her task was to hold the boat in position while I worked at the tangle
BTS Salmon Tongue's hand reached out to him and rolled him over on his back
BTS The cub felt his mother wilting at the sound
BTS If you paid advertising rates you couldn't get any such matter into the papers
BTS Thinkin' what
BTS Beauty Smith his hands still behind him began to back away
BTS There were many persons to be considered
BTS Thus we were in both camps at the same time ostensibly serving the Iron Heel and secretly working with all our might for the Cause
BTS Nearer and nearer it came
BTS He was afraid that Thornton would pass out of his life as Perrault and Francois and the Scotch half-breed had passed out
BTS Take a turn
BTS you feel their mailed hands descending upon your profits and taking a pinch here and a pinch there--the railroad trust the oil trust the steel trust the coal trust
BTS Its apex might be likened to a point
BTS It had flung its hated rival out of the world-market and enabled us to dispose of our surplus in that market
BTS Yes even perhaps she acknowledged
BTS The first to go was Dub
BTS The children of the traitors were persecuted by the children of the workers who had been betrayed until it was impossible for the former to play on the streets or to attend the public schools
BTS The pilot-boat plunged past
BTS All day he ran
BTS I was never so nauseated in my life with overplus of fallacy
BTS Scott you can't break 'm apart that way Matt said at last
BTS But it was only for a moment
BTS Altogether we'll have our hands full if we find the island uninhabited
BTS I did not know it but I had slept the clock around and it was night again
BTS So I say the work was never done
BTS Farley and his gang will be promoted to slave-driving
BTS The cook made repeated journeys to his bunk for money
BTS I am all here and more than here
BTS I can hear him now with that war-note in his voice flaying them with his facts each fact a lash that stung and stung again
BTS Purpose does not explain that
BTS As Lip-lip invariably won he enjoyed it hugely
BTS Discipline was relaxed among the Mercenaries that remained while many regiments had been withdrawn and sent to various parts of the country
BTS Then the circle would lie down again and here and there a wolf would resume its broken nap
BTS And at any rate our sort of machine-breaking is at least practical and possible which your dream is not
BTS But he circled just beyond the range of the club snarling with bitterness and rage
BTS He achieved a staidness and calmness and philosophic tolerance
BTS A few years later this would have been impossible because the passport system was to become so perfect that no man woman nor child in all the land was unregistered and unaccounted for in his or her movements
BTS said Matt in an awe-stricken voice
BTS Both men were manifestly out of place and why such as they should adventure the North is part of the mystery of things that passes understanding
BTS But he braced himself to the shock of Spitz's charge then joined the flight out on the lake
BTS And he was never averse to another encounter
BTS These were trapped by the Indians for the purpose and a fight between White Fang and a wolf was always sure to draw a crowd
BTS Well
BTS Have you read him
BTS I sprang upon him blindly insanely and drove the knife into his shoulder
BTS My whole world was turning over
BTS In the labor troubles of the first decade of the twentieth century A
BTS SOCIETY is here used in a restricted sense a common usage of the times to denote the gilded drones that did no labor but only glutted themselves at the honey-vats of the workers
BTS Nor was my knee any better
BTS And this out of all remains I did not fail
BTS the man cried again this time with sharpness and authority
BTS One more question
BTS He pointed out of the window
BTS And I confess that I became afraid very much afraid
BTS I don't know my own mind and that's what's the trouble
BTS but this time Maud made no suggestion of turning back
BTS Her mouth opened the saliva drooled forth and she licked her chops with the pleasure of anticipation
BTS He had the wheel at the time and I went forward to my hospital in the forecastle where lay the two crippled men Nilson and Thomas Mugridge
BTS There on a hatch a large man was lying on his back
BTS Both he and Johnson would have killed Wolf Larsen at the slightest opportunity but the opportunity never came
BTS He oppressed the weak with a vengeance
BTS In those days thievery was incredibly prevalent
BTS Always I hear it saying 'I did it I did it
BTS In vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog
BTS The German socialists were ready to act with us
BTS and in my choice To reign is worth ambition though in hell Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven
BTS I looked at her closely and tried her with one of our signals
BTS He could not quite suppress a snarl but he made no offer to snap
BTS As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though Buck's hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest
BTS The life in me to-day is just as curious as it was in my boyhood and it's the being curious that makes life worth living
BTS These are essential traits of the wolf and the wild-dog when they have become domesticated and these traits White Fang possessed in unusual measure
BTS Fully five feet in length and standing two and one-half feet at the shoulder he far outweighed a wolf of corresponding size
BTS He had caught the contagion of the excitement and he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for John Thornton
BTS The second balloon was a failure
BTS But after a time he grew even to like the children
BTS I was directly under it
BTS Had Lip-lip not existed he would have passed his puppyhood with the other puppies and grown up more doglike and with more liking for dogs
BTS written by one Ambrose Bierce an avowed and confirmed misanthrope of the period Grapeshot n
BTS Always in the beginning before his conscious life dawned he had crawled toward the mouth of the cave
BTS This would not do for a draw-knife so he laid hold of the running part hove taut and made fast
BTS Now look here Mr
BTS The Speaker rapped for order and glanced expectantly at the officers in the doorways
BTS The sturdy skeleton of it remained
BTS He lay down to rest on the other side of the open near the edge of the bushes his tongue lolling out his chest heaving and panting his nose still hurting him and causing him to continue his whimper
BTS I know I said
BTS He had travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage car
BTS But have you thought of the other living things
BTS True and you will grant that capital would perish if there were no labor to earn the dividends
BTS Scott warned giving the final pry
BTS And we to-day looking back across the centuries can safely say that even had he lived the Second Revolt would not have been less calamitous in its outcome than it was
BTS Only those curious times could have given rise to the amazing spectacle of one Farley a notorious commander of strike-breakers who in 1906 swept across the United States in special trains from New York to San Francisco with an army of twenty-five hundred men fully armed and equipped to break a strike of the San Francisco street-car men
BTS I know sir was the answer
BTS Yesterday they evicted her
BTS My reason dictated that the beating Thomas Mugridge had received was an ill thing and yet for the life of me I could not prevent my soul joying in it
BTS No lazy sun-kissed life was this with nothing to do but loaf and be bored
BTS for the act in question that sent fifty-two Congressmen to prison was on a par with countless other acts committed by the oligarchs and before them by the capitalists
BTS Then our statements cancel each other Ernest said in a matter-of-fact tone and we are where we were
BTS His throat was bitten
BTS How clearly he thought and how well he expressed what he thought
BTS And I remember that the sounds they made reminded me of the squealing of pigs under the knife of the butcher and I was struck with horror at the vividness of the analogy
BTS Ah I smiled you advise me to kill neither him nor myself but to let him kill me
BTS He turned suddenly upon Ernest
BTS At Grey Beaver's heels he limped obediently through the village to the tepee
BTS He so warm in spirit was dominated by that cold and forbidding philosophy materialistic monism
BTS His trick was obvious
BTS It was I who was now favoured by a quick look
BTS What was it
BTS The solidarity of labor is assured and for the first time will there be an international revolution wide as the world is wide
BTS The unknown lurking in the midst of the sticks and moss was savagely clutching him by the nose
BTS He leaped in with a flash of fangs that ripped down the side of the mastiff's neck
BTS Ernest is a very remarkable young man and I'd rather see you his wife than the wife of Rockefeller himself or the King of England
BTS The breath was leaving his lungs and his chest was collapsing under my weight
BTS Three hundred dollars he answered
BTS He recognised One Ear's yell of pain and terror and he heard a wolf-cry that bespoke a stricken animal
BTS Yet that smoke which blinded me and made me cough and gasp must have a source
BTS My mate's gone and there'll be a lot of promotion
BTS I mean just that
BTS Spencer I remembered enough to know that altruism was imperative to his ideal of highest conduct
BTS In spite of the menacing hand the voice inspired confidence
BTS He laughed and it was the first time I had heard honest mirth in his voice
BTS He had been lying down in an abandon of comfort but he arose quickly and as the man arrived slid away in true wolf-fashion to the edge of the camp
BTS White Fang emerged from the car
BTS She leaned heavily against me and I do believe that she had fallen asleep again between the arm-chair and the state-room
BTS Get up there Buck
BTS I had cherished a hope that his victims would find an opportunity to escape while filling our water-barrels but Wolf Larsen had selected his spot well
BTS Fallacy upon fallacy
BTS Again he said and at length and with distressing detail that the Church had wandered away from the Master's teaching and that Mammon had been instated in the place of Christ
BTS There all young men must be in the army
BTS I'm thinking you're down in the mouth some Henry said
BTS My father
BTS I understood quite a good deal of First Principles but his Biology took the wind out of my sails and his Psychology left me butting around in the doldrums for many a day
BTS The Bishop was silent
BTS And while his eyes were still closed he had felt tasted and smelled
BTS There is no such law
BTS With a nervous shrinking paw One Eye stretched out the porcupine to its full length and turned it over on its back
BTS He was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn
BTS M
BTS It was more of a toy affair than anything else yet it was the delight of Mit-sah who felt that he was beginning to do a man's work in the world
BTS I may have learned to stand on my own legs I retorted
BTS Even so it was a hard fight and it aroused the last latent remnants of Buck's ferocity
BTS Night came but neither of us slept
BTS I cried
BTS What was the matter
BTS But to return to the people of the abyss
BTS For look you when I place a big contract the terms of which favor me a goodly profit the freight rate from my quarry to market is promptly raised
BTS Together they went down soldier and slave into the welter
BTS That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater and as Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the Narwhal it was the last he saw of the warm Southland
BTS Incidentally I may state that in my dual role I managed a few important things for the Revolution
BTS but prominent occupying most of the space was the long and narrow oblong box
BTS Hove to under this short canvas our decks were comparatively free of water while the Ghost bobbed and ducked amongst the combers like a cork
BTS The canvas flapped lazily
BTS Small wonder that I am restless
BTS I've a lover in Chicago she added apologetically
BTS Ay ay sir the helmsman responded putting a couple of spokes down
BTS Wickson did not send for father
BTS but to the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to crouch at man's feet this grief has never come
BTS the red-faced man stumping gallantly around on his artificial legs and buckling life-preservers on all comers
BTS Very true he replied
BTS Not for nothing had he surrendered himself body and soul to Grey Beaver
BTS White Fang was intelligent beyond the average of his kind
BTS His blood had not been paid for in order that a larger dividend might be paid
BTS But at front and rear unawed and indomitable toiled the two men who were not yet dead
BTS The spritsail filled with the wind suddenly careening the frail open craft till it seemed it would surely capsize
BTS A sinewy hand dripping with water was clutching the rail
BTS Why you'd not survive the night without blankets I know how strong you are
BTS First of all he had to learn the family of the master
BTS They were reeling apart
BTS while the puppies themselves were being broken in to the harness
BTS The grip was the thing and the grip he kept
BTS The feel of spring was in the air the feel of growing life under the snow of sap ascending in the trees of buds bursting the shackles of the frost
BTS Unless very likely there's an Irishman in your mother's woodpile
BTS I'll give you a thousand  I began but was interrupted
BTS Below the rapid was a second pool and here captured by the eddy he was gently borne to the bank and as gently deposited on a bed of gravel
BTS Then he returned and took up his burden
BTS You are Maud Brewster I said slowly and with certainty almost as though I were charging her with a crime
BTS With the exception of our little cove the other beaches sloped gently back for a distance of half-a-mile or so into what I might call rocky meadows with here and there patches of moss and tundra grass
BTS Thus at the first shock would the Iron Heel be brought to earth and lie practically dismembered
BTS All this was a spur to her pricking her to retaliation
BTS This little conference in our home was unofficial
BTS And leap by leap like some pale frost wraith the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead
BTS You and I are the only men on this ship who know its meaning
BTS And in that moment I knew that I loved him and that I was melting with desire to comfort him
BTS And d'ye hear that
BTS He left Sweden when he was eighteen is now thirty-eight and in all the intervening time has not been home once
BTS Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it
BTS I was sent for
BTS Before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of Curly he received another shock
BTS Violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly
BTS The streets were crowded with perils waggons carts automobiles
BTS For a time I listened to the clamour in the steerage and marvelled upon the love which had come to me
BTS Owen
BTS Who is it
BTS Under such circumstances I have never succeeded in getting the railroad to reconsider its raise
BTS Then he leaped back to his seat and the machine dashed on took the turn at the corner and was gone from sight
BTS He never forgot the hawk and its moving shadow always sent him crouching into the nearest thicket
BTS I followed her gaze but could see nothing unusual
BTS ' He was certainly serious--a twinge of ossified conscience or something
BTS They are practically unskilled labor
BTS But the she-wolf was very weak and sick
BTS Francois scratched his head again
BTS On the other hand the great helpless mass of the population the people of the abyss was sinking into a brutish apathy of content with misery
BTS But why didn't you
BTS With the introduction of machinery and the factory system in the latter part of the eighteenth century the great mass of the working people was separated from the land
BTS Also he was desperate
BTS Of course the newspapers made no mention of it
BTS You of the destroyed middle class along with labor--there will be nothing but labor then
BTS At sight of a sharp knife and a cowardly Cockney the clinging of life to life overcomes all your fond foolishness
BTS It was April and White Fang was a year old when he pulled into the home villages and was loosed from the harness by Mit-sah
BTS He began to sleep out at night staying away from camp for days at a time
BTS Down that flying jib Mr
BTS Eleven thousand men women and children were shot down on the streets of Sacramento or murdered in their houses
BTS How do I know they are not afraid
BTS My right cheek has been numb all day
BTS You know how to serve corporations and increase dividends by twisting the law
BTS for this man's body had become his mausoleum
BTS A cry arose that we were sinking
BTS No
BTS I was in New York when I received the order to proceed immediately to Chicago
BTS Ernest and I well understood before we left the refuge how the strength of the Iron Heel was developing
BTS He would lie by the hour eager alert at Thornton's feet looking up into his face dwelling upon it studying it following with keenest interest each fleeting expression every movement or change of feature
BTS When I first awoke it was night
BTS Into the Primitive Old longings nomadic leap Chafing at custom's chain
BTS CHAPTER II THE SOUTHLAND White Fang landed from the steamer in San Francisco
BTS His was a great soul and when my love grows unselfish my chiefest regret is that he is not here to witness to-morrow's dawn
BTS Tell me Ernest demanded what will you do when such a time comes
BTS that is no answer to the charge that your own face is dirty
BTS He it was who told me of the train that immediately preceded us
BTS Oh that first breath of air as we were dragged out
BTS Tamales are very good when the air grows chilly late at night
BTS Now Biedenbach after he left Glen Ellen had invented a most powerful explosive--expedite he called it
BTS Let me point out the power of but one of them the railroad group
BTS He was fighting tearing at a live thing that was striking at him
BTS The other nodded
BTS A new and incomprehensibly fairer life was dawning
BTS There were over five million of them many of them in the standing army and in addition they were on friendly terms with the labor unions
BTS The sea is the great faithless one
BTS Save that for dealing with your wage-slaves
BTS And strange Buck was to him for of the many Southland dogs he had known not one had shown up worthily in camp and on trail
BTS You will find him an interested listener and no fool
BTS I'll look away when  The danger is most serious I laughed
BTS He had recollected that there was such a thing in the world as his mother
BTS And not one of you to get a knife
BTS The Church is not teaching Christ these days Ernest put in quickly
BTS He had lessoned from Spitz and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail and knew there was no middle course
BTS Here then were these enormous sums in cash pouring in--more than 2000000 a month for John Davison Rockefeller alone
BTS He broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs
BTS The animal waddled toward the centre of the circle short and squat and ungainly
BTS I went once to his church
BTS After a time it became his occupation
BTS That's what I say Matt answered
BTS You are now on an unsubstantial basis
BTS Here was power
BTS Now don't say that this is what you get for bringing a woman along she said
BTS Stand by
BTS They contain more valuable political economy than is to be found in most of the books
BTS He heard the click of my pistol and laughed
BTS Spitz was equally willing
BTS He pondered a long time before replying
BTS The elder Pocock known as Pocock I
BTS Weedon Scott looked across at his companion with eyes that almost pleaded though this was given the lie by his words
BTS But the team did not get up at the command
BTS He has said that it is their intention to take away from us our governments our palaces and all our purpled ease
BTS But Canada crushed her own socialist revolution being aided in this by the Iron Heel
BTS Hammerfield said We do not mind the truth that is in any man
BTS Mercy
BTS He put a few spokes over and I watched the compass-card swing slowly to N
BTS But he caught my hand in a passionate grip one night saying I think yer square Mr
BTS It was as if he were saying farewell
BTS The increase in the younger generation of children who could not read nor write was perilous
BTS He was not satisfied and he continued to smell the air striving to understand the message borne upon it to him
BTS At the same time he flung the coil of rope
BTS White Fang scanned him apprehensively when he came out
BTS There is no such law
BTS Their code has been drummed into your head from the time you lisped and in spite of your philosophy and of what I have taught you it won't let you kill an unarmed unresisting man
BTS But now it was different
BTS One Ear strained the full length of the stick toward the intruder and whined with eagerness
BTS The next instant he had drawn up his legs and rolled clear
BTS an' there's so many of 'em that that didn't go far
BTS No
BTS Two of our boats with men all safe we took off the Cisco and to Wolf Larsen's huge delight and my own grief he culled Smoke with Nilson and Leach from the San Diego
BTS He ate heartily of the supper I cooked
BTS Our complaints were useless
BTS the Bishop cried
BTS In the days before White Fang had had the wisdom to cower down and submit to a man with a club in his hand
BTS Hoist in your boat he said to them
BTS The god had no club so he suffered him to approach quite near
BTS We haven't yet penetrated that far so we couldn't escape being kept in the dark
BTS Tyke 'im aw'y
BTS I am sure if I ever get home that I shall never be irritable with them again
BTS He has built too stoutly and too surely for that
BTS Then he saw Bill standing amid the dogs half triumphant half crestfallen in one hand a stout club in the other the tail and part of the body of a sun-cured salmon
BTS He avoided tight places and always backed out of it when they bade fair to surround him
BTS Hammerfield murmured complacently
BTS He had no experience of love
BTS Without any antecedent knowledge without any warning whatever that such existed he found himself an explorer in a totally new world
BTS The hand was dead
BTS Slowly cautiously it was unrolling its ball of impregnable armour
BTS and out of the courage of fear I evolved the plan of fighting Thomas Mugridge with his own weapons
BTS But it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it that Buck excelled
BTS Ain't a bit scairt of you Henry laughed
BTS This idea had been earlier advanced but not demonstrated by Sir Oliver Lodge and other students in the new field of radio-activity
BTS She waited
BTS The seven ptarmigan chicks and the baby weasel represented the sum of his killings
BTS They crisped and crackled like electric sparks
BTS Therefore your dogmatic assertions and rash generalizations on things historical and sociological are not worth the breath you waste on them
BTS He had essayed to walk along the trunk of a fallen pine
BTS This canard was circulated by the creatures of the Oligarchy
BTS Positively he was the most disgusting and loathsome person I have ever met
BTS in his address at Harvard Commencement We all know that as things actually are many of the most influential and most highly remunerated members of the Bar in every centre of wealth make it their special task to work out bold and ingenious schemes by which their wealthy clients individual or corporate can evade the laws which were made to regulate in the interests of the public the uses of great wealth
BTS Ernest was embarrassed and awkward
BTS Really Hump he is living deep and high
BTS Faithfulness and devotion things born of fire and roof were his
BTS Above the sky is stainless blue blue as the sea itself which under the forefoot is of the colour and sheen of azure satin
BTS He was magnificently terrible
BTS Mr
BTS He felt that the ill done White Fang was a debt incurred by man and that it must be paid
BTS It was the defiant cry of a mighty spirit
BTS As we drew nearer the firing ceased and we saw that the fight was over
BTS A block distant a hundred of our comrades had been holding a building
BTS Kiche
BTS Since the beginning of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles dragging sleds the whole weary distance
BTS a pale face lustreless gray eyes a metallic voice and a languid manner
BTS I was acquiring more confidence in myself and more confidence in the possibilities of windlasses shears and hoisting tackles
BTS A woman in fantastic rags with cheeks cavernously hollow and with narrow black eyes like burning gimlets caught a glimpse of Hartman and me
BTS I don't know I replied
BTS I came into his stormy life not as a new perturbing force but as one that made toward peace and repose
BTS It clinched his argument he contended
BTS I asked
BTS Furuseth was right
BTS When White Fang struggled Cherokee was content merely to hold on
BTS Concern showed in their faces and I noticed a tightening of lips
BTS It was as Matt had said
BTS Wolf Larsen and the lantern disappeared and we were left in darkness
BTS She was ten but she was very strong
BTS It was at this time that I was approached by Leach
BTS They did sir
BTS How is it that we have never heard of this law
BTS There won't be any more strikes
BTS Also he was blind blind as a bat
BTS Behind this lay our secret
BTS At any rate Mr
BTS He has told me so and I cannot dissuade him
BTS It was not long before they were reduced to a coma of hunger
BTS Understand
BTS And there won't be any unconsumed surplus because there won't be any profits
BTS The boat was caught as it obliquely crossed the crest of a wave
BTS It's all right mother Scott was saying as he kept tight hold of White Fang and placated him
BTS One only he saw a sleek gray fellow flattened against a gray dead limb so that he seemed a part of it a woody excrescence upon the wood itself
BTS Why not
BTS There was no sympathetic relation between his tail and his massive jaws
BTS How many books have been suppressed
BTS He took all manner of risks resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from dim dawn to dark
BTS It was on the verge of my tongue to ask if he were going to take the castaways into Yokohama
BTS The dog-musher paused and nodded his head confidentially at Moosehide Mountain
BTS Yes I answered
BTS she asked with pretty naive surprise
BTS It seems to me that all things of the mind are metaphysical
BTS His eyes fixed intently on the sea astern suddenly flashed
BTS so each morning early she slipped down and let him out before the family was awake
BTS though as Buck was afterward to learn each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition
BTS They were segregated in their own districts and beaten into submission
BTS While he lay in the bush recovering from his fright and peering fearfully out the mother-ptarmigan on the other side of the open space fluttered out of the ravaged nest
BTS The salary was comparatively large and would make safe our marriage
BTS Here were no seals whatever
BTS They were Maud's hands striving vainly to tear loose the hand that was throttling me
BTS ' And it says that all day long
BTS He was woefully changed
BTS The papers made no mention of the book but they misreported him beautifully
BTS This eagerness on their part was noted by Wolf Larsen with a grim smile
BTS Wolf Larsen barked a short laugh in my ear and strode away to the weather side of the poop
BTS Understand
BTS They were appalled by inaction and by the feel of something terrible impending
BTS He was the one little grey cub of the litter
BTS Even to the peeling of potatoes and the washing of dishes I answered to say nothing to wringing their necks out of very fellowship
BTS They impressed him as possessing superior power and it is on power that godhead rests
BTS Then the crowd was upon Buck and he was driven off
BTS Life had always seemed a peculiarly sacred thing but here it counted for nothing was a cipher in the arithmetic of commerce
BTS Gif it to heem the dirty t'eef
BTS Little discussion took place after this and the dinner soon broke up
BTS Down
BTS but he had come up with his back to it and the first thing his eyes rested upon was the opposite bank toward which he immediately began to swim
BTS Again Mr
BTS And yet outside of pain the only feeling I possessed was one of curiosity
BTS An' I'll bet it ain't far from five feet long
BTS You clean swindled Beauty Smith on top of pushin' his face in with your fist
BTS White Fang had come straight from the Wild where the weak perish early and shelter is vouchsafed to none
BTS You have called me snake tiger shark monster and Caliban
BTS They're gettin' anxious up there
BTS He would most probably shoot you
BTS I asked still holding his wrist
BTS From the Yukon arose the hoarse bellowing of a river steamboat
BTS They know only business
BTS Except for the final consummation the old order had passed away and the final consummation was nearer than I dreamed
BTS The courts were in the hands of the Plutocracy to carry the sentence out
BTS Before ever the thought of wonder cities like Ardis and Asgard entered the minds of the oligarchs Everhard saw those cities and the inevitable necessity for their creation
BTS I paused and smiled reassuringly at Maud for I had recovered my equanimity sooner than she
BTS You have not taken Bishop Berkeley into account
BTS This the Iron Heel foresaw and laid its schemes accordingly
BTS But still worse it seemed that his spirit was broken
BTS I find life precarious enough in my present humble situation
BTS Here are our hands
BTS I almost wish we'd sunk him the little rip
BTS less aspiring
BTS Home
BTS You are shivering
BTS And day by day are the merchants squeezed out in the same way
BTS White Fang followed closely at the master's heels
BTS ' 'I closed the cab door for you' I answered
BTS His intention was apparent enough
BTS He whirled over fetching the ground on his back and side
BTS G
BTS There was a sizzle and odour of burning flesh and a sharp cry of pain
BTS The months went by binding stronger and stronger the covenant between dog and man
BTS It bound his movements restricted his freedom
BTS And so we dodged about the deck hand in hand like a couple of children chased by a wicked ogre till Wolf Larsen evidently in disgust left the deck for the cabin
BTS They were angry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load
BTS How it happened was sufficient for him
BTS They had voiced a kindred intellect and spirit and as such I had received them into a camaraderie of the mind
BTS It was too much for me to witness
BTS James Farley--a notorious strike-breaker of the period
BTS The gods were ever crafty and they had unguessed ways of attaining their ends
BTS Plum tuckered out that's what's the matter
BTS White Fang's backers were correspondingly depressed and refused bets of ten to one and twenty to one though one man was rash enough to close a wager of fifty to one
BTS It was now half-past five and half-an-hour later when the last of the day lost itself in a dim and furious twilight I sighted a third boat
BTS The conversation at the table was of other things
BTS The defection of the great unions had prevented our proletarian revolt but violence was everywhere
BTS He had never experienced the hurt of a fall
BTS Hurd the great charity organizer
BTS We were too much alike in many things for argument
BTS It does me good
BTS I learned shorthand and typewriting and became his secretary
BTS But this socialism of yours is a dream Mr
BTS And the chief thing demanded by these intricacies of civilisation was control restraint a poise of self that was as delicate as the fluttering of gossamer wings and at the same time as rigid as steel
BTS Let me pause for a minute to look out over the sea sparkling in the sun or to gaze at a sailor going aloft to the gaff-topsails or running out the bowsprit and I am sure to hear the hateful voice 'Ere you 'Ump no sodgerin'
BTS It is dog eat dog and you ate them up
BTS A pack of bloodhounds followed the way of his bleeding feet
BTS And I was indeed thankful for I had by this time learned enough to know with all our canvas spread what disaster in such event awaited us
BTS For other men new in the land they felt nothing but disdain
BTS In addition to some small change and I have a good memory for such things it had contained one hundred and eighty-five dollars in gold and paper
BTS For a week she never left the cave except for water and then her movements were slow and painful
BTS Where does the power lie gentlemen
BTS As he went on his voice again grew soft and a confiding note came into it
BTS After some time of this the wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was going somewhere
BTS There's them that can't sail with better men like the hunters and them that don't know like the poor devils of wind-jammers for'ard there
BTS Kiche licked White Fang soothingly with her tongue and tried to prevail upon him to remain with her
BTS If they were of course all would be well
BTS This laughter was uproarious and scornful and at the same time the god pointed his finger derisively at White Fang
BTS Your twenty-four billions of wealth does not give you twenty-five cents' worth of governmental power
BTS Mr
BTS And Jim Hall on the other hand did not know that Judge Scott was merely ignorant
BTS We encountered it well up to the forty-fourth parallel in a raw and stormy sea across which the wind harried the fog-banks in eternal flight
BTS The man came back hurriedly
BTS And love was the plummet dropped down into the deeps of him where like had never gone
BTS At times these numbers swelled to over a million--without any account being taken of the hundreds of thousands of the labor castes and the artists
BTS I felt also that Maud and I had drawn more closely together
BTS Then the Church is dumb to-day as it was in the eighteenth century
BTS Then he discovered it
BTS Every word every cautious action on the part of the men impressed upon him his own terrible ferocity
BTS I sleep in cheap lodging houses the Bishop went on
BTS He must have suffered severely for he called me in and obeyed my commands like a sick child
BTS One small woman
BTS You haven't any lawyer or business agent now so you'll have to depend on yourself
BTS And so terribly did he live this vendetta that Grey Beaver fierce savage himself could not but marvel at White Fang's ferocity
BTS Because of his very great love he could not steal from this man but from any other man in any other camp he did not hesitate an instant
BTS Capital will not consume this balance because already according to its nature it has consumed all it can
BTS There was a nook on the bottom of the great hole where the sun shone for several hours and which was hidden from above
BTS Druther break cayuses any day and twice on Sundays was the reply of the driver as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses
BTS I obeyed and the two brutes picked up the senseless man like a sack of rubbish and hove him clear up the companion stairs through the narrow doorway and out on deck
BTS From the forest came the call or one note of it for the call was many noted distinct and definite as never before a long-drawn howl like yet unlike any noise made by husky dog
BTS And always he demanded facts and refused to discuss theories
BTS And in the meantime I may be permitted to love my son when his dog is not around she laughed though she was pale and weak from the fright
BTS He deserves all that can be done for him
BTS But we did not have to wait long and the problem solved itself
BTS He lay down in the snow depositing the ptarmigan beside him and with eyes peering through the needles of a low-growing spruce he watched the play of life before him the waiting lynx and the waiting porcupine each intent on life
BTS And sought in vain for any place of rest 'Foxes have holes and every bird its nest I only I must wander wearily And bruise my feet and drink wine salt with tears
BTS The firing ceased
BTS Well you can make up your mind to have it taken out of you on this craft
BTS What you need is rest and I should like you to remain and get it
BTS A thousand times no
BTS I had just finished sweeping the cabin and had been inveigled by Wolf Larsen into a discussion of Hamlet his favourite Shakespearian character when Johansen descended the companion stairs followed by Johnson
BTS Still continued the journey of Grey Beaver
BTS And on the last night of the second week they topped White Pass and dropped down the sea slope with the lights of Skaguay and of the shipping at their feet
BTS It squirmed about like some huge many-legged spider and swayed back and forth to the regular roll of the vessel
BTS The lazarette was directly beneath the cabin and opening the trap-door in the floor and carrying a candle with me I dropped down and began overhauling the ship's stores
BTS And White Fang allowed himself to be driven away
BTS It was quite a scramble down to the stream bed and once on the bed we went down stream perhaps for a hundred feet
BTS At the next crossing several similar smoke pillars were rising skyward in the direction of the West Side
BTS I felt endowed with a sudden strength
BTS The whole Water Front Federation along with its allies in the structural trades had backed up the teamsters and all had been smashed down ingloriously
BTS He smiled his twisted smile and Maud her eyes wide with horror was compelled to turn away her head
BTS Once again he lived in the lair with Kiche crept trembling to the knees of Grey Beaver to tender his allegiance ran for his life before Lip-lip and all the howling bedlam of the puppy-pack
BTS We captured the state legislature of Oregon and put through splendid protective legislation and it was vetoed by the governor who was a creature of the trusts
BTS It was like a spirit message such as are delivered at seances of spiritualists for a dollar admission
BTS He flung himself upon another and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own throat
BTS Because you are stronger I managed to blurt out
BTS Body and brain his was a more perfected mechanism
BTS Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down
BTS It was well that it was arranged for by evening his voice had gone from him
BTS You can depend upon it that they're holding them like this thirty or forty miles outside the city on every road
BTS CHAPTER V But my first night in the hunters' steerage was also my last
BTS Perhaps some new devilry of the gods was about to be perpetrated on him
BTS It marked his adaptability his capacity to adjust himself to changing conditions the lack of which would have meant swift and terrible death
BTS But there was one lesson the dogs did learn and that was to keep together
BTS White Fang knew this point
BTS How we socialists worked to hold them back
BTS I hardly think that is fair was the objection
BTS They went down the valley of the stream far beyond White Fang's widest ranging until they came to the end of the valley where the stream ran into the Mackenzie River
BTS You said so yourself Mr
BTS Never mind your bedding
BTS These men about me should have wives and sisters and daughters
BTS That it is unfortunate especially if you have any engagements falling due in the course of the next several months
BTS I remembered Wolf Larsen's caution
BTS History was making fast
BTS White Fang leaped clear and as the man struggled to rise was in again with the slashing fangs
BTS And thus without speech we waited the end
BTS What can be done with it
BTS He dropped his head to the scale and resumed the copying
BTS The coming of daylight dispelled his fears but increased his loneliness
BTS The cook who was called the doctor by the crew Tommy by the hunters and Cooky by Wolf Larsen was a changed person
BTS The other four men glued their eyes on their plates and chewed steadily and with thoughtful precision their ears moving and wobbling in time with their jaws like the ears of so many animals
BTS He was aroused by her snarling
BTS I don't think
BTS Van Weyden run aloft again and cut away any stray stuff on your way
BTS only there's seven of 'em again
BTS On the other hand we could not dream of allowing the young oligarch to depart
BTS It was beautiful spring weather but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it
BTS And the pang of new-born jealousy put all incredulity to flight
BTS I looked steadily into the cruel grey eyes
BTS Nevertheless White Fang was not quite satisfied with the arrangement
BTS Outside of that there is nothing mysterious
BTS It was not well
BTS Jock Horner and Smoke alone were unabashed stealing stealthy glances at her now and again and even taking part in the conversation
BTS He was simple direct afraid of nothing and he refused to waste time on conventional mannerisms
BTS You do not like me because I am too much of a man
BTS The distinction between being native born and foreign born was sharp and invidious in those days
BTS Ask one of those men
BTS They had not discovered simplicity of living
BTS Lip-lip might face the pack but he could not face that whip and all that was left him to do was to keep his long rope taut and his flanks ahead of the teeth of his mates
BTS Beside him even the venerable head of the university looked tawdry and small
BTS As I say I was not afraid to meet my own death there a few hundred yards to leeward
BTS he shouted hoarsely
BTS A rich man to-day who gives all he has to the poor is crazy
BTS But he was lost as completely as if the earth had swallowed him up and to this day no clew to his end has been discovered
BTS I spik true w'en I say dat Buck two devils
BTS It was an awkward mix-up
BTS This is worth investigatin'
BTS He was clad in a blue uniform and I remember noting how trim and quiet he was
BTS Still another time he stole into the steerage possessed himself of a loaded shot-gun and was making a rush for the deck with it when caught by Kerfoot and disarmed
BTS It had been a bloody strike
BTS It was done artfully
BTS Well Henry
BTS As I say he became well quite well and the newspapers and the church people hailed his return with joy
BTS Here you what are you up to
BTS My wrists and arms ached intolerably and though I had eaten heartily of a twelve-o'clock lunch I had worked so hard that I was faint from hunger
BTS CHAPTER XXX No wonder we called it Endeavour Island
BTS While waiting for me he had engaged Maud in animated discussion
BTS And behind all ever menacing was death violent and terrible
BTS In charging it to the public it was charged to the great mass of unorganized labor and of weakly organized labor
BTS I listened more closely
BTS Only you stick to your trade and I'll stick to mine
BTS I wanted to go through the university
BTS The broad pads of their feet were spread wide and in contact with the snow were like velvet
BTS Ah he had thought so
BTS Note the similarity between the utterance of the Charleston Baptist Association quoted above and the following utterance of Van Dyke seventy years later The Bible teaches that God owns the world
BTS There is no discussion Ernest answered
BTS The labor castes the Mercenaries and the great hordes of secret agents and police of various sorts were all pledged to the Oligarchy
BTS It meant merely more work to find them and tow them back
BTS But White Fang did it trotting away from the fort in the early morning with the end of the stick hanging to his neck
BTS It was almost dizzying in its effect
BTS One of them dare-devil launches he said
BTS He wore a ready-made suit of dark cloth that was ill adjusted to his body
BTS At last he spoke
BTS He swept me off my feet by the splendid invincible rush of him
BTS The Ghost clung on close to the wind and betrayed no inclination to fall off broadside to the trough
BTS Not at all
BTS We found that when labor had consumed to the full extent of its wages and when capital had consumed all it wanted there was still left an unconsumed surplus
BTS He asked no quarter gave none
BTS As I followed him I noted that in spite of rack and ruin a rough order obtained
BTS And as you say it may tempt for good as well as for evil
BTS She approached more cautiously and the cub had full opportunity to observe her lean snakelike body and her head erect eager and snake-like itself
BTS His eyes were closed and he was apparently unconscious
BTS His whole body was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort the muscles writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur
BTS This man a pillar of the church and heavy contributor to foreign missions worked his shop girls ten hours a day on a starvation wage and thereby directly encouraged prostitution
BTS Where's Maud
BTS Justice or injustice it was all the same he must take all things from the hands of his own gods
BTS I have listened carefully and there is only one name that will epitomize you
BTS And don't forget what I told you about temperature
BTS It could only buy back fifty dollars' worth
BTS And in return you preach to your employers the brands of metaphysics that are especially acceptable to them
BTS He struck out boldly but not straight enough into the stream
BTS How had he happened to be
BTS His eyes turned blood-shot and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend
BTS He hesitated awkward and bashful shifted his weight from one leg to the other then blunderingly gripped my hand in a hearty shake
BTS They could barely keep the traces taut and on the down grades just managed to keep out of the way of the sled
BTS One Eye was hungry
BTS He was doing it now vociferating bellowing waving his arms and cursing like a fiend and all because of a disagreement with another hunter as to whether a seal pup knew instinctively how to swim
BTS As Ernest said at the trial Does it stand to reason if I were going to throw a bomb that I should elect to throw a feeble little squib like the one that was thrown
BTS I saw him pulled aft to the cabin and noted with a shock of surprise that the galley had disappeared
BTS God
BTS There are signs of rampant bad temper in the steerage and the gossip is going around that Smoke and Henderson have had a fight
BTS He knew that he was doing the right thing by holding on and there came to him certain blissful thrills of satisfaction
BTS But it was not all easy for White Fang
BTS And each night when we come ashore in the boat Mr
BTS Unless you clip 'm in warm weather
BTS Nig equally friendly though less demonstrative was a huge black dog half bloodhound and half deerhound with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature
BTS Rendered curious by this new direction of ideas I talked with Johansen last night the first superfluous words with which he has favoured me since the voyage began
BTS The boat contained four men and its fifth occupant was certainly a woman
BTS The superiority of these man-animals increased with every moment
BTS Is it not true that that known as a trust produces more efficiently and cheaply than can a thousand competing small concerns
BTS Dr
BTS but so infinitesimal were the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous
BTS Landlordism would go crumbling
BTS They were shooting at us with one of the small cannon which rumour had said they carried on board
BTS I had been made love to by beardless sophomores and gray professors and by the athletes and the football giants
BTS All was unseen much was unguessed
BTS John Thornton was eating dinner when Buck dashed into camp and sprang upon him in a frenzy of affection overturning him scrambling upon him licking his face biting his hand playing the general tom-fool as John Thornton characterized it the while he shook Buck back and forth and cursed him lovingly
BTS and he had survived
BTS Perrault was in a hurry and he prided himself on his knowledge of ice which knowledge was indispensable for the fall ice was very thin and where there was swift water there was no ice at all
BTS He cowered down and snarled
BTS There are butterflies in the sunshine and from everywhere arises the drowsy hum of bees
BTS Several times he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs reading a message which made him leap on with greater speed
BTS It would never do he said decisively
BTS or days of drizzling rain when we filled our water-breakers from the drip of the wet sail
BTS Thus had White Fang never come in to the fires of man the Wild would have moulded him into a true wolf
BTS He came to the surface and the sweet air rushed into his open mouth
BTS But I am still here all here the hand scrawled more slowly and painfully than ever
BTS He has many desires
BTS Then I spoke frankly telling him what I was enduring from Thomas Mugridge because of the three days of favouritism which had been shown me
BTS I did my own work and my own work only and when and in what fashion I saw fit
BTS So he was harnessed in again and proudly he pulled as of old though more than once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt
BTS Since when have you become a philanthropist
BTS Buck laughed as dogs laugh yet kept his distance
BTS You forget the boat we found on the beach I reminded her
BTS Because he is the devil as I told you before was Leach's answer
BTS Even though the Pervaise confession had never come to light no reasonable doubt could obtain
BTS To me death had always been invested with solemnity and dignity
BTS So long as that were not interfered with they did not care what happened
BTS In the meantime Thomas Mugridge like a drowned rat was being dragged out from under the forecastle head where he had cravenly ensconced himself
BTS During that time we were never apart
BTS Certainly said Hal with freezing politeness taking hold of the gee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other
BTS Van W'yden but I do know I'll never rest 'appy till I see that 'ell-'ound bloody well dead
BTS Year by year it has been increased until to-day it is three hundred thousand
BTS A go I answered
BTS He it was that came up on the poop without orders and dragged Johnson forward where he set about dressing his wounds as well as he could and making him comfortable
BTS and I smiled as I saw a copy of The Dean's English
BTS As I have said there was never such a lover as he
BTS When he was very near I heard him crying in vexed fashion Why in hell don't you sing out
BTS Had there been food love-making and fighting would have gone on apace and the pack-formation would have been broken up
BTS As the Fighting Wolf he was known far and wide and the cage in which he was kept on the steam-boat's deck was usually surrounded by curious men
BTS 'Ow could it I s'y
BTS I lowered the gun and stepped to the corner of the cabin primarily to relieve the tension on my nerves and to make a new start and incidentally to be closer
BTS We are going to be throttled
BTS and spite of my resolutions I would have kissed the two dear hands had she not swiftly withdrawn them
BTS I queried
BTS But it's a dead shot
BTS I asked
BTS They did not bother to look after the causes of his conduct
BTS I never agreed with him in it and I disagree now as I write these lines more heartily than ever
BTS I had just finished tallying the skins of the last boat aboard when he came to my side in the darkness and said in a low tone Can you tell me Mr
BTS But there was no play about it
BTS and Ernest nodded
BTS She waited for me to go on
BTS A-beefin' and bellerin' 'round as though he'd kill you when he gets you
BTS People were struggling and floundering in the water about me
BTS And we intend to take not the mere wealth in the houses but all the sources of that wealth all the mines and railroads and factories and banks and stores
BTS For the pride of trace and trail was his and sick unto death he could not bear that another dog should do his work
BTS I have heard the sealers talk about clubbing them
BTS I'll do for you yet you slab-footed Swede I heard him say to Johansen one night on deck
BTS Otherwise I am in splendid condition feel that I am in splendid condition
BTS Our experience warranted this state of mind and we went about our work with anxiety always upon us
BTS A number of men however who were lounging about a companion-way between the galley and hatch and who did not seem to be sailors continued talking in low tones with one another
BTS You see the man from Missouri always says 'You've got to show me
BTS Thus did I receive my red baptism in that Chicago shambles
BTS There were deeps in his nature which had never been sounded
BTS Coming from no man knew where in the illimitable Pacific it was travelling north on its annual migration to the rookeries of Bering Sea
BTS Little did I dream the terrible road the Bishop was destined to travel--the Gethsemane and crucifixion that Ernest had pondered about
BTS It was at night
BTS Mr
BTS No woman was eligible for membership who had not lost near relatives at the hands of the Oligarchy
BTS He was daring destiny and he was unafraid
BTS White Fang was delighted with his mother's freedom
BTS You cannot honestly be in the two camps at once
BTS But they hastened it by overfeeding bringing the day nearer when underfeeding would commence
BTS And again the unprecedented was established
BTS It's damned tame whatever it is comin' in here at feedin' time an' gettin' its whack of fish
BTS Wolf Larsen was unconscious but it was a matter of minutes for the fresh air to restore him
BTS No matter what they want to do the sanction always comes
BTS It would be a most moral act to rid the world of such a monster
BTS He set sail and bore away into the west-north-west two hunters constantly at the mastheads and sweeping the sea with glasses himself pacing the deck like an angry lion
BTS I challenge you to answer
BTS He became quicker of movement than the other dogs swifter of foot craftier deadlier more lithe more lean with ironlike muscle and sinew more enduring more cruel more ferocious and more intelligent
BTS 'Oo I s'y
BTS The years were not many when the Yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves
BTS But to return to the earth the workingman being selfish wants all he can get in the division
BTS The puppy sprawled in front of him
BTS We are saved I said soberly and solemnly
BTS he demanded with a recrudescence of fierceness
BTS and in the bitter hatred between him and Spitz he betrayed no impatience shunned all offensive acts
BTS The Ghost for the moment was buried beneath the sea
BTS The one comrade Congressman we did not get was Arthur Simpson and he had already died in Cabanas after cruel tortures
BTS They would never get another rope around his neck
BTS He recollected something dropped the burden and trotted back to where he had left the ptarmigan
BTS And from then on Ernest pinned his faith in revolution
BTS White Fang was glad to acknowledge his lordship but it was a lordship based upon superior intelligence and brute strength
BTS He sprang to his feet waving his arms and for a moment could utter only incoherent sounds
BTS I made no complaint but Wolf Larsen demanded the most punctilious sea etiquette in my case far more than poor Johansen had ever received
BTS The table was not cleared
BTS White Fang endured it keeping his eyes fixed suspiciously not upon the man that patted him but upon the man that stood in the doorway
BTS It prepared to go on with its book publishing
BTS It recovered its old-time solidarity and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the traces
BTS Everhard
BTS and never in his long life had porcupine served him for a meal
BTS They were the most hopeless of all I had encountered in my quest
BTS Bah
BTS She too soared high but not so high as the quarry and her teeth clipped emptily together with a metallic snap
BTS We can deny him that satisfaction
BTS When among men fighting to the death in their wild-animal way a beaten man threw down his weapons it was at the option of the victor to slay him or spare him
BTS And I noticed the boyish face of Harrison a good face once but now a demon's convulsed with passion as he told the new-comers of the hell-ship they were in and shrieked curses upon the head of Wolf Larsen
BTS Brutality I had experienced but it was the brutality of the intellect the cutting sarcasm of Charley Furuseth the cruel epigrams and occasional harsh witticisms of the fellows at the Bibelot and the nasty remarks of some of the professors during my undergraduate days
BTS Yet he continued to fear and he stood on guard expectant of unguessed evil alternately suffering and enjoying as one feeling or the other came uppermost and swayed him
BTS Not so was it with the hunters
BTS What d'ye say
BTS At dinner he asked the hunters for a remedy for headache and by evening strong man that he was he was half-blind and reeling about the cabin
BTS Ernest cried
BTS Thrice he tried to knock him over then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg
BTS Holding him suspended with one hand with the other hand he proceeded to give him a beating
BTS he demanded
BTS Simple as A B C
BTS A sound among the dogs attracted the men's attention
BTS For the first time I thoroughly realized the extent of the task before us
BTS Orders were being given to clear the wheels of the war-machines
BTS My hands bothered me a great deal unused as they were to work
BTS Grey Beaver had intended camping that night on the far bank of the Mackenzie for it was in that direction that the hunting lay
BTS Many of the comrades were disheartened and they retaliated with terroristic tactics
BTS I do not believe in hell-fire and brimstone
BTS Oh the blessed sun
BTS Six cents for finishing
BTS At their backs rose a perpendicular wall of rock and Perrault and Francois were compelled to make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake itself
BTS Thank you he wrote
BTS A great awe descended upon him
BTS But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog
BTS Yer should 'a been born a gentleman an' never 'ad to work for yer livin'
BTS The display on both sides the quickness of the one and the steadiness of the other had excited the partisan spirit of the crowd and the men were making new bets and increasing original bets
BTS A modern hero
BTS Of the other two Bertha Stole disappeared twelve years later while Anna Roylston still lives and plays an increasingly important part in the Revolution
BTS It is true her mother was a dog
BTS It was the time of the famine and there was no meat for the dogs
BTS The Bishop discovered there was neither coal nor kindling and went out to buy some
BTS It was as though he had no brain
BTS And if we're not
BTS The tables were deserted and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see the outcome of the wager and to lay odds
BTS The farmers simply surrendered the land to the farm trust
BTS I'll have the law on you
BTS Here was no warm side of a tepee against which to snuggle
BTS He looked slowly about him and I saw the glint of laughter in his eyes
BTS But he laughs rarely
BTS Pig
BTS Carefully avoiding noise I lifted the trap-door in the floor and set it to one side
BTS Abandoned hastily was my conclusion as I ascended to the deck
BTS '  Oscar Wilde one of the lords of language of the nineteenth century of the Christian Era
BTS Utility does
BTS At sight of the crowd they stopped their dogs and came over and joined it curious to see the cause of the excitement
BTS But Buck turned about and started slowly on the back track
BTS Even the common laborers and all unorganized labor ceased work
BTS When Brazil under the capitalist system has developed her resources she will herself have an unconsumed surplus
BTS I charged the capitalist class with having mismanaged society
BTS We toiled hard and suffered greatly filled the gaps in our ranks and went on and through all the labour and the play and interplay of life and death we found time to laugh and love
BTS He was a graduate of the university had gone in for journalism and was then serving his apprenticeship as reporter on the most influential of the three newspapers
BTS Having established the point that the first African slaves were legally brought into bondage the right to detain their children in bondage follows as an indispensable consequence
BTS His face was quite expectant when I began my answer but you should have seen it when I finished
BTS Readily
BTS The occasional blows of sticks and stones he had previously experienced were as caresses compared with this
BTS She caught her breath and stammered I I thought I was given to understand that Yokohama was only a day's sail away
BTS By your own confession the trust machines do the work more efficiently and more cheaply than you can
BTS My knee is much better though it often aches for long periods and the stiffness is gradually leaving the arm which Wolf Larsen squeezed
BTS Back up the canyon from the lip of the hole all marks were likewise removed
BTS That man's name is Jackson Ernest said
BTS Because of this balance arises our need for a foreign market
BTS Look here the hunter Standish spoke to Wolf Larsen that's my boat-puller and I don't want to lose him
BTS Weedon nodded his head
BTS He was always keyed up alert for attack wary of being attacked with an eye for sudden and unexpected missiles prepared to act precipitately and coolly to leap in with a flash of teeth or to leap away with a menacing snarl
BTS Then he fought his teeth flashing in a snap that sank them into the hand
BTS she asked
BTS And not only that
BTS Am I what
BTS Don't take my word for it Ernest continued when the interruption had been led away
BTS I shall never be able to take pleasure in pretty gowns again I added
BTS The jaws opened with reluctance and Wolf Larsen stepped free
BTS The Bedlamites and the Helldamites were twin slave organizations while a new religious sect that did not flourish long was called The Wrath of God
BTS Without thinking about it he accepted this disappearing into the wall as a peculiarity of his father as milk and half-digested meat were peculiarities of his mother
BTS He held on to the wing and growled between his tight-clenched teeth
BTS His face was ghastly white twitching with suppressed pain
BTS I was afraid to turn my shoulder to him and when I left the galley I went out backwards to the amusement of the sailors and hunters who made a point of gathering in groups to witness my exit
BTS Then she fell to backing away and sneezing her nose bristling with quills like a monstrous pin-cushion
BTS And I felt as proud of my conception as if it were already a fact accomplished
BTS But in the face of it he was indomitable
BTS It was all very well for half a dozen wolves to drive a lynx spitting and bristling up a tree
BTS And though there was no reason in his brain for a clear conception of so abstract a thing as justice nevertheless in his own way he felt the justice of the man-animals and he knew them for what they were makers of law and executors of law
BTS Again I sniffed
BTS There was imperative need to be constantly alert
BTS On such occasions his elbows were on his knees his hands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms
BTS between the capitalists and the Western Federation of Miners similar but more bloody tactics were employed
BTS Thank you Mr
BTS No explanation is made
BTS The men you talked with--who were they
BTS After the first two or three strange dogs had been downed and destroyed the white men hustled their own animals back on board and wrecked savage vengeance on the offenders
BTS But it was a growl with a new note in it
BTS The gun was on the way to his shoulder but it never got there
BTS At half after five I went below to set the cabin table but I hardly knew what I did for my eyes and my brain were filled with the vision of a man white-faced and trembling comically like a bug clinging to the thrashing gaff
BTS and he stormed and raged at them through the bars
BTS This was a great relief and Buck caused even the weazened face of Perrault to twist itself into a grin one morning when Francois forgot the moccasins and Buck lay on his back his four feet waving appealingly in the air and refused to budge without them
BTS Good-morning to you
BTS But had he been merely wise he would not have gone back to Grey Beaver who had already twice betrayed him
BTS I looked at my watch
BTS Also he forgot to be afraid
BTS There was a death-struggle during which White Fang walked around stiff-legged and observant
BTS It was an improved crank windlass and the purchase it gave was enormous
BTS As they were descending they swept across a railroad directly over a troop-train that was heading at full speed for Chicago
BTS As I dragged the mattress out of the bunk it seemed to disintegrate in mid-air at the same time bursting into flames
BTS He captured the spy and as to what then happened Carlson gave us a fair idea
BTS His own kind included his mother and himself
BTS but he was too strong
BTS We were astonished at the ease with which the spar was lifted
BTS There were no beaches on the southern shore and by early afternoon we rounded the black promontory and completed the circumnavigation of the island
BTS Then the long black side of the vessel began slipping past so near that I could have touched it with my hands
BTS He knew more about fighting than did any of the dogs that faced him
BTS They could even see these forms move at times
BTS And yet I was conscious of a slight shock or hurt in that she was able to do the thing I had begged her to do and which she had notably disliked
BTS The snarling of his dogs was losing its efficacy
BTS I don't know what the Ghost would have been without you and if I could only cherish such noble sentiments I would tell you her master is deeply grateful
BTS Here and there Buck met Southland dogs but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed
BTS The members of the great labor castes were contented and worked on merrily
BTS But now alas how welcome would have been the feel of their presence the frou-frou and swish-swish of their skirts which I had so cordially detested
BTS What can we do
BTS I understand you have money or your father has which is the same thing--money invested in the Sierra Mills
BTS It was as though it had always been the wonted way of things
BTS Look at Major the other rejoined
BTS Ain't got all the way in yet
BTS that you have lifted it from the water swung it through the air and deposited it here where it belongs
BTS O the blazing tropic night when the wake's a welt of light That holds the hot sky tame And the steady forefoot snores through the planet-powdered floors Where the scared whale flukes in flame
BTS He had kept up exercise during the whole period of confinement and his muscles were like iron
BTS I felt quite stiff across the small of the back so much so that I straightened up with an effort and with pain
BTS They fought with their hands
BTS He was strolling leisurely along the poop on the port side
BTS So I was not altogether surprised when the squall foretold by Louis smote me
BTS There was no response
BTS I don't know whether I'll ever see you again
BTS Then he lay down with a contented grunt at the master's feet observing all that went on ever ready to spring to his feet and fight for life with the terrors he felt must lurk under the trap-roof of the dwelling
BTS Unless you've got friends about
BTS In the meantime the socialists held firm
BTS Everybody was excited and belligerent
BTS It was comparative a period of less misery slipped in between a past of great miseries and a future of great miseries
BTS At the conclusion of one such panic when he and Henry had got the dogs back in the traces Bill said I wisht they'd strike game somewheres an' go away an' leave us alone
BTS Sorry but I've lost the signal book overboard he remarked and the group of hunters grinned
BTS but this wisdom now left him
BTS You've got a right smart load as it is said one of them
BTS Wants all he can get
BTS Because of the low-roofed entrance the lynx could not leap in and when she made a crawling rush of it the she-wolf sprang upon her and pinned her down
BTS It was sultry and oppressive reminding me of what the old Californians term earthquake weather
BTS They had but to appear on deck at the same time when they would be at it cursing snarling striking
BTS Though he could not drown and was nine-lived in addition he was suffering all the agonies of half-drowning
BTS We do everything to make our guests feel at home eh Mr
BTS His lips moved and he gave voice to this enigmatic utterance A shilling's worth a quarter
BTS A week later Wickson got back his shoes
BTS Iron steel coal machinery and transportation constitute the backbone of the whole industrial fabric
BTS They spoke no more until camp was made
BTS Nor to this day can I permit my manhood to look back upon those events and feel entirely exonerated
BTS Hartman sprang in front of me
BTS By the time it was dark wind and sea had become too strong for the boat and I reluctantly took in the sail and set about making a drag or sea-anchor
BTS Keep your eye on Knowlton
BTS Johnson looked puzzled and embarrassed
BTS Pertonwaithe
BTS The soldier chuckled and the automobile sped on
BTS It was very natural that it should be there how natural I had not imagined until now when I looked upon it with her eyes and knew how strange it and all that went with it must appear to her
BTS Everhard is its prophet Dr
BTS He had used the phrase social revolution
BTS Chicago was the ripest of all--Chicago which of old time was the city of blood and which was to earn anew its name
BTS The effect was to ameliorate the too savage conditions of the fang-and-claw social struggle
BTS The result was that the Plutocracy found a greater surplus than ever on its hands
BTS The abbreviated leg looked as though the devil had there clutched for the Cockney's soul and missed the shadow for the substance
BTS I did some rapid thinking
BTS How can the Old World heroes compare with ours
BTS There could be but one ending
BTS I shall call you that name
BTS I felt that I could survive but a few minutes
BTS I can scarcely bring myself to realize that that great mast is really up and in
BTS It bit to the marrow
BTS Sitting on the deck several feet away and watching wistfully was White Fang
BTS From the protection of his god's body to the protection of his god's possessions was a step and this step he made
BTS A few Grangers who had been elected to Congress increased our strength and an elaborate programme of what was to be done was prepared by the united forces
BTS There is no difference except that we have eaten more and better
BTS If anything's going to run us down we couldn't get out of its way
BTS And here I must say a word for that gentle-souled terrorist than whom there is no comrade in the Revolution more fearfully misunderstood
BTS To Buck it was nothing new or strange this scene of old time
BTS The man early discovered White Fang's susceptibility to laughter and made it a point after painfully tricking him to laugh at him
BTS I cried
BTS If I speak not fast it is because I have not been from the old country as long as you
BTS and from one and all the answer will be that there is nothing congruous between the return to nature and socialism
BTS and during the intervening weeks he must have suffered greatly from loneliness
BTS Ernest laughed quickly
BTS He lay quietly where he had fallen
BTS He cast anxious glances at his mate but she showed no desire to get up
BTS He killed other dogs as easily as men killed mosquitoes
BTS but so alone was he that he did not dare to trust even me
BTS The Ghost was going very slowly and when her stern lifted on a wave and she slipped forward she pulled the wretch to the surface and gave him a moment in which to breathe
BTS But before I could guess what he had comprehended he had dropped the trap-door into place closing the lazarette
BTS but while a surgeon checked the bleeding he prowled up and down growling furiously attempting to rush in and being forced back by an array of hostile clubs
BTS All hands went over the side and there I was marooned on my own vessel
BTS We worshipped at the shrine of the Revolution which was the shrine of liberty
BTS and such a panic I now suffered
BTS At that moment the newcomer's fist landed a smashing blow full in his face
BTS But the cub saw and it was a warning and a lesson to him the swift downward swoop of the hawk the short skim of its body just above the ground the strike of its talons in the body of the ptarmigan the ptarmigan's squawk of agony and fright and the hawk's rush upward into the blue carrying the ptarmigan away with it
BTS Say nothin' but saw wood
BTS And yet love of freedom glowed sombrely and steadily in his dim soul
BTS But he neither snapped nor sprang away
BTS Their husbands you know are the two principal stockholders in the Mills
BTS CHAPTER XI The Ghost has attained the southernmost point of the arc she is describing across the Pacific and is already beginning to edge away to the west and north toward some lone island it is rumoured where she will fill her water-casks before proceeding to the season's hunt along the coast of Japan
BTS one's gone
BTS I never heard his other name
BTS The struggle then will be for the ownership of the machines
BTS They quarrelled and bickered more than ever among themselves till at times the camp was a howling bedlam
BTS he asked with the subservient smirk which comes only of generations of tip-seeking ancestors
BTS This passed away as the puppies' antics and mauling continued and he lay with half-shut patient eyes drowsing in the sun
BTS But White Fang was here there and everywhere always evading and eluding and always leaping in and slashing with his fangs and leaping out again in time to escape punishment
BTS The car had been to him no more than a room in a house and when he had entered it the city had been all around him
BTS his feet struck the deck squarely and with surety
BTS I was not wrong when I decided that his days had been spent on the sea
BTS but now and again appearing and disappearing amongst the underbrush and the scattered clumps of spruce could be seen One Ear
BTS I shouted when I thought it was meet to arouse Maud
BTS And the next moment I was aware that the thought was a treason against truth and Ernest rose before me transfigured the apostle of truth with shining brows and the fearlessness of one of Gods own angels battling for the truth and the right and battling for the succor of the poor and lonely and oppressed
BTS Mugridge seemed to be in rabid fear of the water and he exhibited a nimbleness and speed we did not dream he possessed
BTS The boat was close-hauled on a fresh breeze and the compass indicated that we were just making the course which would bring us to Japan
BTS He was not conscious of them
BTS And he himself had gone into the mills when he was ten
BTS Charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could which was not in the least well
BTS We leaned toward each other and before I knew it my arms were about her
BTS Matthewson waxed jubilant
BTS and then I discovered to my amazement that there was no need for Maud to slack away
BTS Pray do not interrupt me he wrote
BTS but it breathed its last by the time we managed to get to leeward of the last lee boat
BTS The noise from downstairs was as that of a score of battling fiends
BTS It did not take long to carry out this programme--only several weeks
BTS Also he has legs to stand on
BTS The chief obstacle to your Grange propaganda is the trusts
BTS But the Cockney was unabashed though mad stark mad
BTS Next the Appeal to Reason a big socialist publishing house arranged with father to bring out the book
BTS John Thornton stood over Buck struggling to control himself too convulsed with rage to speak
BTS Arthur was for twenty years Grand Chief of the Brotherhood
BTS What gets me Henry is what a chap like this that's a lord or something in his own country and that's never had to bother about grub nor blankets
BTS as it was I was compelled to apply all my weight and strength to every inch of the heaving
BTS Seven days from the time they pulled into Dawson they dropped down the steep bank by the Barracks to the Yukon Trail and pulled for Dyea and Salt Water
BTS He did not like to be approached on his blind side
BTS There were cries from the crowd of Go to him Cherokee
BTS I shall not describe the whole evening though it is a joy to me to recall every moment every detail of those first hours of my coming to know Ernest Everhard
BTS His carriage was one of mingled triumph and caution
BTS a very sick man Hump he said as he left my sustaining grip and sank into a chair
BTS I sawed and chopped and chiselled the weathered wood till it had the appearance of having been gnawed by some gigantic mouse
BTS I rowed into the adjoining cove and up to the edge of the beach
BTS Throw every year hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of shoes and wheat and clothing and all the commodities of commerce into the sea
BTS Gale followed gale with snow and sleet and rain
BTS And he nodded his young head sagely
BTS She took my advice and was turning to put it into execution when her eyes lighted on Oofty-Oofty immediately before her his body instinct with alertness and grace as he held the turn of the rope
BTS He was laughing at me
BTS That is what we are in business for
BTS I felt that I should lose my mind and I ran up the companion stairs to open the doors and escape on deck
BTS And so a decision was laughingly reached
BTS and though it was a mild night on the sea there was a continual chorus of the creaking timbers and bulkheads and of abysmal noises beneath the flooring
BTS bomb and knife and bullet were looked upon as so many fangs of the roaring abysmal beast they must dominate if humanity were to persist
BTS What had happened to him we could not imagine
BTS White Fang's tongue went out he knew not why and he licked the puppy's face
BTS We've smashed the water supply Hartman cried excitedly to me
BTS The swiftness of it was bewildering
BTS Love genuine passionate love was his for the first time
BTS and Anarchist
BTS And if at the end of the afternoon White Fang hasn't harmed a chicken for every ten minutes of the time he has spent in the yard you will have to say to him gravely and with deliberation just as if you were sitting on the bench and solemnly passing judgment White Fang you are smarter than I thought
BTS He saw a weasel leaping swiftly away from him
BTS The capsized sled ground over him and the dogs dashed on up the street adding to the gayety of Skaguay as they scattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare
BTS I said to Wolf Larsen
BTS We are in the dark
BTS P
BTS His hair bristled involuntarily
BTS There was a difference between White Fang and them
BTS so White Fang prepared to meet him in a friendly spirit
BTS The rotten bark gave way under his feet and with a despairing yelp he pitched down the rounded crescent smashed through the leafage and stalks of a small bush and in the heart of the bush on the ground fetched up in the midst of seven ptarmigan chicks
BTS I who could have bought them out bag and baggage and the schooner and its equipment a score of times over
BTS Wait and see Ernest said and I waited
BTS But what is it
BTS The thorns sprung up and choked me
BTS It was at Circle City ere the year was out that Pete's apprehensions were realized
BTS Kill or be killed eat or be eaten was the law
BTS Judge Scott pooh-poohed and laughed but not with reason for it was in his last days on the bench that Jim Hall had stood before him and received sentence
BTS A period wherein science was raped by the metaphysicians wherein physics became a search for the Philosopher's Stone wherein chemistry became alchemy and astronomy became astrology
BTS Perhaps I suggested
BTS And on this night as always the cloth bulged with his muscles while the coat between the shoulders what of the heavy shoulder-development was a maze of wrinkles
BTS It was during this period that he might have harkened to the memories of the lair and the stream and run back to the Wild
BTS Maud was leaning against the wall one hand out for support
BTS If all that I fear be so your private income your principal itself can be taken from you just as easily as your salary
BTS Cabin-boy at twelve ship's boy at fourteen ordinary seamen at sixteen able seaman at seventeen and cock of the fo'c'sle infinite ambition and infinite loneliness receiving neither help nor sympathy I did it all for myself navigation mathematics science literature and what not
BTS His dear tired eyes
BTS He swung the club smartly stopping the rush midway and smashing White Fang down upon the ground
BTS It simply means that in the attack on my brain the higher psychical centres are untouched
BTS One can't kick over the ropes if he's going to succeed in journalism
BTS Pacing back and forth the length of the hatchways and savagely chewing the end of a cigar was the man whose casual glance had rescued me from the sea
BTS I have found it so I added with an involuntary sigh
BTS And he certainly looked it with those bulging muscles and that bull-throat
BTS Come on now and I'll get you out of this
BTS and with your atavistic ideas they will have nothing to do because they are what I said they are henchmen retainers of the Plutocracy
BTS You may be unafraid Mr
BTS He did not go down again
BTS The signs are favourable for an extensive practice this voyage
BTS and patched shortened and distorted they were a ridiculously ill-fitting suit for so trim a craft as the Ghost
BTS I tiptoed across the cabin and to the top of the stairs
BTS Remember we agreed that the average man is selfish
BTS I am quite crushed Ernest murmured meekly
BTS That is why the scientist gets to places
BTS And so because he needed a god and because he preferred Weedon Scott to Beauty Smith White Fang remained
BTS There was no movement of the body whatever
BTS It should have been in its proper place in the rack
BTS Your eyes are becoming set
BTS But that is not the teaching of Christ
BTS He shot a glance in my direction to see if I was taking it in and went on
BTS But no village greeted his eyes
BTS It paused head up close by a clump of spruce trees and with sight and scent studied the outfit of the watching men
BTS Mercedes the men called her
BTS There was a silence I might almost call awkward till I broke it saying See those black clouds to windward
BTS I wisht they'd spring up a bunch of moose or something an' go away an' leave us alone Bill said
BTS Of course the crew gave me the go-by
BTS He was too discreet and cautious a man to incur Wolf Larsen's anger at a time when that anger could be expressed in terms stronger than words
BTS His whole concern was with the immediate objective present
BTS What else was I to do
BTS The phenomena of life Hump he girded at me
BTS Public questions were gravely debated and passed upon according to the old forms while in reality all that was done was to give the stamp of constitutional procedure to the mandates of the Oligarchy
BTS yet you do not object to making large profits yourself
BTS He sprang through the sleeping camp and in swift silence dashed through the woods
BTS Aw go lay down you make me tired Leach interfered
BTS One was into the Socialist Party
BTS Then the flood seemed suddenly to subside and I was breathing the good air again
BTS Manuel had one besetting sin
BTS In reality the wages had been raised much higher and the privileges were correspondingly greater
BTS She slept continuously a tiny skeleton flung round with skin in which the flame flickered lower and lower and at last went out
BTS Your chest is heaving your tongue protruding your skin turning dark your eyes swimming
BTS He agreed with Peter Donnelly that Jackson should have got damages and he went farther and called the action heartless and cold-blooded that had turned the worker adrift after he had been made helpless by the accident
BTS Such a word was the adjective UTOPIAN
BTS Then the clothes-bags were taken into the carriage the strange gods and the love-master followed and White Fang pursued now running vigilantly behind now bristling up to the running horses and warning them that he was there to see that no harm befell the god they dragged so swiftly across the earth
BTS It is too long a story to enter into now
BTS They changed the features with such microscopic care that no traces were left of their handiwork
BTS His smiling good nature vanished like a ghost
BTS I knew this was true of myself but hers was such a lily strength that I feared she would break down
BTS I started
BTS How Maud could stand it was beyond me
BTS The roll of the martyrs increased mightily
BTS Ernest's sledge-hammer attack disconcerted him
BTS he demanded
BTS and when he called me his sweet metaphysician I called him my immortal materialist
BTS But to return
BTS No one had remarked my absence
BTS I had taken a dislike to him at first and as he helped to dress me this dislike increased
BTS There was an endurance as of perpetual youth about him which rose up and forbade the picture
BTS I ought to be ashamed of myself she said
BTS Stand by to receive your dog was Scott's peremptory order to Cherokee's owner
BTS Young Wickson put his hands up first then turned to confront Biedenbach who held a thirty-thirty automatic rifle on him
BTS It was at this moment that Leach and Johnson looked up into the faces of their shipmates who lined the rail amidships
BTS It was a female and the law of his kind thrust a barrier between
BTS The bulging back of Cherokee's neck was the only portion of his body that White Fang's teeth could reach
BTS and I hope a better woman
BTS For the first time in many days I breathed freely
BTS As the roar of the bombs died away he began peering out
BTS He looked outside and half a dozen snow-birds fluttered across his field of vision
BTS The worst appeared inevitable
BTS I could catch glimpses of my face white and ghastly distorted with pain in the cabin mirror
BTS As I searched the vacant stretch of water before me I comprehended thoroughly the need for haste if we were to recover any of our men
BTS Two things I had acquired by my accident an injured knee-cap that went undressed and from which I suffered for weary months and the name of Hump which Wolf Larsen had called me from the poop
BTS the cry came down the open companion-way
BTS There were revolver shots
BTS He ain't down here
BTS An' with a gyme leg at that
BTS A week of this passed by
BTS and I saw almost above me and emerging from the fog the bow of a vessel and three triangular sails each shrewdly lapping the other and filled with wind
BTS When they saw him they rushed for him
BTS It made me angry and I glanced at Ernest
BTS When he returned to me the sweat was heavy on his forehead
BTS she objected
BTS That was to be expected
BTS Slowly slowly the bristling ball straightened out and lengthened
BTS Your promise
BTS the dog-driver cried to Perrault
BTS I had strayed forward where the sailors were painting and I came to myself to find my advancing foot on the verge of overturning a paint-pot
BTS The shears rose in the air
BTS I take it back
BTS Collie had been taken in charge by one of the woman-gods who held arms around her neck and petted and caressed her
BTS He was still limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him
BTS Besides Maud begged me to heave to and I knew if the wind and sea increased at the same rate during the night that it would soon be impossible to heave to
BTS Never mind Tommy I said placing a soothing hand on his shoulder
BTS This was living though he did not know it
BTS It strikes me as unnatural and unhealthful that men should be totally separated from women and herd through the world by themselves
BTS I blew up the embers we had not yet arranged a winter kitchen and quite feverishly cooked the breakfast
BTS yea also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil and madness is in their heart while they live and after that they go to the dead
BTS His masterfulness delighted me and terrified me for my fancies wantonly roved until I found myself considering him as a lover as a husband
BTS We of the Revolution caught vague rumors of the state of affairs but had nothing definite enough for an understanding
BTS When there is no pain I have perfect peace and quiet
BTS The wholesale jail delivery did not occur until well along into 1915
BTS This in itself was compensation for it is always easier to lean upon another than to stand alone
BTS The Rockefellers went into mines--iron and coal and copper and lead
BTS You can't tell who is in those darned buildings
BTS I said don't break them teeth the faro-dealer repeated more ominously than before
BTS It seems as simple as A B C
BTS Then it was cold
BTS Thus it was he learned the law and ere he left the domain of the chickens he had learned to ignore their existence
BTS One can only dimly feel these things
BTS And how far have we to go
BTS Where are you goin'
BTS White Fang paused
BTS I am not a workingman cap in hand asking you to increase my wages or to protect me from the machine at which I work
BTS Who controls the government to-day
BTS Mr
BTS There is one green hand in the crew Harrison by name a clumsy-looking country boy mastered I imagine by the spirit of adventure and making his first voyage
BTS What is true of the United States is true of every other capitalist country with developed resources
BTS The tin dishes were packed away unwashed
BTS for I was knocked down by their surging bodies and badly bruised
BTS Because I am not a pure exalted soul was the answer
BTS He dreamed
BTS He had found the lines which held them and cast them adrift
BTS You are certainly as safe here as you have been
BTS That they'd come aboard and cut our throats
BTS I've hearn sailors talk of sharks followin' a ship Bill remarked as he crawled back into the blankets after one such replenishing of the fire
BTS But Francois chuckling at the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice brought his lash down upon Buck with all his might
BTS Compared with White Fang they were frail and flabby and clutched life without any strength in their grip
BTS Our comrades sought him everywhere
BTS I remain silent and suffer ignominy as you will remain silent and suffer ignominy
BTS There were no seals behind us and ahead of us the line of fourteen boats like a huge broom swept the herd before it
BTS I heard the Bishop stumbling up the stairs and I opened the door
BTS Of course there was nothing definite
BTS The sun had not shone all day and it had been bitter cold
BTS For I had been elevating her too highly in my concepts of her removing her too far from the plane of the human and too far from me
BTS and between all the parts there was a perfect equilibrium or adjustment
BTS I made to step by him and he stood aside
BTS In four months possibly three if the season closes early Wolf Larsen said
BTS A dog taken off its guard its shoulder slashed open or its ear ripped in ribbons before it knew what was happening was a dog half whipped
BTS then would they be capable of softness and tenderness and sympathy
BTS I have said that he was afraid of nothing
BTS their capacity to communicate motion to unmoving things
BTS That vessel will soon be passing us I said after a moment's pause
BTS Nothin' he said slowly with a careless calmness that was assumed only goin' to keep that promise I made
BTS As I rounded the galley a new satisfaction was mine at thought of all the splendid cooking utensils inside
BTS They were tended by armies of servants and their social activities were bewildering
BTS I expected him to give orders for the Ghost to heave to but she kept on her course and he made no sign
BTS In the same way he accepted that his father could disappear into walls
BTS The toil of the traces seemed the supreme expression of their being and all that they lived for and the only thing in which they took delight
BTS Henry left the cooking to come and see
BTS And having surrendered the land the farmers next went to work for the farm trust becoming managers superintendents foremen and common laborers
BTS Behind every obstacle you encounter every blow that smites you every defeat that you receive is the hand of the trusts
BTS He lifted into the air described a short curve and struck the deck alongside the corpse on his head and shoulders where he lay and writhed about in agony
BTS On the sled in the box lay a third man whose toil was over a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor struggle again
BTS Force nothing but force obtained on this brute-ship
BTS And you are Maud Brewster I said solemnly gazing across at her
BTS I sprang out extending my hand to Maud
BTS Next in his regard after the children was Judge Scott
BTS I could not lift him directly into a bunk but with Maud's help I lifted first his shoulders and head then his body balanced him across the edge and rolled him into a lower bunk
BTS Our own refuges were packed with comrades who had prices on their heads
BTS But he did not run his best in this chase
BTS So it would seem Three Eagles Grey Beaver answered laying his hand on the cub
BTS But first let me tell of my marriage
BTS And what do I look like pray
BTS We took our place at once as agents-provocateurs in the scheme of the Iron Heel
BTS Somewhat rougher I warrant than what you have been used to but still-man-play
BTS It just happened
BTS You have made a shambles of civilization
BTS Sometimes the capitalists refused to let the laborers work
BTS The Charleston Baptist Association issued the following in an address in 1835 A
BTS It is so quiet and peaceful and I sit here and ponder and am restless
BTS I have it deposited in many different banks under different names
BTS One hundred dollars has been added to the value of the leather
BTS His father and mother lived wholly upon meat
BTS A majority of the men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor whereat the odds went up to three to one against Buck
BTS And while you maunder about restoring competition the trusts go on destroying you
BTS Ad 'is fingers around it but I pulled it through cuttin' to the bone
BTS and the Indians in strange villages swore likewise when they considered the tale of his killings amongst their dogs
BTS Each night after Sierra Vista had gone to bed she rose and let in White Fang to sleep in the big hall
BTS that muscles were softly crawling and shaping about the hips along the back and across the shoulders
BTS I am often thankful that I have no children and I dearly love children
BTS That both of you are hair-splitting I said
BTS A vast silence reigned over the land
BTS Hammerfield cried
BTS The cabin light was burning low
BTS She was a pretty sight leaping and flying toward us and evidently bound to pass at close range
BTS CHAPTER XXIX Fool
BTS Thus and unavoidably at the very beginning out of this segregation arose caste
BTS but it always recovered itself and in the main behaved satisfactorily
BTS We did sight one in the afternoon when the north-west breeze had sprung up freshly once more
BTS Even in the night in his dreams he was haunted by this fear
BTS better for that he said
BTS He nodded his head with a savage pleasantness
BTS The cub's shoulder was stiff and sore and for some time he limped from the terrible slash he had received
BTS The place had the empty and musty feel and smell usual to a dwelling no longer inhabited
BTS To live  I heard no more
BTS Fear urged him to go back but growth drove him on
BTS Get outa my galley-doors you bloomin' swabs
BTS The soul
BTS I struck him with my fist on the face as he raised his head but it was a puny blow
BTS In short when all things were considered he had to achieve an orientation far vaster than the one he had achieved at the time he came voluntarily in from the Wild and accepted Grey Beaver as his lord
BTS he cried when his eyes lit upon Buck
BTS Watch them wobble and go to pieces and their members become slaves driven to toil by empty stomachs and the law of the land
BTS His iron-like body ignored fatigue
BTS The winds baffled and we drifted aimlessly the greater part of the night
BTS She began young it is true
BTS Another advantage he possessed was that of correctly judging time and distance
BTS And what is more you know it
BTS Then the end of the thong was given over to him by Grey Beaver
BTS It was the first night I had spent under cover in several months and I lay luxuriously for some minutes under my blankets for once not wet with fog or spray analysing first the effect produced upon me by the cessation of the wind and next the joy which was mine from resting on the mattress made by Maud's hands
BTS Everhard said the other night the function you churchmen perform is to maintain the established order of society and society is established on that foundation
BTS In a hazy way I saw and heard men rushing and shouting as they strove to lower the boats
BTS Silence will mean agreement
BTS As the soldiers had carpeted the street with dead slaves so in turn did they themselves become carpet
BTS Thornton shook him back and forth
BTS They drank and drank and ever the bottles slipped forward and they drank more
BTS Do as I say and ere long you will find I am right
BTS Besides they were snarling all the time and his benumbed and drowsy senses no longer took note of changing pitch and intensity
BTS How was he to know that this thing that sniffed was a thing at which to bristle
BTS It is a case of life and death for us of the middle class
BTS He spoke at length and his conclusion was greeted with a wild roar of cheers
BTS Wolf Larsen was really the cause of it
BTS I'm sure I've heard it before somewhere in books she murmured gleefully
BTS yet he did not know the speech of the gods nor was there any way for him to learn save by experience
BTS He could not endure a prolonged contact with another body
BTS He plucked nervously at his sleeve as we talked
BTS I remembered Charley Furuseth and knew this man's sadness as the penalty which the materialist ever pays for his materialism
BTS Shouting making threatening gestures with my club and even prodding the lazy ones I quickly cut out a score of the young bachelors from their companions
BTS Out in the back-pasture a quail could flutter up under his nose unharmed
BTS CHAPTER IV THE WALL OF THE WORLD By the time his mother began leaving the cave on hunting expeditions the cub had learned well the law that forbade his approaching the entrance
BTS He smiled as though it were all settled
BTS The truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
BTS Men offered odds of two to one that Buck could not budge the sled
BTS I had forgotten the existence of Maud Brewster and I remembered her with a start as she stepped lightly beside me
BTS When Weedon and Maud had first approached him he growled warningly and looked malignant
BTS He testified to this at the trial but no one believed him
BTS It was not a column but a mob an awful river that filled the street the people of the abyss mad with drink and wrong up at last and roaring for the blood of their masters
BTS I asked her the hours she worked and she said it depended on the season
BTS the lightness of their natures had ebbed out of them
BTS And you've got to look out too
BTS and in the darkness Henry went about preparing breakfast while Bill rolled the blankets and made the sled ready for lashing
BTS Van Weyden will you kindly put about on the port tack
BTS From far away drifted a faint sharp yelp followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps
BTS And furthermore the son went on for every chicken he kills I'll pay you one dollar gold coin of the realm
BTS Before she went away the she-wolf had found this lair but the signs told her that the lynx was inside and she had not dared to venture in
BTS Do you believe in promises
BTS He turned and trotted reluctantly away
BTS They believed absolutely that their conduct was right
BTS Grey Beaver was in the debt of Three Eagles
BTS There was no trust no confidence anywhere
BTS What vessel is this and where is she bound
BTS The club dropped from her hand as though it had suddenly stung her and at the same moment my heart surged with a great joy
BTS Just about all in he announced
BTS It was a clarion-call that thrilled me
BTS He felt it as did the other dogs and knew that a change was at hand
BTS The oligarchs themselves were compelled to listen to the decrees of the Groups and often when they disobeyed were punished by death--and likewise with the subordinates of the oligarchs with the officers of the army and the leaders of the labor castes
BTS They're scattered an' rangin' along wide he said keeping up with us an' lookin' for game at the same time
BTS I worked feverishly
BTS This idea as I say was merely carried to its logical conclusion on a large scale by the combination of the oligarchs and the favored unions
BTS Not at all
BTS He combined and made war upon his carnivorous enemies
BTS Only they are so expensive
BTS No one heeded them
BTS But it is not that
BTS Bit by bit an inch at a time with here a wolf bellying forward and there a wolf bellying forward the circle would narrow until the brutes were almost within springing distance
BTS As far back as 1906 A
BTS he demanded back
BTS He curved his bushy tail around to cover them and at the same time he saw a vision
BTS His cowardly rages made them dread a shot in the back or poison in their coffee
BTS But Mugridge leaping suddenly caught the jib-boom-lift
BTS In the end she died peaceably of old age in a secret refuge of the revolutionists in the Ozark mountains
BTS He had no further serious trouble with the dogs
BTS But my eyes must have closed the instant my head touched the pillow and in utter exhaustion I slept throughout the night the while the Ghost lonely and undirected fought her way through the storm
BTS He sprang to the side
BTS He started to get up then looked back to his mate again and settled down and dozed
BTS I would fall asleep in the act of carrying food to my mouth and waken in torment to find the act yet uncompleted
BTS Twilight drew down and night came on and White Fang lay by his mother's side
BTS She beamed upon him through her terror-filled eyes and the pathos of it cut me to the heart
BTS But it was not altogether an unhappy bondage
BTS It's not over the hole she add
BTS The man in the red sweater had proved that
BTS And you don't know who or what she is eh
BTS and I caught a glimpse of a man standing at the wheel and of another man who seemed to be doing little else than smoke a cigar
BTS I stole into his state-room and possessed myself of his revolvers
BTS He grew maudlin familiar could hardly see the cards or sit upright
BTS A sudden and deep sympathy welled up in me
BTS Later a small tent was put up
BTS The set of his mouth his chin his jaw was likewise firm or harsh with all the fierceness and indomitableness of the male the nose also
BTS It was this instance that provoked from Eugene V
BTS But when the frames of poles were made into tepees by being covered with cloth and skins White Fang was astounded
BTS I was looking through the glasses and I saw the oar-blade shatter as he shot
BTS This was maddening to them
BTS Wild-eyed itinerant preachers swarmed over the land
BTS At that time one Felice Van Verdighan accompanied by two maids and a lap-dog with another maid for the lap-dog entered a drawing-room on a Pullman and a few minutes later was speeding west
BTS God pity those three regiments
BTS His written word was as his spoken word clear and convincing
BTS Two men were kneeling beside me working over me
BTS Her conscience did not trouble her for at that very time occurred the Nashville Massacre when the Mercenaries Donnelly in command literally murdered eight hundred weavers of that city
BTS There was no power of recuperation left no reserve strength to call upon
BTS Morning had evidently not come so I closed my eyes and went to sleep again
BTS Then his nose touched the flame and at the same instant his little tongue went out to it
BTS He'd kill them on sight
BTS The dogs had lain down in the snow and he walked past them to join his partner in the sled
BTS How does it come that you are alone
BTS Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles
BTS He dodged
BTS She gave me a quick look
BTS It fascinated him and he grew suddenly fond of this subtle flesh of his that worked so beautifully and smoothly and delicately
BTS Her modicum of strength had been exhausted and she was unable even to move from her position
BTS The very thing I was coming to he said
BTS Quite deliberately he determined to stay behind
BTS what was dear to the master was to be cherished by White Fang and guarded carefully
BTS The steerage told the same tale as the forecastle
BTS Less difficult it was to guess whom he hated than whom he did not hate
BTS They moved
BTS No it is not the hunger that makes the heart ache she explained
BTS The tent they had discarded at Dyea in order to travel light
BTS What its nature may be I refuse to imagine
BTS Wot I say
BTS They were fire-makers
BTS And by this I do not wish to be misunderstood
BTS Chicago was true to her traditions and though a generation of revolutionists was wiped out it took along with it pretty close to a generation of its enemies
BTS an' no good end will he ever come to
BTS And here and there this selfish policy worked successfully
BTS And besides you can knock a hole in the wall at any time
BTS Clew up the topsails first
BTS Directly his back was turned they were at it again
BTS This howling now bothered him
BTS CHAPTER III THE HUNGER CRY The day began auspiciously
BTS I was overborne by the crowd
BTS For that matter the world had ceased to exist
BTS Van Weyden
BTS We could see the front of their column filling the street from gutter to gutter as the last war-automobile fled past
BTS Father will be rejoiced to see you I said
BTS There remained the disguise of a member of the Oligarchy
BTS But father insisted on pursuing his favorite phantom and a protean phantom it was judging from the jobs he worked at
BTS He was a coward afraid to strike me because I had not quailed sufficiently in advance
BTS He was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow
BTS Now you know me he said
BTS His hand was heavy
BTS And so I
BTS And as they continued to fall upon him the spark of life within flickered and went down
BTS Hobbling about on it from morning till night was not helping it any
BTS An' wot 're you snifflin' about
BTS The dog-musher indicated White Fang with a backward thrust of his thumb
BTS This endured for some time
BTS Their open mutiny however was without doubt precipitated by the agents-provocateurs
BTS In similar way many sons of the Russian nobility played their parts in the earlier and protracted revolution in that country
BTS but roused he must have been for Smoke had a bruised and discoloured eye and looked particularly vicious when he came into the cabin for supper
BTS his voice rang out in warning to his comrades
BTS The days were growing longer
BTS A log fell apart with a loud spluttering noise
BTS In the main and ignoring the loss of liberty they were better off than they had been
BTS It was impossible to say no after that
BTS Had society then beaten him into submission
BTS But Collie did not give over as was her wont after a decent interval of chastisement
BTS Calvin said
BTS Take consolation in the fact that no member of your class has ever yet answered that charge
BTS It was the call the many-noted call sounding more luringly and compellingly than ever before
BTS The end is in sight
BTS The lips moved
BTS Joe came next yelping with pain
BTS I asked
BTS As he came up the port side we slipped past on the starboard
BTS Never had he heard her snarl so terribly
BTS A German Jew of the nineteenth century
BTS Of what use or sense is an immortality of piggishness
BTS He might have let the small flint that he saw in the teeth go through
BTS He had an encyclopaedic command of the field of knowledge and by a word or a phrase by delicate rapier thrusts he punctured them
BTS By it he trimmed his conduct and adjusted his actions
BTS The announcement was received with black silence though the other four hunters glanced significantly at the two who had been the cause of their banishment
BTS Never in that period did any of them crawl toward the dark corners of the back-wall
BTS Weedon Scott looked at him suspiciously
BTS But he was very sick
BTS Give 'm hell
BTS Between pain and pressure I fainted
BTS Ernest returned some books he had borrowed and went away first
BTS And now while we are on the trusts Ernest went on let us settle a few things
BTS All the great men ever did was to know it when it came to them
BTS How did it happen
BTS Then between them the she-wolf and One Eye devoured the game which the mysterious sapling had caught for them
BTS The situation was desperate
BTS He was justifying his existence than which life can do no greater
BTS If we could take to the boat and make round the point before any one awoke
BTS Buck to whom fair play was a forgotten code likewise sprang upon Spitz
BTS There is no other way out
BTS This was the man-animal's justice
BTS Next came official orders
BTS He killed to eat not from wantonness
BTS Scott snapped out
BTS He indicated the third person by a downward thrust of the thumb to the box on which they sat
BTS Three others tried it in sharp succession
BTS We can measure the unknown only by the known I replied in my finest academic manner
BTS I shall have to run at once to the wheel and at the same time you must be hoisting the jib
BTS A constitution of iron and the vitality of the Wild were White Fang's inheritance and he clung to life the whole of him and every part of him in spirit and in flesh with the tenacity that of old belonged to all creatures
BTS The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip
BTS Also I rent two rooms in workingmen's houses in different quarters of the city
BTS The war should be called off or the general strike would continue
BTS More wolves were appearing every moment and joining in the chase
BTS I was wet and chilled to the marrow till I felt more dead than alive
BTS I had to dig it out for myself
BTS Let us profit by their efficiency and cheapness
BTS You belong in the enemy's camp
BTS Once father took advantage of a lull and asked him to say something
BTS is the test
BTS Nothin' sir
BTS Her meaning was forgotten
BTS Ah the decisiveness the very sound of the words was good in my ears
BTS He thrust her off with his shoulder and his retreat cut off and still intent on regaining the sled he altered his course in an attempt to circle around to it
BTS Hal had no fight left in him
BTS Things no longer went right
BTS I felt myself a ghost what of my invisibility
BTS He came down a shelving bank to the stream
BTS Never had he been so fond of this body of his as now when his tenure of it was so precarious
BTS Extra chairs had been brought into the great drawing-room and in all there must have been two hundred Philomaths that sat down to hear Ernest
BTS My present opinion is that hell is a pocket edition of Chicago
BTS It went over suddenly burying its gunwale level with the sea and shipping a bucketful or so of water
BTS My heart seemed ready to burst with suppressed tears
BTS I did not know the Bishop murmured faintly
BTS Give him hell for me
BTS Though a long way from his full growth White Fang next to Lip-lip was the largest yearling in the village
BTS He too gave me the impression that he was not a free agent as we talked I began to see that he was mentally superior to the average of his kind
BTS Louis looked at me shrewdly
BTS I put one hand on the edge of the house to steady myself
BTS They never did it again
BTS Eyelashes and cheeks and lips were so coated with the crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible
BTS And when there was no meat to give Mit-sah would keep the team at a distance and make believe to give meat to Lip-lip
BTS The two doors slammed at the same moment and Weedon Scott waited for Matt to come around to the front
BTS I dropped fifty thousand dollars in that venture
BTS They will not dare reply to you because you hold their bread and butter their lives in your hands
BTS And England at the sacrifice of her great colonies had succeeded only in retaining India
BTS And yet it was only a quarter of a mile from Wickson's hunting-lodge and a short mile from the village of Glen Ellen
BTS And when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away
BTS I had lived a placid uneventful sedentary existence all my days the life of a scholar and a recluse on an assured and comfortable income
BTS For that matter I cannot think of my husband without thinking of it
BTS That night I sat at table with the captain and the hunters while Thomas Mugridge waited on us and washed the dishes afterward a whim a Caliban-mood of Wolf Larsen's and one I foresaw would bring me trouble
BTS Nobody will deny it
BTS It struck against the wall and his body seemed to express a muscular and physical relief at the contact as though he had found his bearings his location in space as well as something against which to lean
BTS In teaching her I learned quite a deal myself though I was applying the knowledge already acquired by sailing the Ghost and by watching the boat-steerers sail the small boats
BTS Then I ran to the side
BTS And he saw further
BTS The annals of this short-lived era of despair make bloody reading
BTS I ran to the windlass
BTS They're sure goin' to get us Henry
BTS The earth struck him a harsh blow on the nose that made him yelp
BTS I've learned that much at any rate
BTS The twelve o'clock dinner was over one day and I had just finished putting the cabin in order when Wolf Larsen and Thomas Mugridge descended the companion stairs
BTS Hardly had the carriage entered the grounds when he was set upon by a sheep-dog bright-eyed sharp-muzzled righteously indignant and angry
BTS An offshoot of the Seventh Day Adventists sprang into sudden prominence proclaiming the end of the world
BTS There was too much of the fighting beast in him
BTS I see you're working my philosophy back on me for all it is worth
BTS For sure
BTS Opportunity favoured when White Fang remained quiet
BTS He gave no protection
BTS His face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs and he fought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly
BTS but the destruction of the socialist press and publishing houses constituted too great a handicap while the mouth-to-mouth propaganda had not yet been perfected
BTS For six months I was kept in prison though charged with no crime
BTS That's all right all right Parsons spoke up
BTS A common device of competition
BTS There was a greater movement
BTS After a particularly fierce blow he crawled to his feet too dazed to rush
BTS Mugridge went down on the fore-hatch under three men
BTS After that I was not surprised when he tended bar for a week in the saloon across the street
BTS Van Weyden Wolf Larsen commanded
BTS You cannot deny it
BTS His muscles had wasted away to knotty strings and the flesh pads had disappeared so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness
BTS D'ye hear that
BTS Or had they been sleeping
BTS he cried
BTS The first balloon missed the fortresses completely and disappeared into the country
BTS Don't ask me
BTS It was invested with the woe of unnumbered generations this plaint by which Buck was so strangely stirred
BTS He cringed involuntarily under the expected blow
BTS I asked the cook
BTS He sprang back bristling and snarling fearful of the unseen and unknown
BTS What's wrong
BTS He had had no idea that I had left New York and coming through the room where I lay asleep could not at first believe that it was I
BTS their muscles ached their bones ached their very hearts ached
BTS These two defeats had been very disastrous to organized labor
BTS The serious critic with the sense of humour and the power of expression must inevitably command the world's ear
BTS I slept again and the next I knew I was on top of the building
BTS We live only a stone's throw away
BTS White Fang was suspicious
BTS It seemed he would fly to pieces so terrible was the control he was exerting holding together by an unwonted indecision the counter-forces that struggled within him for mastery
BTS but the fear of the future was strong upon him and he was glad each time when he was not selected
BTS You lay the stress upon the desire apart from the soul Miss Brewster lays the stress on the soul apart from the desire and in point of fact soul and desire are the same thing
BTS The earth is as full of brutality as the sea is full of motion
BTS Mercedes was riding the loaded sled
BTS Each day this remnant of the pack dwindled
BTS O 'e was a sight I can tell yer
BTS He knew it as a secret prompting as an urge of instinct of the same instinct that made him howl at the moon and stars of nights and that made him fear death and the unknown
BTS Robert Hunter in 1906 in a book entitled Poverty pointed out that at that time there were ten millions in the United States living in poverty
BTS But they did not stop at one or two
BTS To this day I do not know what became of that half-mile of humanity--whether it was blotted out by some frightful bolt of war whether it was scattered and destroyed piecemeal or whether it escaped
BTS I was in my brougham driving through the streets
BTS He had covered the distance and gone in more like a cat than a dog
BTS The lords of society stole legally or else legalized their stealing while the poorer classes stole illegally
BTS This time he was aware that it was the club but his madness knew no caution
BTS In high glee father described the incident to us that evening
BTS His heredity was a life-stuff that may be likened to clay
BTS It was a pleasant evening indeed and we voted that as a social function on Endeavour Island it had not yet been eclipsed
BTS And when I do you must do your first work on the windlass
BTS Want to see it work
BTS It was with gratitude that I hailed these signs of a new interest in life though I little dreamed what the outcome would be
BTS eh
BTS Thank Gawd she's not comin' all of a bunch Mr
BTS I have come to doubt that saying
BTS You're promoted
BTS As well may you lift yourselves by your own bootstraps as to explain consciousness by consciousness
BTS The time went by
BTS No longer was this fact borne in upon him in some subtle mysterious way
BTS quoth Thomas Mugridge and they clinked their glasses to the glorious game of Nap lighted cigars and fell to shuffling and dealing the cards
BTS The hiding-place was mine
BTS The counter-plot was an able achievement and ably carried out
BTS It's the she-wolf Bill answered
BTS I asked
BTS These gods also made overtures to White Fang but he warned them off with a snarl and the master did likewise with word of mouth
BTS In the day you rise in your strength toothless and clawless you will be as harmless as any army of clams
BTS I shouted at her harshly
BTS To save his son he betrayed his comrades
BTS A hasty drawing back always resulted accompanied by angry yelps and frightened snarls when a well-aimed brand struck and scorched a too daring animal
BTS Wolf Larsen was nearly to the top though I could not see him
BTS His face was convulsed and white his eyes were flashing his clenched fists raised overhead
BTS I'd like to perhaps but I can't
BTS Part way up Sonoma Mountain John Carlson let the girls go on leading his horse while he went back on foot
BTS They were swayed by the same ethic that dominated their husbands--the ethic of their class
BTS I talked a great deal and enthusiastically as a hero-worshipper might talk and it was obvious that he was my hero
BTS days of sleet and wind and snow-squalls when nothing could keep us warm
BTS If Beauty Smith had in him a devil White Fang had another
BTS Tell me I said when one surrenders his personal feelings to his professional feelings may not the action be defined as a sort of spiritual mayhem
BTS A man's got his rights
BTS It was a torment this hand that touched him and violated his instinct
BTS Why I'm getting everything ready for re-stepping the masts I replied easily as though it were the simplest project imaginable
BTS And so as he abandoned his rush at her and braced himself to avoid the contact she sprang upon him
BTS To quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do
BTS What terrified me was the Bishop's helplessness
BTS And look out for squalls is Louis's prophecy for they hate one another like the wolf whelps they are
BTS Of course here and there farmers and even whole communities of farmers escaped expropriation by virtue of exceptional conditions
BTS What is the matter
BTS It always aroused people
BTS Straight toward the square hole of the step the square butt descended
BTS He sensed the evil in him and feared the extended hand and the attempts at soft-spoken speech
BTS The Black Hundreds were a development out of the secret agents of the capitalists and their use arose in the labor struggles of the nineteenth century
BTS Here life was clean noble and alive
BTS He sadly overrates himself
BTS Kiche
BTS Oofty-Oofty took a turn on a bitt the rope tautened and the Ghost lunging onward jerked the cook to the surface
BTS I met Colonel Ingram at a church reception
BTS The other glared at him in sudden wrath
BTS White Fang's gods were always hunting animals
BTS Let us not destroy those wonderful machines that produce efficiently and cheaply
BTS Forgotten already were the vanquished rivals and the love-tale red-written on the snow
BTS Will you take the lady below and see to her comfort
BTS The effect on White Fang was to give him a greater faith in himself and a greater pride
BTS Not since the death of my mother had I known him to laugh so heartily
BTS at Ernest
BTS he snorted
BTS Dave had bitten through both of Sol-leks's traces and was standing directly in front of the sled in his proper place
BTS Nope
BTS I stood regarding him wonderingly
BTS White Fang was torn by conflicting feelings impulses
BTS He had learned the law
BTS Stability equilibrium he said relaxing on the instant and sinking his body back into repose
BTS His temper had been savage by birth but it became more savage under this unending persecution
BTS Go on Henry pleaded elevating the pot
BTS Thus he learned hurt
BTS And all the time the killing of the wounded went on
BTS All right Ernest said
BTS It is true we are even now building still more wonderful wonder cities but the wonder cities of the oligarchs endure and I write these lines in Ardis one of the most wonderful of them all
BTS You have seen that you were beaten soundly at your old tactics of strike and boycott Ernest urged
BTS It was an old song old as the breed itself one of the first songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad
BTS As in the past he had bristled and snarled at sight of Lip-lip so now and automatically he bristled and snarled
BTS It seemed centuries possibly it was no more than ten minutes that the beating continued
BTS The thing was done thoroughly and with despatch
BTS Also he must watch out for the live things
BTS He was innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced
BTS I had seen the frightful treatment of the cabin-boy and knew that I should very probably receive the same if not worse
BTS And so we shall
BTS I had slept twenty-one hours
BTS It was a seal-hunting boat she replied and you know perfectly well that if the men had escaped they would have been back to make their fortunes from the rookery
BTS There isn't a street car running
BTS The moment Mit-sah gave his order for the start that moment the whole team with eager savage cries sprang forward at White Fang
BTS Oh Henry
BTS I know not why but I was aware of a twinge or pang like the cut of a knife when he mentioned her
BTS What if the trail of the gods led out on that side
BTS It won't hurt him
BTS May I never shoot a seal again if that ain't a woman
BTS You started a branch store here in Berkeley about six months ago
BTS This was a female of his kind and it was a law of his kind that the males must not fight the females
BTS You've sold out the cause of labor of all labor
BTS They blocked their own efforts while Wolf Larsen with but a single purpose achieved his
BTS In consequence the men were sullen and vindictive
BTS He had gripped me by the biceps with his single hand and when that grip tightened I wilted and shrieked aloud
BTS But then I suppose this was a common experience of all of us who had rallied under the red banner of the brotherhood of man
BTS But the world now seemed changed
BTS But I tremble for you when I think of all you are to prove by Jackson's arm
BTS Hammerfield and Dr
BTS Here in the abandoned lair he settled down and rested for a day
BTS yet he never found time to do all the work he wanted to do
BTS Nevertheless I forbid you I distinctly forbid your tampering with my ship
BTS Then all the quills drooped quite down and the body relaxed and moved no more
BTS It is because of this life that is in you that you dream of your immortality
BTS Take off your shoes that's right and carry them in your hand
BTS He glanced from face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it going again
BTS But he had a certain clear way of stating the abstruse in simple language was a born expositor and teacher and was not above the soap-box as a means of interpreting economics to the workingmen
BTS His soul hasn't anything to do with it
BTS Upon which impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex-prerogative she made their lives unendurable
BTS He swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life
BTS But always there is one meal a day and often two
BTS This is insult
BTS The effect on one's sensibilities was weird depressing
BTS Well we don't I concluded defiantly beginning again my knocking and hammering
BTS Everybody sat fascinated--paralyzed I may say
BTS He never knew defeat
BTS Blankets for a hotel quoth one of the men who laughed and helped
BTS So the dogs came to understand that when the team stopped by order White Fang was to be let alone
BTS And as it was in Germany so it was in the United States
BTS All her suspicions were justified
BTS And Hump I can tell you that you know more about me than any living man except my own brother
BTS After a long time the god got up and went into the cabin
BTS It was a moment of anxiety for the Ghost was rushing directly upon the beach a stone's throw distant
BTS They are not biologists nor sociologists
BTS The strength of your wealth at this moment is only an empty shell
BTS And she was young--only forty
BTS Then he began to laugh derisively and scornfully
BTS The trouble arose first with the Grangers in the various states they had captured at the last election
BTS Oh please please Humphrey don't
BTS I took six fish out of the bag
BTS Before I could grasp the situation or act he had walked right into the trap
BTS After a time he left Kiche's side and crawled cautiously toward the wall of the nearest tepee
BTS The metaphysician explains the universe by himself the scientist explains himself by the universe
BTS I shall take the revolvers
BTS I'll wait for a dead sure shot was the reply
BTS The vision of her as I had last seen her in the lantern light of the schooner's hold her brown eyes warm and moist with joy flashed before me and I knew that I could not go back
BTS Maud asked
BTS but there has been a diminishing and I am now able to eat you
BTS But I have run away from my narrative
BTS And now that they're gone 'tis revenge for my blasted manhood I'm after
BTS It was not pleasant work
BTS Meat is scarce answered his comrade
BTS You are beginning to divine your own end
BTS As Buck grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games in which Thornton himself could not forbear to join
BTS They are in most of the great railways radiating from Chicago
BTS And then without warning a mob arose one night and under a waving American flag singing patriotic songs set fire to the great plant of the Appeal and totally destroyed it
BTS Ha
BTS The guys had been slashed right and left
BTS My mother and sisters were always about me and I was always trying to escape them
BTS A more surprised party of rescuers could not be imagined had they ventured down into our hiding-place
BTS About what
BTS Every fighting fibre of him was quivering and his face was the face of a fighting animal withal he was cool and collected
BTS Pound him on the head
BTS No member of the favored unions was safe
BTS There was no defending it
BTS He did not care to serve God
BTS The summer camp was being dismantled and the tribe bag and baggage was preparing to go off to the fall hunting
BTS Hammerfield interrupted
BTS Indeed she trod the earth lightly and in her constitution there was little of the robust clay
BTS Let us control them
BTS The little lawyer glared at me a moment and then the belligerence faded out of his face
BTS To those that survived it was not tragedy but realisation and achievement
BTS A heavy price of gold was upon his head
BTS father cried
BTS Nobody had been affected
BTS Men told this to one another and looked each time to see it happen
BTS There's nothing can be done on deck
BTS All my old fear of him returned and by my new fear was increased an hundred-fold
BTS There
BTS He no longer lived in a hostile environment
BTS and it was Collie that saved the hound's life
BTS Yes sir
BTS came a final cry and the two men waved their arms in farewell
BTS I was disappointed shocked
BTS But blow followed blow with bewildering rapidity
BTS We must give ourselves and not our money alone
BTS Not that he went out of his way looking for trouble
BTS So in the night when the men in the fort were asleep White Fang applied his teeth to the stick that held him
BTS But there are his arms his hands his terrible terrible hands
BTS But there was his faithfulness and he went back to be betrayed yet a third time
BTS The other kind included all live things that moved
BTS All of which has set me wondering
BTS and he won his revenge by spreading glowing reports among the hunters as to what an excellent lydy's-myde I was proving myself to be
BTS Every hour was filled with shock and surprise
BTS Possibly he had seen men towed before
BTS but the spar righted despite my efforts and dropped back toward the water
BTS 'Tis sealin' is the sailor's paradise on other ships than this
BTS Next day time and again the baying hounds came down the canyon plunged off to the left on the trail Carlson had made for them and were lost to ear in the farther canyons high up the mountain
BTS He gave a short disagreeable laugh
BTS Here arose dissent
BTS He had never barked in his life and he could not now learn to bark a welcome when his god approached
BTS I had thought to see that day
BTS Heaven and hell may be the prime factors of zeal in the religion of a fanatic
BTS That will shake them to the roots of their primitive natures
BTS The proletariat has grown up outside the Church and without the Church
BTS This morning however on entering his state-room to make the bed and put things in order I found him well and hard at work
BTS A shaft of sunlight smote the over-curl and I caught a glimpse of translucent rushing green backed by a milky smother of foam
BTS He alone rated himself beyond diamonds and rubies
BTS There were no other weapons though I thoroughly ransacked the three remaining state-rooms
BTS Men fight and struggle ferociously for one another's lives
BTS What do you propose in order to get rid of the surplus
BTS He favoured me with a quizzical smile
BTS You who have destroyed the government of the people and who shamelessly flaunt your scarlet shame in public places call me anarchist
BTS Ernest insisted
BTS But I do not feel calm
BTS And in addition to everything there was his studying
BTS Though he followed her he was still dubious and he could not forbear an occasional halt in order more carefully to study the warning
BTS and a great rotund New York member began shouting Anarchist
BTS Concerning his own rages I am convinced that they are not real that they are sometimes experiments but that in the main they are the habits of a pose or attitude he has seen fit to take toward his fellow-men
BTS It must have been painful I said sympathetically
BTS Not quite he laughed
BTS He was astounded at the suddenness of it
BTS Henry leaped out of the blankets and to the dogs
BTS He had learned to get along without her
BTS Holding the paper in my left hand I smashed down upon the cap with a rock held in my right
BTS Bill turned and looked then quietly stopped the dogs
BTS Don't I know
BTS The gong thundered more frequently and more furiously
BTS '  I'll fix yer bloody well right' I sez an' kept right after 'im
BTS His face was shining his eyes flashing with excitement as he translated into articulate language the speech of the horns and sirens
BTS The surface cars and the elevated were not running
BTS and you have no more hope against us than have the drones clustered about the honey-vats when the worker-bees spring upon them to end their rotund existence
BTS Insanity
BTS He began to notice near objects an open portion of the stream that flashed in the sun the blasted pine-tree that stood at the base of the slope and the slope itself that ran right up to him and ceased two feet beneath the lip of the cave on which he crouched
BTS I know that it won Wolf Larsen's approval while the sailors beamed with satisfaction during the brief time my regime lasted
BTS And we shall give you an answer in terms of lead
BTS There is the classic instance of the ferocious and wanton judicial murder of the innocent and so-called Haymarket Anarchists in Chicago in the penultimate decade of the nineteenth century A
BTS He distributes to every man according to His own good pleasure conformably to general laws
BTS From half-past five in the morning till ten o'clock at night I am everybody's slave with not one moment to myself except such as I can steal near the end of the second dog-watch
BTS Every little while however one dog or another would flame up in revolt and be promptly subdued
BTS Here and there whole districts were still in possession of the comrades but such districts were surrounded and guarded by heavy bodies of troops
BTS Between White Fang and them existed a neutrality and no more
BTS The thumb of circumstance had done its work only too well
BTS I wrote a quiet restrained dispassionate account of Jackson's case
BTS And you
BTS Here horses were ready and another comrade and without delay we were away through the starlight
BTS At first I thought of knocking then I remembered my ostensible errand and resolved to carry it out
BTS I was an interested spectator of events and sometimes swept on by the rush was myself a curious participant
BTS The Church was dumb then and before I go on I want you either flatly to agree with me or flatly to disagree with me
BTS He must master or be mastered
BTS On either side of his body stood his two rivals
BTS All was ready
BTS And there it was again the division of labour the special knowledge of the pilot and captain which permitted the stout gentleman to read my special knowledge on Poe while they carried him safely from Sausalito to San Francisco
BTS You know that
BTS What was of value to the master he valued
BTS As he made the demand he spat out a mouthful of blood and teeth and shoved his pugnacious face close to Oofty-Oofty
BTS She had never forgiven him the chicken-killing episode and persistently held to the belief that his intentions were bad
BTS the progress down-stream amazingly rapid
BTS But it was all forgotten the next moment as he sprang after the she-wolf who was coyly leading him a chase through the woods
BTS For him to attack her would require nothing less than a violation of his instinct
BTS Torn by his horror of the asylum and his fidelity to truth and the right he clung steadfastly to truth and the right
BTS His favourite way of ignoring her was to lie down with his head on his fore-paws and pretend sleep
BTS The Bishop was struggling hard
BTS One day three dogs were turned in upon him in succession
BTS He did not dare venture away from the gods for now the fangs of all dogs were against him and he tasted to the dregs the persecution that had been White Fang's
BTS The poor farmers Ernest once laughed savagely
BTS He had waited too often and futilely in the past for porcupines to unroll to waste any more time
BTS A low throaty rumble arose lingered on the air a moment and ceased
BTS Of course I understand
BTS I gasped caught my breath painfully and opened my eyes
BTS but still more surprising was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks
BTS The cub was in a frenzy of terror yet he lay without movement or sound frozen petrified into immobility to all appearances dead
BTS Young man he trumpeted that statement is on a par with all you have uttered to-night
BTS He ordered much meat to be given and White Fang gorged and sleepy by the fire knew that the law had received its verification
BTS And he had no recourse
BTS He knew not how nor why yet he got his feel of the oncoming event from the gods themselves
BTS No I answered but we are approaching it at a rate of six miles an hour
BTS I am not fit dear brethren to tell you anything about morality
BTS They should work hand in hand and to their mutual benefit
BTS How about your own policy
BTS Though in total darkness I followed his progress by its sound
BTS CHAPTER XXVI Wolf Larsen took the distribution of the whisky off my hands and the bottles began to make their appearance while I worked over the fresh batch of wounded men in the forecastle
BTS The boat was leaping and pounding as it fell over the crests I could hear the seas rushing past and spray was continually being thrown aboard
BTS Several men picked up the hatch-cover with its ghastly freight carried it to the lee side and rested it on the boats the feet pointing overboard
BTS So White Fang knew nothing of the heaven a man's hand might contain for him
BTS And they were not namby-pamby oaths or mere expressions of indecency
BTS The Macedonia's third weather boat was being attacked by two of ours the fourth by our remaining three
BTS There is no congeniality between him and the rest of the men aboard ship
BTS But the joy of shooting to hit is a most compelling thing when once you've learned how to shoot
BTS The master's domain was wide and complex yet it had its metes and bounds
BTS Ernest told me that the fraction of an instant before it exploded he both heard and saw it strike at his feet
BTS Half a mile of it had disappeared--where or how I never learned
BTS At the end of such a romp when blow and cuff and snap and snarl were fast and furious they would break off suddenly and stand several feet apart glaring at each other
BTS And you've been shooting off your mouth about them
BTS By the middle of the second day he had been running continuously for thirty hours and the iron of his flesh was giving out
BTS It was he that first learned the trick of rolling a fellow-cub over with a cunning paw-stroke
BTS As Mr
BTS Then rested refreshed and strong he turned his face toward camp and John Thornton
BTS but I was left alone in my little hut glowing warmly through and through with a pleasant satisfaction
BTS The lordship of man was a need of his nature
BTS and I confess ere the day was done that I hated him with more lively feelings than I had ever hated any one in my life before
BTS I remember his conclusion his black eyes flashing as he said Gentlemen the South Sea Islander may do it the Malay may do it but take my word it's beyond the white man
BTS An adjective descriptive of ruined and dilapidated houses in which great numbers of the working people found shelter in those days
BTS But you who make a mock of human life don't you place any value upon it whatever
BTS On point after point Ernest challenged the ministers
BTS D'ye hear
BTS You may go for'ard and turn in I said taking it from him
BTS Also in his gambling he had one besetting weakness faith in a system
BTS I know nothing that I may say can influence you he said
BTS and the chief outlet of expression that remained to him was in the allegiance he tendered the gods he had accepted as masters
BTS In which case the hunter cannot steer and shoot at the same time
BTS Whet whet whet Humphrey Van Weyden sharpening his knife in a ship's galley and trying its edge with his thumb
BTS I have related this in order to show the mental calibre of the men with whom I was thrown in contact
BTS If it's yer luck to ever make 'Frisco once more will you hunt up Matt McCarthy
BTS And just seven days afterward was approved by the President of the United States
BTS The boat slewed around
BTS Also there was awe in their faces
BTS And now you'd better get for'ard to your hospital duties
BTS Colonel Ingram blushed actually blushed and again he looked anxiously about him for a way of escape
BTS I also brought blankets and we made him comfortable
BTS no eighty-three
BTS I was continuing
BTS This suggested an idea to me
BTS I just wanted you to know it was me he said in the darkness
BTS Perhaps after all I was playing a cowardly part
BTS They did not want their men to go forth to die
BTS It was rusty and dull but I turned the grindstone while Louis gave it an edge
BTS I shall make certain statements and if you disagree with them speak up
BTS I mean no offence believe me
BTS And so I say-- But at this point H
BTS As I see it I do wrong always when I consider the interests of others
BTS and when the red light and the white had disappeared we returned to the cabin to finish the interrupted supper
BTS The mate cursed him in the darkness and the next moment some missile struck the galley a sharp rap
BTS I am so tired she said with a quick intake of the breath and a sigh drooping her head wearily
BTS It would appear that they are a half-brute half-human species a race apart wherein there is no such thing as sex
BTS and ere the day was done so well had he mastered his work his mates about ceased nagging him
BTS It   Here she paused and looked about the table at the circle of unsympathetic faces staring hard at the plates
BTS There are only so many countries in the world
BTS The last few inches to the wall of the tepee were crawled with painful slowness and precaution
BTS and as the days went by they continued to come up the river stop and then go on up the river out of sight
BTS It was only by the severest muscular exertion and neck-arching that he succeeded in getting the wood between his teeth and barely between his teeth at that
BTS They did not succeed and they were very stupid
BTS Then later when the split came I joined the local of the S
BTS Their children attended schools especially built for them and in these schools manual training and applied science were specialized upon
BTS He met me with the conventional gayety and gallantry
BTS Few things could have been more to their liking than to give him a tow over the side for to the forecastle he had sent messes and concoctions of the vilest order
BTS And I remembered his end upon the cross and my heart contracted with a pang as I thought of Ernest
BTS To labour at living and be unpaid is worse than to be dead
BTS She bounded in amongst them her anxious and militant motherhood making her anything but a pretty sight
BTS The god sat down several feet away
BTS And then they go ahead and do it unwitting that one of the weaknesses of the human mind is that the wish is parent to the thought
BTS You must be wrong
BTS he began with a suaveness that was cold and of the temper of steel
BTS And still I was proud of her because of it
BTS The mid-air part of one great deed I saw however and that was the balloon attacks made by our comrades on the fortresses
BTS His face was white his lips were trembling
BTS Stern justice was meted out by these organized avengers but most remarkable was their passionless and judicial procedure
BTS I place the transparent scale on this star-map revolving the scale on the North Pole
BTS Not to be considered he laughed
BTS So to him the entrance of the cave was a wall a wall of light
BTS I followed at his heels
BTS Believe me the situation is serious
BTS Other men call me Wolf
BTS They sat dumbly acquiescent with the exception of Dr
BTS Not only was he released from prison in reward for his deed but he was granted an income for life
BTS And all the while the she-wolf sat on her haunches and smiled
BTS Everywhere it goes begging
BTS It was a lynx kitten partly grown like the cub but not so large
BTS What the hell's the matter with you
BTS This through many years of service and wear had acquired a long lean blade
BTS It will make it easier for you to act your part
BTS To the day of his death he kept up his studies and he studied prodigiously
BTS in 1902 127713
BTS that is the message of the Church today
BTS the sun ate from above
BTS The days and nights are all a wonder and a wild delight and though I have little time from my dreary work I steal odd moments to gaze and gaze at the unending glory of what I never dreamed the world possessed
BTS CHAPTER II THE BONDAGE The days were thronged with experience for White Fang
BTS Ernest's blood was up
BTS You tell me that I dream
BTS But you should penalise father too interpose Beth
BTS Beaten decisively on its own chosen field it had abandoned that field and come over to the political field of the socialists
BTS never
BTS It looks only reproachful
BTS And then suddenly without warning uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal John Thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club
BTS Just as the sky paled with the first warning of dawn I heard the signal from above and gave the answer
BTS Farther on are the cells where the prisoners were confined and the death chamber where the executions took place
BTS There had been warning but White Fang was unversed in such things and did not understand the packing of a grip
BTS What d'ye think
BTS I live in one of the loveliest localities of San Francisco
BTS Everything went smoothly and I laughed at Ernest when he looked upon the very smoothness as something ominous
BTS I can tell them how I found you
BTS He was behaving as a wolf-father should and manifesting no unholy desire to devour the young lives she had brought into the world
BTS There was nothing else for him to do
BTS Sometimes he pursued the call into the forest looking for it as though it were a tangible thing barking softly or defiantly as the mood might dictate
BTS He looked very sick
BTS She was a delicate ethereal creature swaying and willowy light and graceful of movement
BTS She made another leap and another
BTS And yet the mast was not swung entirely inboard
BTS I was not very strong
BTS But most potent in his education was the cuff of the master's hand the censure of the master's voice
BTS And yet this is not altogether true
BTS He had come into the world with a twisted body and a brute intelligence
BTS No more long-winded calculations
BTS Suddenly I became aware of him leaning back from the table and listening curiously to our alien speech of a world he did not know
BTS Men preyed upon one another like ravening wolves
BTS To such an extent was he tormented that he hated blindly and without the faintest spark of reason
BTS The smoke of the Macedonia had dwindled to a dim blot on the north-eastern horizon
BTS There lies Japan I remarked straight before us
BTS In his conception of things there was no future life
BTS He had been man-handled
BTS One cannot violate the promptings of one's nature without having that nature recoil upon itself
BTS Half as many is too much
BTS The sled was without runners
BTS There was a cry in my being like bugles calling me to her
BTS He is a pure exalted soul but he is so unpractical
BTS Ernest was delicate in such matters
BTS ' He looked at me curiously
BTS Only I guess we know what's best for us a little bit better than you do
BTS But he had lost his nerve
BTS He next became a private detective for a street railway corporation and by successive steps developed into a professional strikebreaker
BTS They will jeer at me when I prophesy and prophesy with the utmost confidence that at the next presidential election the socialists will poll over a million votes
BTS Here the seals hauled out and the old bulls guarded their harems while the young bulls hauled out by themselves
BTS The general gloom had gathered me into its folds
BTS Mebbe he is going to die
BTS I did not get an answer
BTS You Kerfoot go for'ard and see what's become of Cooky
BTS As I say don't take my word for it
BTS He had striven to help the unfortunate Harrison at the risk of incurring Wolf Larsen's anger
BTS This instinct is stronger than any ethic they possess
BTS and when we braced ourselves automatically for these various expected movements their non-occurrence quite overcame our equilibrium
BTS It may not fan sufficiently to make the desire overmastering but in so far as it fans at all that far is it temptation
BTS I got out the oars and made her row though she was so weak I thought she would faint at every stroke
BTS The she-wolf ran herself thin in the quest for meat
BTS that the arms were slightly lifted their muscles contracting the fingers crooking till the hands were like talons
BTS He did not mingle with it but remained aloof always himself and was even feared by it
BTS But Bishop Morehouse ignored him and went on Their outlook is too narrow
BTS Den we get one long res'
BTS Miserable and disconsolate he wandered about among the many tents only to find that one place was as cold as another
BTS Without pausing for breath though my heart was beating like a trip-hammer from my exertions I sprang to the topsails and before the wind had become too strong we had them fairly set and were coiling down
BTS Here Grey Beaver stopped
BTS Mr
BTS The man who had spoken to him was clearly a Cockney with the clean lines and weakly pretty almost effeminate face of the man who has absorbed the sound of Bow Bells with his mother's milk
BTS Kowalt and Mr
BTS It had happened many times yet each time it was as fresh a surprise as ever to him
BTS I agree with you Mr
BTS Will you get a tourniquet Mr
BTS One broken hind-leg he went on
BTS But when you squeal you don't state the situation flatly as I have stated it
BTS He was assassinated in 1932 by Sarah Jenkins whose husband thirty years before had been killed by Farley's strike-breakers
BTS And at once as in an instant's leap the sun was blotted out there was no sky even our mastheads were lost to view and our horizon was such as tear-blinded eyes may see
BTS He stirred them to discussion and analyzed their thoughts of life and society
BTS If you come I'll shake them for you
BTS And in order to do so let us apportion society into its class divisions
BTS The capitalist class has mismanaged
BTS and I could see nothing but her face and a mass of light brown hair escaping from under the seaman's cap on her head
BTS Several times I collided against hard objects once striking my right knee a terrible blow
BTS Certainly Ernest answered
BTS By returning to a primitive method of production so confused and disorderly and irrational so wasteful and costly that it will be impossible to produce a surplus
BTS I fixed him he repeated while a sombre light burnt in his eyes and his huge toil-distorted hands opened and closed eloquently
BTS Also they grew irritated when I told them of the deplorable condition of Jackson's family and when I wondered that they had made no voluntary provision for the man
BTS The Red Virgin is reported to have been one of the most adept in the art to which must be ascribed her long and successful career
BTS He took Buck by the scruff of the neck and though the dog growled threateningly dragged him to one side and replaced Sol-leks
BTS The pang as I plunged into it was as quick and sharp as that of fire
BTS But you will observe that I didn't come back the way I went
BTS But this he was to learn early in his residence in Santa Clara Valley
BTS I felt an abrupt easing of the schooner a loss for the moment of all strain and pressure coupled with a swift acceleration of speed
BTS They had no economic nor political souls of their own
BTS He was firmly planted on his legs
BTS His clutch was broken
BTS A Mexican dish referred to occasionally in the literature of the times
BTS I wanted to cry aloud
BTS Owen destroyed competition here in Berkeley when your branch store drove the three small groceries out of business
BTS His tremendous dormant strength must have stirred swiftly and accurately or I must have slept a moment for before I knew it he had stepped two paces forward gripped my right hand in his and held it up for inspection
BTS The she-wolf stood over against her cub facing the men with bristling hair a snarl rumbling deep in her throat
BTS He was assailed terribly in the press in long and abusive editorials for his anarchy and hints were made of mental breakdown on his part
BTS Time passed
BTS But on the day we finished bending the schooner's sails he heard his last and the last movement of his lips died away but not before I had asked him Are you all there
BTS I helped myself also to blankets mittens oilskins caps and such things from the slop-chest
BTS But the most peculiar virtue of all lay in the fact that the dog that strove to attack one in front of him must pull the sled faster and that the faster the sled travelled the faster could the dog attacked run away
BTS Successful as he was with squirrels there was one difficulty that prevented him from living and growing fat on them
BTS But they can't hurt me father objected
BTS He obeyed but with a rush hurling himself upon the stranger who was dragging him away
BTS The months went by
BTS Then wherein am I wrong
BTS Calvin interrupted
BTS The Bishop had already arrived and we were having tea on the veranda
BTS The great Kansas Mutiny occurred at the very beginning of military operations against the Grangers
BTS The whole fabric of society is a-tremble with them
BTS I'll finish this rescue all right but I want time time lots of it--and something to eat
BTS Hands were things to keep away from
BTS The Danites taking their name from the avenging angels of the Mormon mythology sprang up in the mountains of the Great West and spread over the Pacific Coast from Panama to Alaska
BTS They finish in half that time
BTS From either side we could hear the rattle and roar of war while the automobile picked its way through smoking ruins and tottering walls
BTS Wot I say
BTS His development or retrogression was rapid
BTS That will be only twenty-four miles she urged if the wind remains high all night
BTS But to return to my indictment
BTS He discovered the mistake too late when Thornton was abreast of him and a bare half-dozen strokes away while he was being carried helplessly past
BTS What I needed was rest if it were ever to get well
BTS I was growing angry
BTS So we have preached power
BTS He was sprawling along between some bushes when he heard a sharp intimidating cry
BTS Comrade Biedenbach was absent-minded forgetful
BTS He picked the quarrel with the strange dog while the gang waited
BTS Germany Italy France Australia and New Zealand were busy forming cooperative commonwealths
BTS There was their mastery over all these sharp-fanged dogs
BTS May not the combination endure forever
BTS At this sweeping rebuke which the cook had only pointed the rest of the crew became uninterested and fell to work at one task or another
BTS Their creed was Bust the Trusts
BTS He looked at her quickly half-hopefully and then said all regretfully Too late
BTS Three days I worked on that windlass
BTS Teek who had not travelled so far that winter and who was now beaten more than the others because he was fresher
BTS That's what's ailin' you
BTS I had not the experience to steer at the gait we were going on a quartering course
BTS and here the episode ended for the time though further developments were yet to take place
BTS We needed the sail for the boat and the tarpaulin had begun to leak
BTS Matt made a couple of steps toward White Fang but the latter slid away from him
BTS So far Ernest was right
BTS He staggered limply about the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver
BTS Just wait till we get in the Grangers said--Calvin said it to us in our Pell Street quarters
BTS Of course you will do that
BTS His eyes were wet
BTS The beating that had gone before was as nothing compared with the beating he now received
BTS And not only did he outrun them but circling widely back on his track he gathered in one of his exhausted pursuers
BTS Strange to say the unfortunate Johnson came into my mind as we lifted and surged and heeled along and I was aware of a regret that he was not alive and present
BTS To destroy the trusts is the only way we can see to escape their domination
BTS This had been strong upon him when he pulled in to the bank and it had not departed from him
BTS And see that you serve no more slops was his parting injunction
BTS Yes yes I know and that man my brother more sentiment
BTS He flung it back so that it struck the sled and bounced along until it fetched up on Bill's snowshoes
BTS There was something ominous in his silence his immobility
BTS But he stood motionless and staring as before
BTS Again he refused to take it from the hand and again it was tossed to him
BTS The line is thick with them
BTS 'Tell me are you happy
BTS Occasional light airs were felt however and Wolf Larsen patrolled the poop constantly his eyes ever searching the sea to the north-eastward from which direction the great trade-wind must blow
BTS He did not snarl at her nor show his teeth when any leap of hers chanced to put her in advance of him
BTS All the ghosts of the past arose and were with him
BTS Stop and think a moment
BTS It is all a dream now as I look back on it
BTS I sat in the gallery that day
BTS In 1905 A
BTS Recover yourself
BTS And when shall we arrive at Yokohama
BTS He watched his moving muscles and was interested in the cunning mechanism of his fingers
BTS White Fang experienced dual feelings
BTS They drank whisky they drank it neat and I fetched more
BTS When he saw White Fang's eyes beginning to glaze he knew beyond doubt that the fight was lost
BTS The previous evening he had reasoned himself into the blues and I had been waiting momentarily for one of his characteristic outbursts
BTS As for you I have for you a deep respect as a scientist
BTS Flying-fish are beginning to be seen and during the night the watch above scrambles over the deck in pursuit of those that fall aboard
BTS But there was nothing
BTS We simply must be in luck or it's all up with us
BTS Wolf Larsen had separated from Latimer and was coming toward us
BTS Despite continual and almost inconceivable hazards Anna Roylston lived to the royal age of ninety-one
BTS In many places scattered over the country slave revolts and massacres had occurred
BTS The three men were bailing
BTS When their morality is questioned they grow only the more complacent and superior
BTS It reminded me of the problem of lifting oneself by one's boot-straps
BTS I cried involuntarily pointing to the north-east
BTS And of what could a roof be made
BTS Then at the same instant he saw and smelt
BTS Why should I be parsimonious with this life which is cheap and without value
BTS Tried to steal you eh
BTS After all she was only a woman crying her relief now that the danger was past in the arms of her protector or of the one who had been endangered
BTS I followed the Bishop into a small room ten by twelve in a rear tenement
BTS It left a great void in him somewhat akin to hunger but a void which ached and ached and which food could not fill At times when he paused to contemplate the carcasses of the Yeehats he forgot the pain of it
BTS Larsen I answered weakly
BTS He is going to deliver his message
BTS But each side wants to possess the machines
BTS Ducking turning doubling he slid about the deck eluding the other's efforts to capture him
BTS He's just come through hell an' this is the first time he's ben loose
BTS He stood high in the councils of the socialist party was one of the leaders and was the acknowledged leader in the philosophy of socialism
BTS I too had been groping and floundering the while I thought I rode clear-eyed through the mystery
BTS He merely sprang to the side and ran stiffly ahead for several awkward leaps in carriage and conduct resembling an abashed country swain
BTS In fact the business that brought me there the night of my visit was such a trial
BTS The other reached into the holster at his hip drew his revolver and tried to thrust its muzzle between the bull-dog's jaws
BTS Bill held up the empty cup
BTS One at a time
BTS and one clear day a thing we rarely encountered now I had the satisfaction of running and handling the Ghost and picking up the boats myself
BTS In that instant the lynx struck
BTS And then my arm was chewed off
BTS And as shipwright and able assistant she laughed back
BTS And now for the next step
BTS I don't feel right somehow
BTS Oh only on the other side he added as though divining the suspicious glance I flung at his left leg the knee of which had just then drawn up and elevated the blankets
BTS White Fang sliding by in quest of meat stopped and began to eat the chips
BTS I confess I wanted the coffee badly
BTS I couldn't afford to let the hunter have it and there is a chance the boat-puller doesn't know how to steer
BTS and it's not me should tell you your business but I wouldn't tote that tent along if I was you
BTS Yet I have here given Ernest's prophecy because it was his prophecy
BTS Smooth-shaven every line was distinct and it was cut as clear and sharp as a cameo
BTS It was this renewal of peace that brought about the alliance between Germany and the United States
BTS Being able to possess it I wrong myself and the life that is in me if I give it to you and forego the pleasure of possessing it
BTS We were sheltered under the very aegis of one of the minor oligarchs
BTS I had never heard anything like it in my life nor could I have conceived it possible
BTS He knew that he had responded to something from without that his sensibility had been touched by a changing something in his environment
BTS The point had been driven home
BTS It would have meant terrible times and great loss of life but no revolutionist hesitates at such things
BTS Feigning again
BTS Oh yes he acknowledged
BTS Weedon Scott laughed
BTS They bought nothing
BTS He noticed me and I became conscious that I was staring at him
BTS There was no sounding such a spirit no measuring no determining of metes and bounds nor neatly classifying in some pigeon-hole with others of similar type
BTS I asked incredulously
BTS It is to be regretted that she did not live to complete her narrative for then undoubtedly would have been cleared away the mystery that has shrouded for seven centuries the execution of Ernest Everhard
BTS He deluged me overwhelmed me with argument
BTS Buck described a complete circle in the air and half of another then crashed to the ground on his head and chest
BTS White Fang was disinclined to desert him
BTS And twice again we came down the path burdened with skins till I thought we had enough to roof the hut
BTS CHAPTER XXXI It will smell I said but it will keep in the heat and keep out the rain and snow
BTS But it was only for the moment
BTS As for its inventor beyond an increasing deafness and the movement of the lips growing fainter and fainter there had been little change in his condition for a week
BTS It is horrible
BTS A pretty mess that 'Frisco whisky got me into an' a prettier mess that woman's got you into aft there
BTS Besides White Fang was a valuable animal the strongest sled-dog he had ever owned and the best leader
BTS Like other men they passed out of Buck's life for good
BTS W'y 'as all this come on me
BTS It was the guerdon of my love for him
BTS They were society women
BTS Here in the factory was combination and before it competition faded away
BTS He assured me again and again that it was the last thing in the world he would dream of doing in a sober moment
BTS Without warning a shower of bombs fell from the top of the building
BTS the teeth gleamed cruelly white
BTS The crack of the rifle of the soldier sitting beside me made me open my eyes and I saw George Milford whom I had known in the Pell Street days sinking slowly down to the sidewalk
BTS Of course we cannot prove this
BTS It was his first battle
BTS I was amused a couple of evenings back by seeing Wolf Larsen reading the Bible a copy of which after the futile search for one at the beginning of the voyage had been found in the dead mate's sea-chest
BTS Pike who had been trembling abjectly took heart at this open mutiny and sprang upon his overthrown leader
BTS We walked to the break of the poop where she turned and faced me
BTS Thomas Mugridge demanded a moment later
BTS In his nostrils was the smell of the camp-smoke
BTS Once when he half raised it I saw the sweat standing in heavy drops on his forehead about the roots of his hair
BTS You mean
BTS He's a downright murderer I know was the dog-musher's comment
BTS Swallow a spoonful of sody an' you'll sweeten up wonderful an' be more pleasant company
BTS Then we'll learn together sir
BTS He was elated
BTS He may be dead
BTS Next I pried the primer or cap from the shell and laid it on the rock in the midst of the scattered powder
BTS His body turned a half-somersault in the air and he would have landed on his back had he not twisted catlike still in the air in the effort to bring his feet to the earth
BTS Where's the wolf
BTS She drew away obediently and then I thought What if she cannot find the steps
BTS And here I was with dreary and endless vistas before me of table-setting potato-peeling and dish-washing
BTS Jackson himself did not impress me when I hunted him out
BTS You have buzzed like gnats about a bear
BTS For several days there had been a great hubbub in the village
BTS He had great faith in Buck's strength and had often thought him capable of starting such a load
BTS For that matter the professional men and the artists are at this present moment villeins in everything but name while the politicians are henchmen
BTS It is you who have made me brave
BTS Mugridge menaced with the knife he was sharpening for me
BTS A red-faced man slamming the cabin door behind him and stumping out on the deck interrupted my reflections though I made a mental note of the topic for use in a projected essay which I had thought of calling The Necessity for Freedom A Plea for the Artist
BTS Or is it a misconception of mine that shipwrecked people are always shown every consideration
BTS But Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck
BTS The only values he recognized were mathematical and scientific facts
BTS As twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head watching his mates the cows he had known the calves he had fathered the bulls he had mastered as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading light
BTS There was no fan-formation of the team
BTS What of his bushwhacking and waylaying tactics the young dogs were afraid to run by themselves
BTS The other Indians laughed loudly and urged the man on to pick up the cub
BTS Then she sprang away up the trail squalling with every leap she made
BTS All my days had been passed in comparative ignorance of the animality of man
BTS Come back to earth
BTS Still the calm continued
BTS And it is by these A B C's I have so carefully elaborated that I shall confound you Ernest retorted
BTS He was not used to the simple and direct method of controversy
BTS Clear enough I answered glancing at the sunshine which streamed down the open companion-way
BTS What would happen to me when these men discovered my presence
BTS No it was impossible
BTS The crowd began to grow unruly and some of the men were protesting against the spoiling of the sport
BTS The dear and lovely woman
BTS I estimated its circumference at twenty-five miles its width as varying from two to five miles
BTS This was the pride that bore up Spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in the morning
BTS Precisely in the way that the door slid back he slid aside and I stepped out on deck
BTS They strained to catch some interruption of the silence and immobility of nature
BTS He had lost his voice or he was losing it
BTS Stand by that jib with Johnson and Oofty
BTS Go home
BTS In the days that followed as Dawson grew closer and closer Buck still continued to interfere between Spitz and the culprits
BTS Nothing daunted him
BTS As his mother Kiche had rendered her allegiance to them at the first cry of her name so he was beginning to render his allegiance
BTS He ceased speaking and his gaze wandered absently past her and became lost in the placid sea
BTS Here you
BTS But it was work hard work all of it
BTS But Ernest steadied himself for a moment and waved his arms for silence
BTS I heard of a man once who invaded the nesting grounds of wild geese Maud said
BTS 'I told him that we would walk upon the faces of the working class
BTS I questioned
BTS which is grey dark and light and greenish-grey and sometimes of the clear azure of the deep sea
BTS Oh I'm going to be married I answered lightly and then I'll be out of it all
BTS But she straightened it the next moment
BTS but he did not look at it
BTS If you will look at the economic history of the United States you will see that the sum total of capital has continually increased
BTS It was necessary for us to keep an eye on friend as well as foe and this group of madmen was not too unimportant to escape our surveillance
BTS You understand seal-hunters are so new and strange to me that I am quite ready to expect anything
BTS Thus we landed on Endeavour Island as we came to it land-sick from long custom of the sea
BTS It felt much better the swelling had materially decreased and the cap seemed descending into its proper place
BTS some one shouted and a guffaw of laughter went up
BTS Tim Keenan strode into the ring
BTS As before we drifted down upon it
BTS And so with White Fang
BTS Both men bent over the dogs
BTS Where there is room for one life she sows a thousand lives and it's life eats life till the strongest and most piggish life is left
BTS Next day both Germany and the United States declared war and within an hour the socialists called the general strike in both countries
BTS 'E's got no right to live an' as the Good Word puts it 'E shall shorely die' an' I s'y Amen an' damn soon at that
BTS Stand ready for a call
BTS Scott turned his back on him and returned to help the dog-musher who was working over White Fang
BTS After several experiences White Fang never stopped without orders
BTS Then I counted the dogs an' there was still six of 'em
BTS The amusing part of it is that the funds of the insurance companies were frequently plundered and wasted by the very officials who were intrusted with the management of them
BTS It was not so much what he said as how he said it
BTS The other end of the stick in turn was made fast to a stake in the ground by means of a leather thong
BTS it comes to the soldier war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter
BTS He sighed again and surrendered
BTS But that's no reason  Standish began in a torrent of speech
BTS Yet nothing had occurred and he was now in splendid trim
BTS A curious and amazing literature that served to make the working class utterly misapprehend the nature of the leisure class
BTS By the way Mr
BTS He had shielded me and received the first brunt of the attack
BTS The Oligarchy's public defence for the act was that it had done it for the sake of the American people whose interests it was looking out for
BTS Or else he probes them with the cruel hand of a vivisectionist groping about in their mental processes and examining their souls as though to see of what soul-stuff is made
BTS At first suspicious and hostile White Fang grew to like this petting
BTS I was growing to have faith in that windlass for it gave me power beyond all expectation
BTS He ordered the cabman to drive on and went away swearing horribly
BTS And third and last comes my class the proletariat which is composed of the wage-workers
BTS In the end they come to a standstill
BTS His eyes fluttered and went shut
BTS Whenever one made an attempt to break back toward the water I headed it off
BTS The New York Court of Special Sessions in 1905 A
BTS How long she had been there in that suffocating atmosphere I could not guess
BTS She relieved me at the bailing-hole from time to time and bravely she threw out the water and faced the storm
BTS Johnson and Leach were bullied and beaten as much as ever and they looked for their lives to end with the end of the hunting season
BTS But Maud said Tut tut in gentle reproval and then asked why I was a blithering idiot
BTS But that mental power was yet in the future
BTS After his condemnation he surrounded himself with a myriad protective devices
BTS In those days murder in the first degree was a capital offense
BTS It was for you and you should have seen the need of a window
BTS You doubt your immortality eh
BTS And then just as suddenly like the sun rising on a stormy sea they would begin to laugh
BTS He arose and related the history of the suppression of the book
BTS The business of love was at hand ever a sterner and crueller business than that of food-getting
BTS All feuds and grudges were forgotten and I was surprised at the alacrity with which the men who had so long endured his brutality sprang to execute his orders
BTS These swung back and forth with every roll of the vessel giving rise to a brushing sound as of trees against a roof or wall
BTS he finally exploded and went back to his task
BTS in September he was stricken with rheumatism of the heart and lived for three days
BTS And this was Buck's pride too
BTS One or the other must give over and that one was White Fang
BTS I don't like the look of it
BTS He paused again
BTS Dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice
BTS The abysmal brute would roar anyway and the police and Mercenaries would slay anyway
BTS Well I'll be gosh-swoggled
BTS They are a company of celibates grinding harshly against one another and growing daily more calloused from the grinding
BTS A member who failed to complete his number committed suicide
BTS The remaining forty received sentences varying from thirty to forty-five years
BTS Before he had hunted in play for the sheer joyousness of it
BTS But stay where you are and keep yer mouth shut
BTS From cabin to forecastle it seems to have broken out like a contagion
BTS You are a blessed bankrupt pair of fools
BTS A fresh breeze was blowing and for a time I was alone in the moist obscurity yet not alone for I was dimly conscious of the presence of the pilot and of what I took to be the captain in the glass house above my head
BTS Page one hundred and thirty-two I read aloud 'The class struggle therefore presents itself in the present stage of social development between the wage-paying and the wage-paid classes
BTS The reaction from my fear and the knowledge that the terrible deed I had come to do was no longer necessary made me boyish and eager
BTS The magnitude of the task may be understood when it is taken into
BTS Never mind father
BTS The storm had evidently broken during the night though a huge sea was still running and a stiff wind blowing
BTS The appropriation of the personal belongings of others by our own children of to-day is looked upon as a rudimentary survival of the theft-characteristic that in those early times was universal
BTS This was an error that was an assumption and the next was an assertion contrary to ascertained truth as printed in all the text-books
BTS He seemed rather to have the courage of his convictions the certainty of his manhood
BTS Why had I trusted myself within reach of those terrible arms
BTS I waited smiling inwardly at the woman of her which compelled a solicitude for Wolf Larsen of all creatures
BTS And behind this cry was Japan ever urging and aiding the yellow and brown races against the white
BTS It was the very essence of the unknown
BTS so you and all the rest of labor will participate in the equitable distribution of the products of the wonderful machines
BTS And well it learned the lesson
BTS They are so pretty she objected
BTS It was tense and hoarse with an overmastering rage
BTS But White Fang could not get at the soft underside of the throat
BTS When he grew tired he found his way back to the cave and slept
BTS It's all right about the dogs but we must draw the line somewhere
BTS White Fang snarled no warning but his hair bristled as he made his silent and deadly rush
BTS He forgot all about the unknown
BTS namely the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers
BTS Bellying forward to the edge of the clearing he found Hans lying on his face feathered with arrows like a porcupine
BTS But he did not come
BTS But it is dark in here she said the next moment her shoulders shrinking with a little involuntary shiver
BTS He saw himself caught in the web and he tried to escape from it
BTS I guess that's what it ought to be called
BTS Thick banks in the north and north-west
BTS But this did not satisfy Weedon Scott
BTS that manufacturers have deliberately provoked strikes in order to get rid of surplus stock
BTS but day broke cold and cheerless with the same clouded sky and beating wind and roaring seas
BTS And often such was the communion in which they lived the strength of Buck's gaze would draw John Thornton's head around and he would return the gaze without speech his heart shining out of his eyes as Buck's heart shone out
BTS It was bottom up and there was no sign of its crew
BTS That is what we socialists are trying to bring about--the abolition of the conflict of interest
BTS Prometheus
BTS Every little while flurries like this occurred each flurry culminating in the revolver shot that put an end to it
BTS He ran again through the silence hunting his living food through the months of famine
BTS But a portion of this knowledge was quickly to be his
BTS After breakfast I had another unenviable experience
BTS Somewhere out there in the snow screened from his sight by trees and thickets Henry knew that the wolf-pack One Ear and Bill were coming together
BTS Wickson who owned the whole eastern and northern slopes of Sonoma Mountain running from the Spreckels estate to the divide of Bennett Valley
BTS He never slept more than four and one-half hours a night
BTS And it was this alliance that the Oligarchy afterward so treacherously broke when the German socialists rose and drove the war-lord from his throne
BTS All was quiet on the streets--too quiet
BTS and the end of the battle found him again clinging to a hind-leg and furiously growling between his teeth
BTS you can all but speak
BTS but he missed the railing and his hand with his weight behind it landed squarely on the hot surface
BTS He could not stand being laughed at
BTS I forgot to inquire he went on suavely as to the nature of your occupation
BTS Her face brightened
BTS The liability of shipping another such sea was enormously increased by the water that weighed the boat down and robbed it of its buoyancy
BTS Those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp but a something which is best described as a roar and they saw Buck's body rise up in the air as he left the floor for Burton's throat
BTS Of his own choice he came in to sit by man's fire and to be ruled by him
BTS In vague ways it was borne in upon him that a change was impending
BTS You are piggish and acquisitive but the magic of your phrases leads you to believe that you are patriotic
BTS And still she did not move
BTS He offered to reinstate me in the university
BTS Half a dozen men were about the man who crouched in the centre of the dying fire
BTS Next came my repulsion when he so savagely attacked my class and me
BTS They came and went resided in the populous kennels or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots the Japanese pug or Ysabel the Mexican hairless strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground
BTS Then the she-wolf sat down pointed her nose at a star and began to howl
BTS He lived again all his days with Beauty Smith and the fights he had fought
BTS He's a corporation lawyer and corporation lawyers are not paid for being fools
BTS And he did it deliberately
BTS And some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them
BTS She placed the tips of her fingers on them
BTS She aroused smiled drowsily and was off to sleep again
BTS The warders said it was impossible but nevertheless the cell was empty and half in half out of it lay the body of a dead guard
BTS It carn't come right
BTS It would have exploded prematurely
BTS She was comparatively dry but she was numb with the cold
BTS After that he sat up and gazed about him as might the first man of the earth who landed upon Mars
BTS He was single-purposed and entertained but one thought or desire at a time
BTS As I emerged from the lazarette I heard sounds in Wolf Larsen's state-room
BTS They got out of his way when he came along
BTS Not a copy was obtainable from any bookseller
BTS and I was terribly impressed by the tragedy of a sane normal saintly man being crushed by the brutal will of society
BTS There was mild protest in his pale blue eyes and withal a timid frankness and manliness that quite won me to him
BTS You have no souls to be influenced
BTS But the porcupine squealing and grunting with disrupted anatomy trying feebly to roll up into its ball-protection flicked out its tail again and again the big cat squalled with hurt and astonishment
BTS And because we draw upon eternity she retorted
BTS but two of them women perpetrated the hostile act of clutching the master around the neck
BTS The canvas was heavy and hard and she sewed with the regular sailor's palm and three-cornered sail-needle
BTS Ernest demanded
BTS If Jackson and all his fellows were treated mercifully the dividends would not be so large
BTS Not a line of which will appear in to-morrow's papers
BTS With a restless movement he rolled his head around clearing his left ear from the pillow against which it had been pressed
BTS It was not the first time we had put our foot down upon war but it was the first time we had done so in the United States
BTS He awoke once and saw in front of him not a dozen feet away a big grey wolf one of the largest of the pack
BTS And the change was to me likewise adventure and the greatest of all for it was love-adventure
BTS For moral courage is a worthless asset on this little floating world
BTS Any signs of fog
BTS Had he been bulldozed into recanting
BTS Damn sight better dead and outa your reach than alive and in your clutches
BTS It was in his eyes that I saw the cause of her perturbation
BTS Ernest interrupted
BTS And when he had overthrown the strange dog the gang went in to finish it
BTS The tracks is there in the snow now
BTS And it was such dispiriting effort
BTS Three of the Reds lost their lives in vain efforts to get him
BTS the next day thirty-five more to the Little Salmon
BTS I'm going to Dawson
BTS But to their nostrils came the myriad smells of an Indian camp carrying a story that was largely incomprehensible to One Eye but every detail of which the she-wolf knew
BTS O'Connor laughed and shook his head
BTS If there had you'd have heard of it soon enough
BTS But there were other forces at work in the cub the greatest of which was growth
BTS A tangled mass of women with drawn white faces and open mouths is shrieking like a chorus of lost souls
BTS As it was he ran the young wolf down and killed and ate him
BTS There are ten thousand cities in the United States to-night lighted by the companies owned or controlled by Standard Oil and in as many cities all the electric transportation--urban suburban and interurban--is in the hands of Standard Oil
BTS Only remained to him to run away
BTS he hesitated painfully and in his eyes fear leaped large
BTS Another disconcerting thing was that it made no outcry such as he had been accustomed to with the other dogs he had fought
BTS She struck White Fang at right angles in the midst of his spring and again he was knocked off his feet and rolled over
BTS What do you think of that Mr
BTS Look at those three-cornered tears
BTS The dancing tremulous light was in her eyes
BTS I have never seen him otherwise
BTS ' 'Section Nine that the militia when called into the actual service of the United States shall be subject to the same rules and articles of war as the regular troops of the United States
BTS All this is inconceivable to us--as inconceivable as another custom of that time namely the habit the men of the lower classes had of breaking the furniture when they quarrelled with their wives
BTS You enjoy it
BTS Unseen and occultly the gods still gripped with their power and would not let her go
BTS It's darn good coffee Henry said enticingly
BTS When the steamboat arrived at Dawson White Fang went ashore
BTS and again his eyes roved over every sail and he gave commands to slack a sheet here a trifle to come in on one there a trifle till he was drawing out of the Ghost the last bit of speed she possessed
BTS In a moment the decks were in commotion Johansen bellowing orders and the men pulling or letting go ropes of various sorts all naturally confusing to a landsman such as myself
BTS One diversion of his when we were in the midst of the herd and the sea was too rough to lower the boats was to lower with two boat-pullers and a steerer and go out himself
BTS I knew well the noble nature of Bishop Morehouse and I could not conceive that his voice raised for righteousness would be no more than a little inadequate wail
BTS But the later name sticks
BTS though why such a magnificent animal as he should have headaches at all puzzles me
BTS Bill uttered an exclamation
BTS With the exception of the two mongrels they were bewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in which they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received
BTS Still I don't see I objected
BTS He ain't had no chance yet
BTS One thing about her which surprised me was her lack of timidity and fear
BTS This was the man that looked at White Fang delighted in his ferocious prowess and desired to possess him
BTS I was able always to hear the morning and evening trains arrive and depart and I used to set my watch by the whistle at the brickyards
BTS The other puppies came sprawling toward him to Collie's great disgust
BTS But the cove that intervened
BTS One Ear was uttering quick eager whines lunging at the length of his stick toward the darkness and desisting now and again in order to make frantic attacks on the stick with his teeth
BTS An' wasn't it a week later that the poor little ladies was put ashore on the other side of the island with nothin' before 'em but to walk home acrost the mountains on their weeny-teeny little straw sandals which wouldn't hang together a mile
BTS It is their votes that make Mr
BTS He stopped abruptly and then on his lips formed one of his strange quizzical smiles as he added It's from my brain I envy you take notice and not from my heart
BTS The door was burst open
BTS Tormented incited to hate he was kept a prisoner so that there was no way of satisfying that hate except at the times his master saw fit to put another dog against him
BTS What can I do for you
BTS to will but not to execute
BTS Here a squat and brawny god held sway with much noise hurling trunks and boxes about dragging them in through the door and tossing them into the piles or flinging them out of the door smashing and crashing to other gods who awaited them
BTS Henry looked at him commiseratingly and said I'll be almighty glad when this trip's over
BTS What were your last observations
BTS Poor Maud whom I could never prevent from working to the limit of her strength lay weakly back in the stern-sheets
BTS and one young hunter hurling a spear at Buck in mid air drove it through the chest of another hunter with such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood out beyond
BTS Intellectually they had bored him
BTS Mackenzie hounds Eskimo and Labrador dogs huskies and Malemutes all tried it on him and all failed
BTS Why not creep aboard the Ghost well I knew the way to Wolf Larsen's bunk and kill him in his sleep
BTS at the best he could know only things that were beyond knowing but the wonder and awe that he had of these man-animals in ways resembled what would be the wonder and awe of man at sight of some celestial creature on a mountain top hurling thunderbolts from either hand at an astonished world
BTS On the contrary it was even pleasant in a physical way
BTS Francois leashed them and brought them on deck
BTS Or dying was her afterthought when she had waited some time for me to speak
BTS Life in the Northland was simplicity itself when compared with the complicated affairs of Sierra Vista
BTS He experienced two great impulsions to yield and to fight
BTS You know dear heart how proud I am because you love me
BTS When father became convinced that the book had actually been suppressed he tried to get the fact into the newspapers
BTS But Grey Beaver laughed loudly and slapped his thighs and told the happening to all the rest of the camp till everybody was laughing uproariously
BTS Say yes sir
BTS He nodded his head
BTS You feel yourself and your branch stores a pawn in the game
BTS I do not follow you the Bishop said faintly
BTS The dying man beat a tattoo on the hatch with his heels straightened out his legs and stiffened in one great tense effort and rolled his head from side to side
BTS First disorder was precipitated by the secret agents and the Black Hundreds then the troops were called out
BTS And beyond that fire in the circling darkness Buck could see many gleaming coals two by two always two by two which he knew to be the eyes of great beasts of prey
BTS Now hell's a poppin' for somebody
BTS They might have fought but even wooing and its rivalry waited upon the more pressing hunger-need of the pack
BTS It joined in the general strike out of sheer desperation
BTS It owns four billions
BTS And she knew it
BTS The reason for this change was quickly learned by the hunters and became the cause of a deal of grumbling on their part
BTS Me sir answered Holyoak one of the deep-water sailors a slight tremor in his voice
BTS It no longer was as one dog leaping in the traces
BTS The squirrels were in hiding
BTS He would lie concealed for hours following every movement of a cautious tree-squirrel waiting with a patience as huge as the hunger he suffered from until the squirrel ventured out upon the ground
BTS He is mad this morning
BTS In the natural course of things there were exceptions to this
BTS It was a perfect hiding-place
BTS He never let go his rifle even passing down the tackles with one hand
BTS Only the regularly organized militia was out and it was out everywhere
BTS All halting utterance vanished
BTS But the moment before the rifle came to a level on him he leaped sidewise behind the corner of the cabin
BTS she cried
BTS He was put into a baggage-car by the master chained in a corner in the midst of heaped trunks and valises
BTS Time and again and many times he ranged the horse up to the gate in the effort to close it and each time the horse became frightened and backed and plunged away
BTS They will become art-lovers
BTS It soared upward with a swift rush till it reached its topmost note where it persisted palpitant and tense and then slowly died away
BTS Once again I undid all my work by lowering the mast into the water
BTS White Fang did not give the alarm by barking
BTS But my voice was a strange voice and in it he recognized nothing familiar
BTS Before him was smiling country streaming with sunshine lazy with quietude
BTS The comrades of the Fighting Groups were heroes all and the peculiar thing about it was that they were opposed to the taking of life
BTS Avaricious farmers hunted him with shot-guns
BTS And then a deer a many-pronged buck the sun flashing red-gold from neck and shoulders cleared the crest of the ridge before us and was gone
BTS ' I asked
BTS He stopped to listen to it then he finished his sentence with a wave of his hand toward the sound of the cry  one of them
BTS We agreed that this surplus could only be disposed of abroad
BTS At last I am a consecrated spirit
BTS You are a very good lawyer but you are a poor historian you know nothing of sociology and your biology is contemporaneous with Pliny
BTS One of the hunters a little dark-eyed man whom his mates called Smoke was telling stories liberally intersprinkled with oaths and obscenities
BTS Besides she added haltingly it's your idea and I want to see you succeed
BTS What tools and materials do you require
BTS Chapter II
BTS he demanded of Harrison
BTS And at first I thought he had some show too
BTS It was unreal
BTS And then there was the windlass
BTS It was the end of the third day of a fierce storm which had swung around the compass from the south-east to the north-west and which was then blowing directly in upon us
BTS Those snaps were always delivered on the empty air
BTS He went down past the blasted pine crossed the open space and trotted in amongst the trees
BTS The incumbents refused to get out
BTS I nodded my head but said We'll all win back to San Francisco Leach and you'll be with me when I go to see Matt McCarthy
BTS So he went out of his way to be especially kind to the Fighting Wolf
BTS It was a perilous undertaking for at a height of over a hundred feet from the deck holding on by their hands they were not in the best of positions to protect themselves from Mugridge's feet
BTS Won't that fix it
BTS Please
BTS Didn't you see the reporters scribbling like mad while he was speaking
BTS And thus he learned that there was no taboo on jackrabbits
BTS and in this fashion Buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence
BTS Nevertheless it will make a great impression what the Bishop did and said to-night I said
BTS Calvin's face lighted up
BTS You are usurping one of my prerogatives
BTS She strove bravely to hide it from me but while I was kindling another fire I knew she was stifling her sobs in the blankets under the sail-tent
BTS He has been too severely touched
BTS Hammerfield paused and cleared his throat--something that cannot be defined comprehensively except to such minds and temperaments as are philosophical
BTS You won't fool me as you did in the lazarette
BTS I left the oar long enough to tuck the blankets about her feet and to pull a single fold across her face
BTS The breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations with one another
BTS and the second day saw them booming up the Yukon well on their way to Pelly
BTS He loved to run down dry watercourses and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the woods
BTS but the life that is demanding to be born is limitless
BTS It began to look as though the battle were over
BTS For an hour I saw nothing but the naked desolate sea
BTS The skin roof stretched tightly as a drumhead I had thought sagged and bellied with every gust
BTS The official permission to occupy Wake Robin Lodge is still on the records signed by no less a man than Wickson the minor oligarch of the Manuscript
BTS You ketch um dog you take um all right was his last word
BTS You have nothing in common with the working class
BTS Who steals my purse steals my right to live was the reply old saws to the contrary
BTS There he sat gentle and stolid and somnolent
BTS The fun was over until the next steamer should arrive
BTS On either side the deck against the rail and bottoms up were lashed a number of small boats
BTS Yes sir Beauty Smith snarled
BTS It was at this time that my father disappeared
BTS Maud held the turn on the windlass and coiled down while I heaved
BTS for Buck made three of him in weight while his head barely reached Buck's shoulder
BTS Kowalt and Mr
BTS One devil dat Spitz remarked Perrault
BTS and one after the other they drew back streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders
BTS The time went by and the suspense to me was terrible
BTS and you are crying to live here and now not hereafter
BTS He had broken through the melting snow crust and wallowed while the snowshoe rabbits had skimmed along on top lightly as ever
BTS In the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country sad and silent where wildfowl had been but where then there was no life nor sign of life only the blowing of chill winds the forming of ice in sheltered places and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches
BTS This man was called Beauty by the other men of the fort
BTS Scott cried out through the darkness
BTS I could hear the explosions of their mines and bombs and see the smoke of their conflagrations and that was all
BTS but at any rate the mob took a cross street to the west turned down the next street and came back upon its track heading south toward the great ghetto
BTS It sticks out all over your mug
BTS get rid of them
BTS 'Tis the hand of God I'm tellin' you is the way Louis sees it
BTS As Buck sprang to punish him the lash of Francois's whip sang through the air reaching the culprit first
BTS No one ever came there not even the village boys of Glen Ellen
BTS or he would crouch for hours as if in concealment behind fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees wide-eyed and wide-eared to all that moved and sounded about him
BTS We in turn had countered this move
BTS Once in the fastnesses they promised and the two men could defy Wolf Larsen
BTS To the south a monster conflagration was filling the sky and we knew that the great ghetto was burning
BTS He did not know that it was a wolverine standing outside all a-trembling with its own daring and cautiously scenting out the contents of the cave
BTS On May 21 1905 A
BTS If otherwise then the only conclusion I could reach was that the sensitive skin recognized the difference of temperature between shade and sunshine
BTS There were times when several dogs pitching on to him punished him before he could get away
BTS And when all was done I gave up like a woman and rolled upon the deck in the agony of exhaustion
BTS He shoved and shoved hard till the grating of the steel against the locked teeth could be distinctly heard
BTS One Eye watching felt a sudden moistness in his mouth and a drooling of saliva involuntary excited by the living meat that was spreading itself like a repast before him
BTS I am so tired so tired
BTS The captain had thrust his head and shoulders out of the pilot-house and was staring intently into the fog as though by sheer force of will he could penetrate it
BTS And romantic it certainly was the fog like the grey shadow of infinite mystery brooding over the whirling speck of earth
BTS I had come down to the deck and I saw Horner and Kerfoot vainly protest against the attempt
BTS You cannot diminish the length of his living by killing him for he is without beginning or end
BTS But the clubbing
BTS God's hero
BTS Thornton did not reply
BTS I do know now that we shall go clear
BTS Beside her on the floor was a pile of trousers
BTS In the suburbs the morning papers came on board the train
BTS Smoke the irrepressible related a story and they descended into the steerage bellowing with laughter
BTS ha
BTS Weedon Scott was in truth this thumb
BTS I was wild with desire like a child with a new toy to hoist something with my shears
BTS No Wolf Larsen answered with an indescribable air of sadness
BTS She was too subtle not to follow the trend of my silence
BTS nor could she gain on him so great was his terror nor could he leave her so great was her madness
BTS The men were foredoomed
BTS Nevertheless in violation of the national and state constitutions and by means of conspiracy on the parts of the governors of Idaho and Colorado Moyer and Haywood were kidnapped thrown into jail and charged with the murder
BTS The ptarmigan dragged him out of the bush
BTS He talked soothingly to him but not for long then slowly put out his hand rested it on White Fang's head and resumed the interrupted patting
BTS You'd have robbed him most probably I answered
BTS There were no more idle-rich young men
BTS And now with the love-master his snuggling was the deliberate act of putting himself into a position of hopeless helplessness
BTS For my sake she begged
BTS and I am afraid in my mind because I do not wish to die
BTS The large capitalists the trusts in short will not let you turn back
BTS The machine stopped for a moment just abreast of us
BTS This he took in good part and was really pleased nodding his head with direful foreknowledge and mystery until George Leach the erstwhile cabin-boy ventured some rough pleasantry on the subject
BTS For some time we remained in this position without a change in the situation
BTS Across the street and half a block down high up in a building I could see heads peering out
BTS Herford and Guinness were in it and they were blown to pieces along with the field into which they fell
BTS Has the Church protested
BTS As the time went by he had fewer and fewer fights
BTS and Buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to rest
BTS Beyond a growl or a grunt the dog took its punishment silently
BTS I begged her with my eyes to go below but she smiled and said We may be feeble land-creatures without legs but we can show Captain Larsen that we are at least as brave as he
BTS The cub entertained a great respect for his mother
BTS Each night the dogs were attended to first
BTS he cried
BTS He spoke softly to White Fang until he had quieted him then his voice became firm
BTS Every member had his work to do in the world and this work he was compelled to do
BTS He became an adept at fighting
BTS Her appreciation of the ridiculous was keen and in all things she unerringly saw and felt where it existed the touch of sham the overshading the overtone
BTS Even the hunters were pulling and with three pairs of oars in the water they rapidly overhauled what I may appropriately term the enemy
BTS I'm a paralytic now
BTS Go up on deck
BTS Mr
BTS Certainly he answered
BTS You herd with the capitalist class in another locality
BTS The faint sound of Thornton's voice came to them and though they could not make out the words of it they knew that he was in his extremity
BTS When I aroused it was as after centuries of time
BTS His face brightened
BTS For weeks and months he never made a sound in the black silence eating his very soul
BTS and in the latter there was no glint of laughter
BTS One Eye half arose in his excitement his ears up his tail straight out and quivering behind him
BTS Gun in hand he plunged into the underbrush that lined the side of the trail
BTS And the men went early to bed Bill first seeing to it that the dogs were tied out of gnawing-reach of one another
BTS These noises were not indication of danger the cub decided as he crouched near his mother still bristling from time to time but doing his best to submit
BTS The revolutionists everywhere are calling her the Red Virgin
BTS I asked the maid in the dressing-room how late the train was and she told me two hours
BTS She clasped hands about knees rocking back and forth broken-heartedly
BTS Good-bye Lucifer proud spirit Maud whispered so low that it was drowned by the shouting of the wind
BTS Unlike Skeet who was wont to shove her nose under Thornton's hand and nudge and nudge till petted or Nig who would stalk up and rest his great head on Thornton's knee Buck was content to adore at a distance
BTS Hundreds an' hundreds an' children too
BTS What ho
BTS Where's the pot
BTS From the sounds on deck I knew that the sailors had been routed out and were preparing to lower the boats
BTS My mind recoils from contemplation of what they may crystallize into
BTS But it was then that the unexpected happened the thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future past many a weary mile of trail and toil
BTS My memory of riding in the automobile is very hazy though this ride in turn is broken by one vivid picture
BTS Johnson was a splendid seaman and he knew as much about small boats as he did about ships
BTS and on the underside of our booms drops of water took shape in long swaying lines which were detached and flung to the deck in mimic showers at each surge of the schooner
BTS The bell which had seemed straight ahead was now sounding from the side
BTS Wot's 'e been s'yin' to yer
BTS To think was patently an effort
BTS They made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the craters of extinct volcanoes and late that night pulled into the huge camp at the head of Lake Bennett where thousands of goldseekers were building boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring
BTS But I must give the events in their proper sequence
BTS To the feet was attached the sack of coal which the cook had fetched
BTS Before his eyes closed the wolves had drawn too near for safety
BTS Proletariat Derived originally from the Latin PROLETARII the name given in the census of Servius Tullius to those who were of value to the state only as the rearers of offspring PROLES
BTS Of course I couldn't accept it under the circumstances
BTS A third and answering cry arose also to the rear and to the left of the second cry
BTS Nothing was too great for Buck to do when Thornton commanded
BTS Still further other groups of comrades at the signal were to seize the officers of the Mercenaries and the police as well as all Oligarchs of unusual ability or who held executive positions
BTS He could not help it
BTS The she-wolf sat down in the snow and old One Eye now more in fear of his mate than of the mysterious sapling again sprang for the rabbit
BTS Shall I look for him in the steerage sir
BTS Heaven only knows now where and when the Revolution will triumph
BTS As I felt about among his blankets something hot fell on the back of my hand
BTS But he insisted on his own privacy and self-seclusion and so thoroughly ignored Dick that that good-natured creature finally gave him up and scarcely took as much interest in him as in the hitching-post near the stable
BTS If the desire to remain sober prevails it is because it is the strongest desire
BTS Thus throughout the organization of the Oligarchy our own organization weblike and spidery was insinuating itself
BTS There was no telling what unknown terrors were theirs what unknown hurts they could administer
BTS Humphrey
BTS Weedon Scott waved a last good-bye
BTS But you'll 'ave to make them do till I dry yours out by the fire
BTS When I was a young man I was a soldier was his answer
BTS All Endeavour Island brightened under the sun
BTS Then I saw red again
BTS The machinery of society was in the hands of those who were bent on breaking him
BTS Then they gave up letting the boat drift till a second boat sent from the shore by Wolf Larsen took them in tow and brought them aboard
BTS I remember how he forced the hunter and his two men below a rifle at their breasts when their captain passed by at biscuit-toss and hailed us for information
BTS Let's go back I said dejectedly
BTS But I've said nothin' to ye mind ye
BTS Every street was a canyon every building a mountain
BTS Biedenbach with tears in his eyes held that Wickson must die and was quite relieved when we outvoted him and his horrible proposition
BTS Through our secret service we ransacked every prison in the land
BTS Yet Bishop Morehouse was not aware of it
BTS Pocock won his spurs as a slave-driver and earned the undying hatred of the proletariat
BTS As it was it made me quite squeamish though this nausea might have been due to the pain of my leg and exhaustion
BTS Cheer up
BTS But still I had feared him blind and helpless and listening always listening and I never let his strong arms get within reach of me while I worked
BTS It broke us
BTS When one was beaten into insensibility or killed the survivor took the money
BTS The dominant colour was grey and yet there was to it a faint reddish hue a hue that was baffling that appeared and disappeared that was more like an illusion of the vision now grey distinctly grey and again giving hints and glints of a vague redness of colour not classifiable in terms of ordinary experience
BTS Also I was very thankful as I put the gun away and slipped back on deck
BTS You can't do it
BTS Py jingo
BTS It's chaos
BTS It was the first of the many fights he was to have with Lip-lip for they were enemies from the start born so with natures destined perpetually to clash
BTS But there was no more loafing
BTS I thought something was wrong
BTS I recognized this with relief
BTS It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work
BTS He was on his feet flinging his arms his rhetoric and his control to the winds alternately abusing Ernest for his youth and demagoguery and savagely attacking the working class elaborating its inefficiency and worthlessness
BTS Thus sticks and stones directed by these strange creatures leaped through the air like living things inflicting grievous hurts upon the dogs
BTS and in the woods side by side White Fang ran with Collie as his mother Kiche and old One Eye had run long years before in the silent Northland forest
BTS He passed out of the forest and into the moonlit open where were no shadows nor darknesses
BTS At last was being realized Karl Marx's classic The knell of private capitalist property sounds
BTS he shouted
BTS I cried aloud in my vexation
BTS Heave in
BTS He is up in the air with all kinds of ethical delusions and plans for mission work among the cultured
BTS I alone in the midst of a score of men was the only person unmasked
BTS Half an hour passed an hour
BTS Diamonds and rubies are gone spread out on the deck to be washed away by a bucket of sea-water and he does not even know that the diamonds and rubies are gone
BTS Do you feed yourself
BTS Encouragement and advice were freely tendered and Jock Horner the quiet self-spoken hunter who looked as though he would not harm a mouse advised me to leave the ribs alone and to thrust upward for the abdomen at the same time giving what he called the Spanish twist to the blade
BTS Which is all by the way for you are wrong
BTS At any moment they were liable to be overwhelmed by the hissing combers
BTS I noticed as we talked over his condition that Maud's sympathy went out to him more and more
BTS Several months later we rode him on one of his father's horses over Sonoma Mountains to Petaluma Creek and embarked him in a small fishing-launch
BTS Prove it he challenged
BTS Do you know it sometimes makes me afraid
BTS The Bishop straightened himself in his chair and over his gentle face spread the harshness of the warrior
BTS She is also patriotic
BTS Cooky cannot hurt you
BTS For days his manifestations of desire to lay hands on him had been growing more insistent and during that time White Fang had been compelled to avoid the camp
BTS Take him outside
BTS On the contrary it was increasing
BTS The greatness of sensation is mutual
BTS They were the first warning that I was on a lee shore
BTS Toward the end I heard her moving about within the hut making her toilet
BTS There was no escaping that grip
BTS The dark sun-bronze of his face went black with wrath his eyes were ablaze
BTS And the marvel of it was that still he lived and clung to life
BTS When a halt was made they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs and the spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out
BTS Incidentally new facts were learned about the nature size and form of the earth and the Ptolemaic system went glimmering
BTS My hands however are a spectacle for grief
BTS half an inch
BTS On the way to town hanging around the saloon at the cross-roads were three dogs that made a practice of rushing out upon him when he went by
BTS He was wise and yet in the nature of him there were forces greater than wisdom
BTS but I made shift with the tin used for bailing the boat and later as we consumed our supply of canned goods we accumulated quite an imposing array of cooking vessels
BTS It was an even choice between this and the west-north-westerly course which the wind permitted
BTS She rubbed the dimness hastily out of them
BTS Ernest turned abruptly on Mr
BTS A Scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates and in company with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to Dawson
BTS No matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by tree or bank the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward sheltered and snug
BTS I chucked off the belt with my right hand he said an' made a reach for the flint with my left
BTS In truth there was very little reasoning or none at all
BTS By midday though we were well up in the northerly latitudes the heat was sickening
BTS Just wait and see was the answer
BTS He saw the women and children passing in and out of them without harm and he saw the dogs trying often to get into them and being driven away with sharp words and flying stones
BTS The game of revolution was a game of life and death and mere accessories were traps
BTS Maud's footsteps were very near as his hand fluttered for the last time and my throat was released
BTS White Fang had never seen dogs before but at sight of them he felt that they were his own kind only somehow different
BTS You pulled aside the veils from the social shams
BTS Was this present life of a revolutionist hiding in a hole a nightmare
BTS But there was life abroad in the land and defiant
BTS It has no value
BTS You'll be all right in half-an-hour he assured me
BTS In the morning Henry was aroused by fervid blasphemy that proceeded from the mouth of Bill
BTS To those who believe in Jesus and his gospel there can be no other relation between man and man than the relation of affection
BTS White Fang did not reason it out did not in his mind make the sharp generalisation that the white gods were more powerful
BTS In the old days he would have sprung upon White Fang in a fury of righteous wrath
BTS Had Grey Beaver possessed the plummet of affection and love he might have sounded the deeps of White Fang's nature and brought up to the surface all manner of kindly qualities
BTS CHAPTER X My intimacy with Wolf Larsen increases if by intimacy may be denoted those relations which exist between master and man or better yet between king and jester
BTS No man ate of the seal meat or the oil
BTS nor were beaver mending their dams too wary
BTS But the first man on Mars would have experienced less unfamiliarity than did he
BTS while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled
BTS Because he was morose and solitary having nothing to do with the other dogs he was unusually fitted to guard his master's property
BTS Nor could I more than roughly guess our latitude and longitude
BTS He shook it but his hand felt clammy
BTS Do not be downcast Ernest said
BTS After our secret meeting we got in touch with the national organization and soon our code cables were passing back and forth across the Atlantic between us and the International Bureau
BTS He had never fought before with a dog with which he could not close
BTS I shall prove the contrary was the retort
BTS They sledded seventy miles up the Yukon swung to the left into the Stewart River passed the Mayo and the McQuestion and held on until the Stewart itself became a streamlet threading the upstanding peaks which marked the backbone of the continent
BTS Why not give them a change of treatment
BTS Nothing
BTS There is no such thing as a conflict of interest between labor and capital--or rather there ought not to be
BTS she retorted
BTS We had been having a heated discussion upon life of course and grown over-bold I was passing stiff strictures upon Wolf Larsen and the life of Wolf Larsen
BTS But it did not all happen in a day this giving over of himself body and soul to the man-animals
BTS It was so thick in the confined space that I was compelled to feel my way
BTS Throw it into the sea
BTS Pour it over your tongue till it tingles with it
BTS I thought so
BTS At first in a mild way he had dabbled in philosophy
BTS I held on to the rail with one hand and supported her weight with the other and I was proud at the moment of the feat
BTS Everybody broke out into roars of laughter
BTS For when the weather was fair and we were in the midst of the herd all hands were away in the boats and left on board were only he and I and Thomas Mugridge who did not count
BTS And I will answer for you that you were afraid
BTS They went across divides in summer blizzards shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast
BTS I stopped the carriage got out and after a few minutes' conversation persuaded two of the public women to get into the brougham with me
BTS Then we will know for certainty
BTS Nor will the eternal movelessness that is coming to me be made easier or harder by the sacrifices or selfishnesses of the time when I was yeasty and acrawl
BTS It is because I am afraid the flesh is afraid
BTS I'll tell you what I'll do he challenged finally
BTS I promise  To obey as a sailor would obey his captain
BTS When they came near with their ominous hands he got up
BTS He could hear the snarl of Kiche as she fought for him
BTS Two by two male and female the wolves were deserting
BTS Old tub
BTS But our own nascent secret service was beginning to work
BTS He was my same lover-husband and hero
BTS I am so afraid
BTS His only food was meat live meat that ran away swiftly before him or flew into the air or climbed trees or hid in the ground or faced him and fought with him or turned the tables and ran after him
BTS He closed on the canvas with his teeth and gave a gentle tug
BTS There are other plans afoot was the retort
BTS and because of this they became sharp of speech and hard words were first on their lips in the morning and last at night
BTS Hammerfield's discomfiture complete
BTS How piteously brave
BTS Feebly my own limbs were helping me
BTS The latter's breath was drawn with greater and greater difficulty as the moments went by
BTS They alone were alive and they sought for other things that were alive in order that they might devour them and continue to live
BTS You know me for what I am my worth in the world by your standard
BTS Was it not liable to go to pieces at any moment
BTS I was pardonably curious in my survey for it appeared my fate to be pent up with them on this miniature floating world for I knew not how many weeks or months
BTS And besides his swashbuckling was a fine thing to see
BTS much remained to be done and when the Revolt was precipitated of course it was doomed to failure
BTS But Cherokee did not seem anxious to fight
BTS Billee's one fault was his excessive good nature while Joe was the very opposite sour and introspective with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye
BTS Mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded comprehensively it was all so very simple
BTS Bound down a prisoner denied even movement by the plaster casts and bandages White Fang lingered out the weeks
BTS And as he said it seemed God hated him too much to let him die for he ultimately grew better and waxed more malignant than ever
BTS No White Fang was not for sale at any price
BTS With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased
BTS I was so terror-stricken by this fight in the dark that I leaned against the ladder trembling and unable to ascend
BTS Because of his discoveries he was banished from his native country and he died an exile in England
BTS The wind drove them back and not only over me but over Henderson and Wolf Larsen
BTS I'll tell you what to do Ernest said
BTS And half the night we sat up over it
BTS when he remained still it remained still and he concluded it was safer to continue remaining still
BTS This was warfare in that modern jungle a great city
BTS Where's that boy
BTS Tell me
BTS His soft snarl grew tense and harsh
BTS I descended to the lower deck
BTS As a result having learned the lesson well White Fang was hard put whenever he passed the cross-roads saloon
BTS And I thought I had that much left in me
BTS It is revolting
BTS She is an old woman
BTS After a few days sober and bankrupt Grey Beaver departed up the Porcupine on his long journey to the Mackenzie
BTS Chicago is shut off
BTS I want to ask you some questions
BTS According to its capitalist system of industry it has an unconsumed surplus that must be got rid of and that must be got rid of abroad
BTS White Fang shrank together and grew tense as he crouched under it
BTS into other industrial companies
BTS The strange god walked softly but more softly walked White Fang for he had no clothes to rub against the flesh of his body
BTS They were set apart from the rest of labor
BTS Never mind the destruction of life and property
BTS But there was Jackson and Jackson's arm and the blood that stained my gown and dripped from my own roof-beams
BTS Colonel Ingram was brilliant at cross-examination
BTS Thus in the early morning instead of roaming and foraging or lying in a sheltered nook he would wait for hours on the cheerless cabin-stoop for a sight of the god's face
BTS Still I could not see the expediency of the manoeuvre for the free sea was still intercepted by the Macedonia's five weather boats which in turn had hauled close on the wind
BTS No
BTS and the curse of it is that I must lie here conscious mentally unimpaired knowing that the lines are going down breaking bit by bit communication with the world
BTS The Bishop was silent and for once Ernest forbore to press the point
BTS They send them to jail
BTS for a living dog is better than a dead lion
BTS He picked one up from the pan
BTS Nowhere did the raw earth appear
BTS Pike and Dub followed on his heels with the rest of the team behind
BTS Wolf Larsen I said sternly for the first time addressing him by this his most familiar name I am unable to shoot a helpless unresisting man
BTS What do you think
BTS They don't know the meanin' of it
BTS And different was the method of driving the dogs
BTS I sprang up the break of the poop and saw Wolf Larsen
BTS The ropes of varying length prevented the dogs attacking from the rear those that ran in front of them
BTS and besides whatever new situation arose it could not possibly be worse than the present one
BTS It was due to his whim that I was detained aboard in the first place
BTS I had already determined to I said coldly
BTS I'll wager every man Jack of them is over the side to-morrow hunting for Wolf Larsen as contentedly as ever they hunted for Death Larsen
BTS It was the poor hunted wretch that had dragged himself past my hiding-place
BTS The boat we were pursuing had squared away and was running before the wind to escape us and in the course of its flight to take part in repulsing our general boat attack
BTS He thought he had me inside
BTS You cowards
BTS As his teeth crunched through the tender flesh and fragile bones he began naturally to eat
BTS It was all that was left of Spanker the stick with which he had been tied
BTS His fist shot out striking the woman between her burning eyes
BTS There was no time to investigate
BTS but this is certainly what Wolf Larsen is doing
BTS They were all about him and upon him
BTS I was a suspect--a word of fear that all revolutionists were soon to come to know
BTS My mighty rhythm was the lift and forward plunge of a ship on the sea
BTS And still she pleaded with me not to cast off the masts
BTS All was ready and we were in the cave-room that served for kitchen and dining room when Ernest opened the door and entered
BTS England's hands were full
BTS My impression of him the first time I saw him had been unfavorable
BTS There were many of us in the various secret services of the Oligarchy and despite the shakings-up and reorganizations the secret services have undergone they have never been able to weed all of us out
BTS Later on two Indians arrived
BTS ' There's not a man among 'em to-day to take a drink with me if I asked him
BTS Only Louis refrained no more than cautiously wetting his lips with the liquor though he joined in the revels with an abandon equal to that of most of them
BTS White Fang tried to draw the thong softly out of his master's hand
BTS I called to her and the mast moved easily and accurately
BTS It is not beautiful I protested
BTS His outlook was bleak and materialistic
BTS Thus as token of what a puppet thing life is the ancient song surged through him and he came into his own again
BTS They ate before the drivers ate and no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the feet of the dogs he drove
BTS An' there was a man the same year he killed with a blow iv his fist
BTS He walked as delicately as though all the snow were carpeted with porcupine quills erect and ready to pierce the soft pads of his feet
BTS when the warp and the woof of him had made of him an adamantine texture harsh and unyielding
BTS but I considered and refrained
BTS Thus a large company could sell at a loss for a longer period than a small company and so drive the small company out of business
BTS I involuntarily cried
BTS That night when all was still White Fang remembered his mother and sorrowed for her
BTS He shook himself but more of it fell upon him
BTS He saw the blaze of the fire Kloo-kooch cooking and Grey Beaver squatting on his hams and mumbling a chunk of raw tallow
BTS was Leach's crafty answer strained from him in a smothered sort of way
BTS From the camp came the faint sound of many voices rising and falling in a sing-song chant
BTS Many things were to occur simultaneously when the signal went forth
BTS There was a great deal of effort about their manner but no businesslike method
BTS I confess that a madness seized me that I shrieked aloud as the women had shrieked and beat the water with my numb hands
BTS My left arm was numb as though paralysed and days passed before I could use it while weeks went by before the last stiffness and pain went out of it
BTS I was one of those that tried him and passed sentence upon him
BTS Pandemonium broke out again
BTS But it was not Wolf Larsen's whim to annihilate him
BTS It is terrible
BTS In truth Harrison was very sick as a person is sea-sick
BTS But now could I sit still for one half-hour and do nothing not even think it would be the most pleasurable thing in the world
BTS Ere they returned to camp he knew enough to stop at ho to go ahead at mush to swing wide on the bends and to keep clear of the wheeler when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels
BTS Two nights later came the act but on a more generous scale than the master had anticipated
BTS I harm no one
BTS First of all father was discharged from the university
BTS profit
BTS But the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more fundamental and primitive code
BTS while I armed could always forestall him should he attempt to grapple me with his terrible gorilla arms
BTS Half-a-dozen sailors swarmed to the crosstrees after him where they clustered and waited while two of their number Oofty-Oofty and Black who was Latimer's boat-steerer continued up the thin steel stays lifting their bodies higher and higher by means of their arms
BTS And then when the labor leaders had left Ernest with the calmness of defeat outlined to me the course of events to come
BTS He was suspicious of them
BTS No chain nor stick bound him
BTS From these experiences he became suspicious of all children
BTS It was some of the blood from that arm that I heard dripping from your roof-beams Ernest said with continued gentleness
BTS She had now caught the bosom-breathing of the ocean and was herself a-breath with the rhythm of it as she smoothly mounted and slipped down each broad-backed wave
BTS It's a dark business from the way you hide it Ernest said with growing anger
BTS They went away together leaving me smarting with a sense of injustice that had been done me and my class
BTS He performed his mental arithmetic aloud
BTS CHAPTER XXV You've been on deck Mr
BTS Yet his time came in the end in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck could not understand
BTS But I didn't tell my wife
BTS One boat lowered away with the plugs out filled with women and children and then with water and capsized
BTS That gives them all the more significance
BTS When she forced him too hard he was compelled to go about in a circle his shoulder presented to her his head turned from her and on his face and in his eyes a patient and bored expression
BTS I did it
BTS There was the organization of the mouth-to-mouth propaganda
BTS He did not look at things with wide vision
BTS He had earned it and he would not be content with less
BTS A dozen times he charged and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down
BTS And then I am lonely
BTS White Fang tried to face it
BTS Keep a stout heart were his parting words
BTS Nothing is sacred to him nothing is too terrible for him to do
BTS So we must get ashore without swimming in some opening between the rocks through which we can drive the boat and clamber out
BTS The Rev
BTS I did it
BTS It was soft and bled easily
BTS Chicago lay dead
BTS It seemed as though some great cosmic thing lay dead
BTS Then he would seize brands from the fire and hurl them into the pack
BTS Buck tightened the traces then slacked them for a matter of several inches
BTS Amidst the crashing of the middle men the small business men and manufacturers the trusts stood firm
BTS The bull-dog was bleeding back of one ear from a rip in his thick neck
BTS but when both bestowed their attentions at the same time she was roughly jostled being compelled with quick snaps to either side to drive both lovers away and at the same time to maintain her forward leap with the pack and see the way of her feet before her
BTS Possibly because of some fault that had occurred when the knolls were flung together and certainly helped by freakish erosion the hole had been scooped out in the course of centuries by the wash of water
BTS And first last and most of all he hated Beauty Smith
BTS Mr
BTS Labor furnished labor
BTS Her sister seconded her and a chorus of approval arose from around the table
BTS I could see Maud's solicitude again growing though she timidly and even proudly I think forbore a repetition of her request
BTS Gold in the form of securities and bonds and so forth Mr
BTS For 'tis in the bones iv me I know that come this time next year I'll be gazin' in the old mother's eyes weary with watchin' iv the sea for the five sons she gave to it
BTS Don't you
BTS And yet he left the chair in full leap without first gaining a standing position
BTS These reactionary groups attacked the revolutionary groups and also at needed moments rioted and destroyed property so as to afford the Autocracy the pretext of calling out the Cossacks
BTS You want opportunity to plunder your fellow-men in your own small way but you hypnotize yourselves into thinking you want freedom
BTS Yet you feel the pressure of other combinations on you the trust combinations and you cry out
BTS They're lazy I tell you and you've got to whip them to get anything out of them
BTS He must be away free on his own legs touching no living thing
BTS Dis is de las'
BTS An unsatisfactory correspondence followed
BTS When the word goes forth the labor hosts of all the world shall rise
BTS Maud still watched from the tent
BTS You never had the proletariat Ernest cried
BTS How in hell did he know it was you in the dark
BTS History was making fast
BTS And I was frightened when I became conscious of the trend of my thought
BTS It is not strange Salmon Tongue Grey Beaver answered
BTS It had been an irresistible attraction before ever his eyes opened and looked upon it
BTS They were too confident
BTS Then he was carried aft and flung into the sea
BTS I looked again but could not see them
BTS but did not my brother tie her out in the woods all of three nights in the mating season
BTS Cooky Wolf Larsen called in a low voice
BTS The stage was set for a world-catastrophe for in all the world were hard times labor troubles perishing middle classes armies of unemployed clashes of economic interests in the world-market and mutterings and rumblings of the socialist revolution
BTS The boy pursued him and he a stranger in the village fled between two tepees to find himself cornered against a high earth bank
BTS During this period there were many ministers cast out of the church for preaching unacceptable doctrine
BTS Coward that I might be I was less a coward than he
BTS Oh believe me my anger means nothing
BTS The peculiar knowledge of the pilot and captain sufficed for many thousands of people who knew no more of the sea and navigation than I knew
BTS but he was too old in the world to forget his caution
BTS He became my oracle
BTS But they'll come to it they'll come to it an' be sorry the day they was born
BTS The silence was painful
BTS But first you must be more warmly clad
BTS Then he rolled over on his side his head resting on the biceps of the under arm the forearm shielding his eyes from the sun
BTS No one knew what was happening
BTS But it was before this that father returned one afternoon
BTS Can the United States do what she previously did--get rid of her surplus to Brazil
BTS Even your present wealth is not a true measure of your power
BTS he cried but Buck refused to budge
BTS I had stood on my father's legs
BTS Then I looked at Wolf Larsen but there was nothing subjective about his state of consciousness
BTS But the next moment his footing would be lost and he would be dragging around in the whirl of one of White Fang's mad gyrations
BTS Look here Mr
BTS Maud
BTS Everything in readiness I made a line fast to the apex of the shears and carried it directly to the windlass
BTS their capacity to change the very face of the world
BTS I looked quickly at Wolf Larsen
BTS I was aware of a hungry out-reaching for her as of a starving man for bread
BTS Agents-provocateurs all right was the officer's conclusion
BTS I shall not take the vacation
BTS I shall never forget the evening he brought home his street pedler's outfit of shoe-laces and suspenders nor the time I went into the little corner grocery to make some purchase and had him wait on me
BTS Clerks in the express office took charge of him
BTS I often marvel these days at the immense quantity of potatoes two or three hundred thousand dollars will buy or bread or meat or coal and kindling
BTS The dog's mine
BTS I thought of our snug little huts our supplies of meat and oil and moss and firewood and I knew that we could never survive the wintry sea and the great storms which were to come
BTS Eh
BTS Nothing happened
BTS That is why the workingmen will have nothing to do with the Church
BTS There seemed untold numbers of these white men
BTS They will not count
BTS We knew she carried fourteen boats to our five we were one short through the desertion of Wainwright and she began dropping them far to leeward of our last boat continued dropping them athwart our course and finished dropping them far to windward of our first weather boat
BTS The tent was rolled into an awkward bundle three times as large as it should have been
BTS for the eyes dimly intelligent were looking at me and seeing me
BTS had gone up the steps and lain down to one side of the porch still growling and keeping a sullen watch on the intruder
BTS he had lived a long strong life full of fight and struggle and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees
BTS Nor did I for an instant take my eyes off him
BTS Are you hungry
BTS I wish you wouldn't she said
BTS It was a harness such as he had seen the grooms put on the horses at home
BTS 'I hope you are happy
BTS It is hard to maintain one's dignity under such circumstances
BTS It was the creation of Miss Brentwood an enormously wealthy old maid
BTS This man talked with Manuel and money chinked between them
BTS But Buck did not read the newspapers and he did not know that Manuel one of the gardener's helpers was an undesirable acquaintance
BTS But I was too occupied to acknowledge her delight
BTS I'll bet you a month's pay he acts upon it
BTS What of the hard times and the consequent vast army of the unemployed
BTS Hartman was hopeless over the situation
BTS I thought of the ship's stores and the lazarette beneath the cabin and the idea came to me of surprising Maud with something nice for breakfast
BTS And they were without real morality--for instance that which Christ had preached but which was no longer preached
BTS But in the meantime God did not come and they starved to death in great numbers
BTS But I called up all my resolution set my teeth and hobbled back and forth from galley to cabin and cabin to galley without further mishap
BTS and if they have never done this before still I can do it
BTS I had selected it
BTS Power
BTS Let us first of all investigate a particular industrial process and whenever I state something with which you disagree please interrupt me
BTS He paused and looked at me and added Social evolution is exasperatingly slow isn't it sweetheart
BTS I had not yet had a glimmering of unconsciousness and it seemed that an interminable period of time was lapsing before I heard her feet flying back
BTS I noted that the hunter a huge Scandinavian sitting in the bow held his rifle ready to hand across his knees
BTS I knew not what had aroused me but I found myself out of my bunk on my feet wide awake my soul vibrating to the warning of danger as it might have thrilled to a trumpet call
BTS Cold and grey and glittering they were as he bowed brusquely and turned away
BTS I hated him then and consoled myself with the thought that his behavior was what was to be expected from a man of the working class
BTS she asked detecting the anxious glance I had shot at the object of our conversation and impressed I flatter myself with the earnestness of my manner
BTS It was harder to kill a husky dog than them
BTS Nature spills it out with a lavish hand
BTS There is to-day no doubt whatever that the Iron Heel was responsible for the bomb that exploded in the House of Representatives in 1913 A
BTS Let him go Leach commanded
BTS Since the finding of the Manuscript excavations have been made and the house the two cave rooms and all the accumulated rubbish of long occupancy have been brought to light
BTS Why we could sail away in her
BTS Whether it divined that it was being driven toward the lake or whether it was merely a blind squirm of the monster I do not know
BTS About seventy he answered
BTS He walked to the centre of the open space and listened
BTS Fifteen-two fifteen-four an' a pair makes six Mat was pegging up when there was an outcry and sound of snarling without
BTS Good for Mugridge
BTS I did not see into the eyes of Leach for he was looking at Wolf Larsen the old and implacable snarl of hatred strong as ever on his face
BTS I held out my hand
BTS The she-wolf flirted her head like the snap of a whip breaking the weasel's hold and flinging it high in the air
BTS Now it bound him with insentient fetters walling his soul in darkness and silence blocking it from the world which to him had been a riot of action
BTS And I wondered if she too felt it as we walked along the deck side by side to where the stalled foremast hung in the shears
BTS Clutching the woodwork of the galley for support and I confess the grease with which it was scummed put my teeth on edge I reached across a hot cooking-range to the offending utensil unhooked it and wedged it securely into the coal-box
BTS There was no clearness or sanity in them nothing but the terrific rage of a madman
BTS and I little I who had lived so placidly all my days in the quiet university town found myself and my personal affairs drawn into the vortex of the great world-affairs
BTS Weedon Scott listened
BTS the Iron Heel will walk upon our faces
BTS Then he strolled aft and we slipped forward
BTS But he reached for the flint and his arm was picked and clawed to shreds from the finger tips to the shoulder
BTS But Wolf Larsen as was to be expected being a boat short took possession of the first stray one and compelled its men to hunt with the Ghost not permitting them to return to their own schooner when we sighted it
BTS My biceps was being crushed to a pulp
BTS Growth is life and life is for ever destined to make for light
BTS he demanded bluntly
BTS I know that you will not vote for this bill Ernest went on
BTS It was his first glimpse of mankind
BTS You go to Sunday-school to learn what is right
BTS With that strong body of his he should be at work and not peddling I answered curtly
BTS but through it all following him persisted the howling
BTS He did not know White Fang's breed so for weapon he took a light buggy-whip
BTS This book Economics and Education was published in that year
BTS We've got six dogs the other reiterated dispassionately
BTS That night when supper was finished and they sat on the oblong box and pulled at their pipes the circle of gleaming eyes drew in even closer than before
BTS Can you lend me a thousand
BTS It's up to the editors
BTS I had noted the men in the forecastle
BTS But after all wealth in itself is not the real power
BTS That's my purpose
BTS Mugridge's parting injunction as I left the galley with a big tea-pot in one hand and in the hollow of the other arm several loaves of fresh-baked bread
BTS But this day as I noted them pacing up and down I saw that it was she who terminated the walk
BTS Garthwaite and the young officer fell into an animated conversation over the difference between so-called modern warfare and the present street-fighting and sky-scraper fighting that was taking place all over the city
BTS Nor was she above slashing his shoulder sharply on occasion
BTS You you  Go on Wolf Larsen prompted
BTS By crossing and lashing the ends of two spars and then elevating them in the air like an inverted V I could get a point above the deck to which to make fast my hoisting tackle
BTS Down with you
BTS I did not wish Maud's spirits to be dampened by such a find so I turned seaward again with our boat and skirted the north-eastern point of the island
BTS By the way Hump as I have remarked you are a handy man Wolf Larsen began when my work was done
BTS For several hours he adhered to this programme
BTS I asked pausing for the moment on the threshold
BTS There there children father said soothingly
BTS His head was buried in his hands and his shoulders were heaving convulsively as with sobs
BTS There was a playfulness about her nips and a gentleness that prevented them from really hurting him
BTS But we may be picked up any moment by a sealing-schooner
BTS The men toiled in the mines and fields--perforce they were no more than slaves
BTS ' And it was a newspaper poem she said glibly
BTS Two or three times he put his head into the galley and chaffed Mugridge good-naturedly and once this afternoon he stood by the break of the poop and chatted with him for fully fifteen minutes
BTS You were reprimanded for your private life
BTS With the exception of the prison pallor there was no change in him--at least not much
BTS What is the meaning of the fact that to-day the capitalists of the United States own hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of Mexican bonds Russian bonds Italian bonds Grecian bonds
BTS I was compelled to let go the sheet while I helped her to the nest of blankets and chafed her hands and arms
BTS All life likes power and Beauty Smith was no exception
BTS And next the sharp voice of an officer
BTS pension as soldiers those who grow honorably old in their toil and there will be no need for charity
BTS Men should be men not brutes
BTS White Fang clung with his fore-paws to the man's shoulders at the same time burying his fangs into the back of the man's neck
BTS A myriad laws governed all these things and determined conduct
BTS Not very much was his confession
BTS White Fang had done his work
BTS The aerial battle was over and Thomas Mugridge whining and gibbering his mouth flecked with bloody foam was brought down to deck
BTS He crossed the deck sprang into the fore rigging and began to climb
BTS And once and once only I saw an arm that moved in that dead stream
BTS Off the Farallones heading about sou-west he answered slowly and methodically as though groping for his best English and rigidly observing the order of my queries
BTS And the young man the son talked with me much about people and work and the robbery of the people by the capitalists
BTS Fear
BTS The men at the saloon even urged the dogs on to attack White Fang
BTS Unlike any one else in the ship's company I now found myself with no quarrels on my hands and in the good graces of all
BTS The ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life
BTS I'm afraid and I'm not afraid she chattered with shaking jaws
BTS Oh it hasn't subsidized all of the unions
BTS Purpose  I began
BTS I tried to reach it in a mad resolve to claw into the wood with my nails but my arms were heavy and lifeless
BTS The eyes of both of us I think were moist with the joy of success
BTS Louis demanded with Celtic fire
BTS You would not think so to look at him but he was quite unable to stand alone at first
BTS He feels it is his bounden duty to resurrect the ancient spirit of the Church and to deliver its message to the masters
BTS Servile and fawning as he had been before he was now as domineering and bellicose
BTS in short that which writhes in the body of a snake when the head is cut off and the snake as a snake is dead or which lingers in the shapeless lump of turtle-meat and recoils and quivers from the prod of a finger
BTS Asgard was not completed until 1984 A
BTS Where was I to begin
BTS Buck did not know of this and as he rounded the bend the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit
BTS but this time his voice was gritty and metallic
BTS Our drift is to the south-east or south-south-east at the rate of at least two miles an hour
BTS The conversation turned upon the Bishop and we got Ernest to explain what he had been doing with him
BTS Anything wrong
BTS This mother-weasel was so small and so savage
BTS In the end the master laughed him out of his dignity
BTS Then I begged her pardon and promised I should not be disheartened any more
BTS He lay partly on his side panting for breath
BTS The speed with which I ran from the galley caused excruciating pain in my knee and I sank down helplessly at the break of the poop
BTS In the fall of 1917 we were not ready
BTS I have been robbed I said to him a little later when I found him pacing up and down the poop alone
BTS Tell me why have you always buried yourself in California
BTS You've made terms with the enemy that's what you've done
BTS I'll merely peep over the bow and see
BTS I'd give five hundred dollars though he added just to be aboard the Macedonia for five minutes listening to my brother curse
BTS Slowly it shifted up along the jugular
BTS Also at times when his god looked at him and spoke to him he betrayed an awkward self-consciousness caused by the struggle of his love to express itself and his physical inability to express it
BTS My knife was at my hip
BTS Her arms were around me her hair was brushing my face
BTS Where she obtained this strength was the marvel to me
BTS he cried savagely shaking his fist at the hungry beasts

BTS I found Jackson the meek and lowly man he had been described
BTS That is the paradox of it he countered
BTS Each time that his teeth struck they sank easily into the yielding flesh while the animal did not seem able to defend itself

BTS Far off to the right a wide smoke haze dimmed the sky--the town of Pullman the soldier chauffeur told us or what had been the town of Pullman for it was utterly destroyed
BTS It is far easier to see brave men die than to hear a coward beg for life
BTS He absurdly insisted upon my addressing him as Mr
BTS d'ye want yer nose punched
BTS They worked the people up until they joined them in the pillage
BTS He did both
BTS And always they pitched camp after dark eating their bit of fish and crawling to sleep into the snow

BTS An' I tell you right now Henry I'm goin' to get her
BTS In the great storm of 1927 while attending a meeting of our leaders he contracted the pneumonia of which he died
BTS From what we can make out Van Dyke must have been a churchman
BTS The Sounding of the Call When Buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for John Thornton he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts and to journey with his partners into the East after a fabled lost mine the history of which was as old as the history of the country
BTS He shook his head
BTS This the younger man endeavoured to accomplish by clutching the bulldog's jaws in his hands and trying to spread them
BTS I wondered what Wolf Larsen could get from it and he read aloud to me from Ecclesiastes
BTS He was ranging at the head of the pack running the wild thing down the living meat to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood
BTS and in consequence a hundred thousand regular soldiers of the United States has been called out to put a frightful end to the whole affair

BTS He looked at me with a pleased expression and said Really this is fine
BTS it will all come right
BTS This was a fearful blow to the socialist propaganda
BTS If the Church was not dumb it will be found not dumb in the books
BTS Bravo
BTS On the contrary idealist that I was to the most pronounced degree my philosophy had always recognized and guerdoned love as the greatest thing in the world the aim and the summit of being the most exquisite pitch of joy and happiness to which life could thrill the thing of all things to be hailed and welcomed and taken into the heart
BTS I don't believe it
BTS Whose instructions
BTS That's what's botherin' me
BTS It's not me duty but me bread an' butter an' the life of me children to stand by the mills
